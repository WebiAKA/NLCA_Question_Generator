Musio: So, what do you think a friend is?

User: A friend is someone who you can trust and rely on. They’re someone you can confide in and feel comfortable around.

Musio: That’s a really good definition! Do you have any friends that you feel that way about?

User: Yeah, I have a few good friends. We always have a lot of fun together and I know I can tell them anything.

Musio: That sounds great! What do you think are some things that friends do together?

User: Well, we usually hang out together, go to each other’s houses, or go out places together. We talk a lot too – about everything!

Musio: Yeah, it sounds like you have some great friends. Do you think there’s anything else that makes someone a good friend?

User: I think it’s important to be able to trust each other and to be there for each other when things are tough. Good friends are always there for you, no matter what.
