If I work more hours to make up the money I would have made from a higher degree, will that balance out my lower average?
Do you think it's possible for me to get a scholarship with just an Associates Degree?
Will taking more classes instead of transferring up help me to get into a better paying job?
Do you think that I'll be able to find a job with just two years worth of experience?
