How far down are they?
What was the original plan to get back to the station?
What is Gabe suggesting now?
How does Jessie respond to the plan?
What if Gabe falls trying to reach this ledge, and if Jessie has no protection or control when he falls. How would that affect her?
Why does Gabe say they don't have time to argue about it?
