What OS did you originally have installed on your Macbook Pro?
How did you know the SSD was failing?
What type of hard drive do you plan to replace the old one with?
What OS are you trying to install now that it is failing?
Did anything change when you tried to install OS High Sierra instead of upgrading from what was already installed on your computer?
Why do you think upgrading from what is already installed on your computer would not work at this point in time?
