How does the old SMB server name come up when connecting to iTunes?
What does it mean for iTunes if the old SMB server is unavailable?
How would clearing all recent connections in the "Connect to Server" dialog help this situation?
How would deleting obsolete keychain entries in "SMB Settings" affect this situation?
