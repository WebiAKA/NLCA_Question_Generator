How often does she come to you for emotional support?
How long has this been happening?
Does she mainly just talk about her problems or do you also talk about other things and feelings, too?
How do you feel when you see her?
Do you have a mutual understanding with her about how much emotional support and time she should take up from you?
Are there certain ways that could make it easier for both of you and/or less exhausting for you to provide this emotional support for your friend, if any?
