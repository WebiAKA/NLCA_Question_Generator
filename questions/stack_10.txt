What was the last thing you did before the white screen?
What was the model of your daughter's MacBook Pro?
Did you try installing OSX on a different hard drive?
Is there any visible damage to your daughter's MacBook Pro?
When did your daughter's MBP start experiencing this issue and why did it take so long for her to come tell you about it?
Do you think this could be related to the hard drive failure itself or possibly something else altogether?
