How do these terms effect the force of gravity?
What is the relation between these two components?
How does pressure affect gravity?
If forces are applied in a direction perpendicular to a surface, what is the relationship between tensile loading and shear stress?
If forces are applied parallel to a surface, what is the relationship between tensile loading and shear stress?
Can these values be negative or positive in FRW context or elastic ball example?
If they can be both, does one create an attractive or repulsive gravitational field?
