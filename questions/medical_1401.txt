How long has the patient been experiencing problems with her feet?
What medications is the patient taking?
What changes in diet, activity, or sleep might be contributing to the patient's foot pain?
What happens when you press on the hyperkeratotic lesion on the plantar side of the patient's left foot near her first metatarsal head?
Does one of this lesion's borders extend to an imaginary line that follows a line on the outer skin at about 45 degrees from heel edge along this border?
Is there any noticeable deformity of this foot at ipsilateral ankle joint?
