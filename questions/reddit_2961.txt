What does it mean to be "under the influence" or "intoxicated"?
What is "marijuana"?
What are the consequences for this behavior?
Is the recent and relevant use of marijuana during the testing period relevant?
What should I say if they ask what happened in the few weeks before the test?
Did second hand smoke actually cause a positive drug test?
Will I still get the job even if I was recent, occasional user?
