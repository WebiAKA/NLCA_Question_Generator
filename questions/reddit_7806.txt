Is there a quarantined professor?
What is being studied?
When did funding for the study end?
Is funding being cut for anyone working with a professor in order to save money?
If the person was only working with their professor for a few months, are they still getting class credit during the quarantine?
Was it necessary to stop working with this professor because of the quarantine or could they have been reassigned to another professor that had not been quarantined?
