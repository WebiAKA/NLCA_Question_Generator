Can variational autoencoders be used as a denoising algorithm?
Would the stochasticity of variational autoencoders prevent them from being successful as a denoising algorithm?
Can Variational Autoencoders be used as a denoising algorithm?
What would be the difference between using standard denoising autoencoders versus variational autoencoders?
Would the stochasticity of the VAE have any affect on its ability to build a good denoiser?
