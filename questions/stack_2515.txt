The main question is what is the best way to do so?
What is a Shapefile?
Are the features plotted correctly on the map?
Is the geoprocessing or loading error occurring as an event and if so, does changing the CRSs in any way allow for the error to be cleared?
If yes, do all CRSs still display the same errors and is reprojection possible using alternative methods such as DB Manager?
