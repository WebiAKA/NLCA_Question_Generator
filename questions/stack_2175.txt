does the Wii U have an equivalent of the time trial option available on Mario Kart 8 Deluxe?
does the game allow for friends to access ghosts that are not top 10 or ranked?
can a Nintendo Switch user share their local ghosts with friends, and vice versa?
Is sharing local ghosts something that can be done more easily on the switch, or is it using the same system as the Wii U?
When downloading \"Online Ghosts\do you have different options besides the top 10 of all time and a few other people within milliseconds of you?
