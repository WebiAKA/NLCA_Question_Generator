what is the name of the account on the VM?
what Linux distribution is installed?
how was the user added to the group on the VM?
Why is the new user unable to Rdp?
Why does it seem to authenticate the same as I do, but then the screen is simply blank?
Is the new user account on the virtual machine preventing them from connecting to RDP on Linux?
What are they able to do that I am not able to do with my credentials?
