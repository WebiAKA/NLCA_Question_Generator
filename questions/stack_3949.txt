What is the goal of the study?
What is a similar study, and why does it provide a relevant benchmark for the acceptance criterion?
How large are samples in both studies?
Can coefficients of variation be compared if the samples differ in size?
Why is the acceptance criterion for this product based on %CV and not another metric?
Could I use the same value of the acceptance criterion for my study to accept if the measurements fit?
