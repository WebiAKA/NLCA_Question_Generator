Have you ever encountered this problem before?
Do you know what computer your running the Ubuntu 18.04 installation on?
What modifications have you done to your computer, such as overclocking it or increasing its fan speed without adjusting the settings or restarting the computer?
Have you tried to install any overclocking applications, such as corsair link or amd cool n quiet?
When did this start happening (day, month, year)?
Did this issue happen after installing an application or hardware onto your computer?
Is there a specific spot on your motherboard where cables are plugged in that might be faulty and affecting the fan speed of nct6775/fan2?
