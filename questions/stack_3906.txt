Why are you not using the exact method for getting the upper limit of the estimated failure rate?
How do you go about determining sample size and power from a Frequentist approach?
Why is it ok to use Jeffreys Interval instead of clopper Pearson interval from a Bayesian approach to estimate the upper limit of the failure rate?
What is Frequentist and Bayesian approach?
What are the best and worst case scenarios for using both approaches for the same test?
How do they differ, and what's the best time to use each one?
