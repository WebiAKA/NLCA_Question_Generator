What is the best way to turn the forklift?
Is it difficult to use because it doesn't have a moving front axle like a car, or is it because he was in control of a different forklift for his previous jobs?
Were any other people there to help train him besides 3 other guys?
How embarrassing is it when he can't turn the forklift properly while everybody else who has tried so far can do so easily?
Does he have other tips that would make learning how to drive a forklift easier for him if you know anything about what's going on with him?
