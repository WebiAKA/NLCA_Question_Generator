How would I calculate the rolling friction of a sphere?
What is the relationship between the properties of a solid sphere and sphere's friction?
How do I find/tune parameters on a physics simulator?
What is the difference between "rolling" and "spinning" friction?
How does mass affect friction?
Why are there different radius sizes in this experiment with mass of 0.1kg and mass of 2.0kg?
