The author has two drives, an internal SSD drive with Windows 10, and a USB flash drive with Ubuntu 17.04 that they wish to install persistent Ubuntu on.
The partition manager does not let the author install onto the external USB drive without modifying the SSD's windows boot partition
The author wishes to replicate what they had in the past where booting a machine without an Ubuntu 14 USB would take them straight to windows and booting with the USB would take them into a persistent Ubuntu 14 that behaved just like a normal internal drive installation (no file or program or setting loss like live versions).
