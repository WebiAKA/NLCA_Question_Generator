What is the length of a long pulse?
What type of switch is being used?
What components are available to extend the pulse form the rising edge?
What does the 500ms pulse extender have to do with a momentary tactile switch?
What is the duration of a typical on/off signal that an SPST momentary tactile switch would send?
Is there a single IC that holds or generates pulses for different lengths of time?
Do we ignore what happens if the button is pressed for longer than 500ms, or when the button has been pressed for less than 500ms but not released before another button press?
