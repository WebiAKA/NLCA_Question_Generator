What happens when light waves go through an aqueous solution that has no dust particles?
Why do we see light in the absence of particles if there is no dust to cause it?
What happens when light goes through pure air or gases?
What happens when light goes through pure water?
Why do we see the light if there is no dust?
Is there any mathematical reasoning or link to this phenomenon?
