Why would a creature with this kind of lifestyle be trainable, let alone domesticatable?
How might one go about domesticating and training them?
Animals that humans have domesticated tend to have similar characteristics: social, active, and preferably herbivorous (with a few exceptions). Mimics are none of these.
As with dogs, they come in various different breeds that vary in size and disposition.  What kinds of breeds are there?
The exact details of their evolutionary progress aren't important (they can be presumed to have evolved from an already existing class of amorphous muscular blobs) but they are a natural creature that evolved in a natural environment, without magic or human involvement (\"wild\" Mimics usually imitate plants or dead animals to lure their prey).  How does this affect the way they think or behave?
What is the main goal for designating these creatures as domesticatable?
