What is the difference between a data warehouse and a relational database?
Can I put a many to many relationship in a star schema?
What are the benefits of using a star schema for an organization's data warehouse?
When is the transaction in this data warehouse happening?
How many tables do you think there are in this relational database?
What is the relationship between the tables?
What type of relationships do they have?
How many columns are there on each table?
Which columns appear the most frequently on a table and which ones appear least frequently (those that have the most and least impact)?
What would happen if we converted this design into a star schema?
