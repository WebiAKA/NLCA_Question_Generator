Is it possible to create a smart playlist containing only songs whose title matches a song found in a specified dumb playlist?
Is it possible to create 320 kbps versions of all my CD-quality songs?
Can the audiobooks on the Nano still have their original CD-quality?
If I wanted to, could I listen to 320 kbps versions of my iPod's playlists on my computer?
