What does "Map rotation" do?
What are the X min, Y min, X max, and Y max extents?
How do I move the map in print composer?
How are the four extents related to the map's current orientation?
Where on the map is the viewer actually seeing?
What does it mean that the X axis and Y axis have been rotated 45 degrees?
Why can't the observer see the whole rotated map in Print Composer?
