What is induction?
What does slip mean?
What is the difference between motoring torque and load torque?
How does the change in slip (s) have any impact on load torque in an induction machine/motor?
Do the load torque also get affected by the slightest measures if not more?
Is it possible that the graph for load torque (BC) is a straight line parallel to y axis rather than increasing slightly as slip tends to 0 because of magnetic flux linkage?
