Why is the interviewer not there?
Why do we know this?
How many days ago did he die and why is his funeral occurring at the same time as the interview?
How much did the deceased person know about the interviewee?
How do you think the interviewee felt when he/she found out that his/her interviewer died in their time slot?
What is the likelihood of this happening if the deceased interviewer had not died when he did?
How does this affect the person receiving the news?
