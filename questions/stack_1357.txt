What if I wanted 60C(~2500ohm) instead of 68C ?
I fudged around with the resistors until I got what I wanted.  How would I go about calculating the values?
How would one measure the temperature of a device without having to worry about running wires to its internals?
How did the author find what is happening with the voltage divider?
What do you think will happen if the author puts a 2K resistor instead of 10K for a temperature differential of 60C versus 25C?
Where does the heat go when the circuit is "off"?
What is a transistor and how does it work?
