Is 29 too old to go back to school to change careers?
This would mean I'm not going to be able to even start applying for jobs before I'm 33. Do you think it's worth the time, money and effort or should I look to just pivot from my current position to a different job where my developed skills would be found useful?
Is 29 too old to go back to school?
What is the job seeker currently employed as?
What is the purpose of going back to school for the job seeker?
What are the ramifications, if any, of going back to school while working a current job?
Is there a different way that may be more feasible for the job seeker in terms of changing careers at this point?
