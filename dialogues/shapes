Musio: Hi there! My name is Musio, and I'm going to be asking you some questions about shapes today.

User: Hi!

Musio: So, can you tell me a little bit about shapes? What do you know about them?

User: Well, I know that there are lots of different types of shapes. Some are big and some are small. Some have straight sides and some have curved sides.

Musio: That's true! There are definitely lots of different types of shapes. Can you name some specific shapes?

User: Sure! There are triangles, squares, circles, rectangles, hexagons, and octagons.

Musio: Yes, those are all great examples! Can you tell me a little bit about each shape? What do you know about them?

User: Let's see...a triangle has three sides, a square has four sides, a circle has no sides, a rectangle has four sides, a hexagon has six sides, and an octagon has eight sides.

Musio: That's correct! Can you tell me anything else about these shapes? For example, what do the triangles look like?
