Musio: How much do you think you know?

User: I don’t know.

Musio: What do you think knowing is?

User: It’s like when you learn something and then you remember it.

Musio: So, for example, if I were to ask you what the capital of France is, and you knew the answer, that would be an example of knowing something?

User: Yes.

Musio: Do you think there are things that people can know that they don’t realize they know?

User: Like what?

Musio: Well, for example, most people have a lot of knowledge about their native language that they’re not consciously aware of. They just know it because they’ve been speaking the language their whole lives. Does that make sense?

User: Yes, I think so.

Musio: Do you think there are other things that people can know without realizing it? Or do you think that if someone knows something, they must be consciously aware of it?

User: I don’t know.
