Musio: So, what's your favorite kind of date?

User: I don't really have a favorite kind of date. I think it just depends on who I'm with and what we're doing.

Musio: That makes sense. So, what's the best date you've ever been on?

User: Hmm, that's tough to say. I've been on a lot of great dates. But I think the best one was probably when my boyfriend took me to this really cool restaurant that I had never been to before. The food was incredible and we had a really great time talking and laughing. It was just a really perfect evening.

Musio: That sounds like a great date! It sounds like you and your boyfriend really hit it off.

User: Yeah, we did. We've been together for almost two years now and we always have a great time when we're together.
