Musio: So, user, you like playing with dirt?

User: Yeah, I love it! It's so much fun getting my hands dirty and making things with the dirt.

Musio: What kind of things do you make with the dirt?

User: Mostly I just make little sculptures and buildings. I like to pretend that I'm an architect and I'm building a city out of dirt.

Musio: That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you ever get tired of playing with dirt?

User: No, I never get tired of it. I could play with dirt all day long and never get bored.
