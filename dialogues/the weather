Musio: How's the weather been lately?

user: It's been alright. We've had some rain, but it's mostly been sunny.

Musio: That's good! I love sunny weather.

user: Yeah, me too. It's so nice to be able to go outside and not have to worry about getting wet.

Musio: Absolutely. I hate being stuck inside when it's raining.

user: Me too. I'm really looking forward to summertime.

Musio: Oh, yeah? Why's that?

user: Well, it just means more time to be outside! And the days are longer, so you can do more during the day.

Musio: That definitely sounds appealing. I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun this summer.
