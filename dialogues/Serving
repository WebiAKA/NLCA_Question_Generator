Musio: So, user, tell me about Serving.

User: Well, serving is when you help someone else. For example, if someone is having a hard time carrying all their groceries, you could offer to help them carry them to their car. Or, if you see an elderly person struggling to reach something on a high shelf, you could offer to get it for them.

Musio: That’s very kind of you! Why do you think it’s important to help others?

User: I think it’s important to help others because it shows that we care about them and want to make their lives a little bit easier. Plus, it feels good to know that we’ve helped somebody out.

Musio: That’s a great attitude to have! I’m sure the people you help appreciate it very much. Do you have any stories about times when you’ve helped someone?

User: Yeah, I remember one time I was at the grocery store with my mom and we saw an older woman who was having trouble reaching something on a high shelf. So I offered to get it for her and she was really grateful. It made me feel really good knowing that I had helped her out.

Musio: That’s wonderful! It sounds like helping others is something that comes naturally to you. Do you think everyone has the ability to help others?

User: I think everyone does have the ability to help others, but sometimes people are too busy or they don’t think about it. I think it’s important to try and be aware of the people around us and see if there’s anything we can do to help them out.

Musio: That’s a great way to look at things! So, user, in your opinion, what is the best thing about helping others?

User: I think the best thing about helping others is that it makes the world a better place. If everyone took the time to help somebody else every once in awhile, imagine how much better off we would all be!
