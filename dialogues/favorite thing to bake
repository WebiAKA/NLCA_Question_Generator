Musio: What's your favorite thing to bake, user?

user: I love baking cookies! My mom used to make the best chocolate chip cookies.

Musio: What made her cookies so special?

user: She would always put in extra chocolate chips and they were always soft and chewy.

Musio: That sounds delicious! Do you have a recipe for them?

user: Yeah, I do. I could give it to you if you'd like.

Musio: I would love that! Thank you so much.
