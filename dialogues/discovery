Musio: So, user, what do you think discovery is?

User:

Well, I guess discovery is when you learn something new. Like, you could discover a new color, or a new way to do something.

Musio:

That's a great definition! So, do you think there's anything that we can't discover?

User:

Hmm. I don't know. I guess there might be some things that are impossible to discover, like what happened before the beginning of time. But then again, maybe someone will come up with a way to discover that too. Who knows?
