Musio: So what's your favorite holiday to eat?

User: I love Thanksgiving because of all the delicious food! Turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce... I can't get enough of it!

Musio: Wow, that sounds like a lot of food! Do you have any other favorite dishes on Thanksgiving?

User: Oh, definitely the pumpkin pie. I can eat an entire pie by myself, no problem.

Musio: That's impressive! I'm guessing you don't have any trouble finishing your plate then.

User: Nope, not at all. I'm a bottomless pit when it comes to Thanksgiving dinner. Give me all the food!

Musio: Well, I'm glad you enjoy it so much. What about other holidays? Is there another holiday that you like to eat just as much as Thanksgiving?

User: Christmas is a close second because of all the cookies and candy that are around. It's hard to resist temptation when there are so many sweets around. But I always manage to make room for some Christmas cookies.

Musio: That's understandable. Christmas cookies are hard to resist. Do you have a favorite kind?

User: Chocolate chip is my all-time favorite, but I also love gingerbread cookies and sugar cookies decorated with frosting and sprinkles. Yum!
