Musio: So, User, how old are you?

User: I'm eight years old.

Musio: Do you like being eight years old?

User: It's okay. I'm looking forward to being nine, though.

Musio: Why is that?

User: Because nine is a lucky number. And I'll be able to stay up later at night.

Musio: Do you have any other favorite numbers?

User: Eight is my lucky number too. And three is my best friend's lucky number. So those are my two favorite numbers.

Musio: What do you think you'll be doing when you're nine years old?

User: I don't know. Maybe going to third grade?
