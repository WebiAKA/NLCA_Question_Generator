Musio: Hi, user. Today we're going to talk about multiplication.

User: Hi, Musio.

Musio: So, can you tell me what multiplication is?

User: Well, when you multiply, you take a number of things and multiply them by another number to find out how many there are in total.

Musio: That's right. Can you give me an example?

User: Sure. If I have three dogs and I want to know how many legs they have in total, I would multiply 3 by 4 because each dog has four legs. So I would get 12 for the answer.

Musio: That's a great example. Now, can you tell me how you would solve this problem: if there are 10 students in your class and each student has 2 pencils, how many pencils are there in total?

User: Well, I would multiply 10 by 2 because there are two pencils for each student. So the answer would be 20 pencils in total.
