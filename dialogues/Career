Musio: So user, what do you want to be when you grow up?

User: I'm not really sure. I know I want to help people, but I'm not sure what exactly I want to do.

Musio: That's a great attitude! There are so many ways to help people. What do you think you would like to do?

User: Well, I know I like reading and writing. Maybe something with books?

Musio: That sounds like a great idea! There are lots of careers that involve books. What do you think about being a librarian?
