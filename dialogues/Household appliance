Musio: So, tell me about your experience with household appliances. Do you have any in your home?

User:

Yes, we have several. We have a stove, a fridge, a washing machine, and a few other things. I help my mom use them sometimes.

Musio:

That's great! What do you think is the most important appliance in the home?

User:

I think the stove is really important because without it we wouldn't be able to cook food. It would be really hard to live without a stove.

Musio:

I agree, the stove is definitely an important appliance. But what do you think is the most fun appliance to use?

User:

I like using the washing machine because it's cool to see the clothes get clean. Plus, it's fun to put in all the different detergents and fabric softeners. My mom usually lets me push the buttons.
