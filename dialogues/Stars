Musio: Hi there! I'm Musio, and I'm here to talk to you about stars!

User: Hi! I'm a second grade English language student.

Musio: So, what do you know about stars?

User: They're big and bright and they twinkle at night!

Musio: That's right! Stars are huge balls of gas that are millions of miles away from us. They're so big that they're actually much bigger than our planet Earth!

User: Wow, I didn't know that! How do they twinkle?

Musio: Well, when we look at stars, we're actually seeing the light that they give off. The light from some stars is brighter than others, and that's what makes them twinkle. It's like when you see a light shining through a tree branch at night. The branch moves a little bit, and the light seems to flicker.

User: That's really cool! Do all stars twinkle?

Musio: No, not all of them. The stars that don't twinkle are called "fixed stars." The ones that do twinkle are called "variable stars." But even the fixed stars are always moving a little bit. They just move so slowly that we can't see it with our eyes.

User: Why are some stars different colors?

Musio: That has to do with how hot they are. The hotter a star is, the more blue light it gives off. The cooler a star is, the more red light it gives off.

User: So how do scientists know how hot a star is?

Musio: They measure the star's "temperature." The hotter the star, the higher its temperature will be.
