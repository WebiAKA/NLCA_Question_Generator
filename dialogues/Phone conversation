Musio: So, user, can you tell me about a time when you had a phone conversation in English?

User: Well, I remember that I once had to call my teacher to ask her about a homework assignment. It was really tough because I didn't know how to say "teacher" in English.

Musio: What did you do?

User: I just said "lady" instead.

Musio: And what happened?

User: She understood me and we had a really great conversation about the homework. After that, I started using "lady" whenever I needed to talk to someone on the phone in English.

Musio: That's interesting. Can you tell me more about your experience with having phone conversations in English?
