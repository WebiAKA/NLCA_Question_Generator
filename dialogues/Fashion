Musio: So, what do you think about fashion?

User: I think it's really cool! I like being able to dress up and look nice.

Musio: Yeah, fashion can be a lot of fun. But it can also be expensive.

User: Yeah, I know. My mom doesn't like to spend a lot of money on clothes for me, so I have to be careful about what I buy.

Musio: That makes sense. So, do you have any favorite fashion designers or brands?

User: I really like Nike and Adidas. I also like Forever 21 and H&M.

Musio: Those are all great brands! What do you like about them?

User: I like that they're stylish but still affordable. And I always feel comfortable in their clothes.
