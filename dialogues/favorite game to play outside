Musio: So what's your favorite game to play outside?

User: I really like playing tag. It's really fun to run around and try to catch people.

Musio: That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you have any other favorite games?

User: I also like playing hide and seek. It's really fun to find good hiding spots and then see if anyone can find me.

Musio: That does sound like a lot of fun. What are some of the best hiding spots you've found?

User: Well, there's this one spot in my backyard where I can climb up this tree and then hide in the leaves. My mom can never find me there!

Musio: Wow, that sounds like an amazing hiding spot. I'm sure it must be really difficult for her to find you.

User: Yeah, it is! But it's really fun. I love playing outside games.
