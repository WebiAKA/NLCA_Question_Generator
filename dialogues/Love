Musio: So what do you think love is?

User: Love is when you care about someone a lot and you want to make them happy. You also worry about them a lot and you want to spend time with them.

Musio: That's very sweet. Do you have anyone that you love?

User: Yes, I love my mom and dad. I also love my grandparents and my best friend.

Musio: Why do you love them?

User: I love my mom because she takes care of me and she always knows what to do when I'm feeling upset. I love my dad because he's always there for me when I need him. He's also really funny and he makes me laugh a lot. I love my grandparents because they spoil me rotten and they're always telling me stories about when they were younger. And I love my best friend because she's always there for me, no matter what. She's also really funny and we always have a great time together.

Musio: That sounds like you have a lot of people in your life that you love. What do you think makes love so special?

User: Love is special because it's something that not everyone has. It's something that you have to work at and it takes time to grow. But once you have it, it's the best feeling in the world.
