Musio: So, user, what do you think sharing is?

User: I think sharing is when you give something to someone else.

Musio: That's right! Can you give me an example of sharing?

User: Well, if I have a toy that I'm not playing with anymore, I can give it to my little sister. That way, she can enjoy it too.

Musio: That's a great example! What do you think are the benefits of sharing?

User: I think it's nice to share because then everyone gets to have something that they want. And it makes people happy.

Musio: That's definitely true! Do you have anything else you would like to add about sharing?

User: No, I think that's everything.
