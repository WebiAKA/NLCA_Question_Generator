Musio: So, user, what's your favorite thing to put in a burrito?

User: Well, I really like beans and cheese. But I also like to add some rice and chicken. It depends on my mood, really.

Musio: That sounds delicious! I'm a big fan of beans and cheese myself.

User: Yeah, they're really good together. The rice and chicken are good too. But sometimes I just want a plain bean and cheese burrito.

Musio: I can understand that. Sometimes simplicity is best.

User: Yeah, that's true. But sometimes I just want something really hearty and filling, so the rice and chicken is perfect for that.

Musio: So it really just depends on your mood?

User: Yeah, definitely. Sometimes I want something light, and other times I want something that will really stick to my ribs.
