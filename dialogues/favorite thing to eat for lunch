Musio: So, what's your favorite thing to eat for lunch?

User: I really like PB&J sandwiches.

Musio: Why do you like them?

User: They're really tasty and easy to make. Plus, I can add different things to them to change them up a bit.

Musio: That sounds great! Do you have a favorite PB&J combination?

User: My favorite is probably grape jelly and peanut butter with banana slices. It's really sweet and filling.

Musio: That does sound delicious! I'll have to try that sometime. Do you always have PB&J for lunch?

User: No, sometimes I'll have leftovers from dinner or something else simple like grilled cheese or a ham sandwich. But PB&J is definitely my go-to lunch.
