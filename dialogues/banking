Musio: So, what do you know about banking?

User: Well, I know that banks are where people can deposit their money and earn interest on it. And people can also take out loans from banks.

Musio: That's right. What else do you know about banking?

User: Umm... let's see. I know that banks keep track of people's money and make sure it's safe. They also help people save for things like buying a house or going to college.

Musio: That's all very true. Do you have any questions about banking?

User: Not that I can think of right now.
