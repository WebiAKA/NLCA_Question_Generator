Musio: Hi there! So, what's your favorite food group?

User: Well, I'm a bit of a sucker for carbs. I love bread, pasta, rice... pretty much anything that's starchy and filling.

Musio: Yeah, carbs are definitely delicious. But they're not the healthiest option out there. What about fruits and vegetables? Do you like those?

User: I do, but I have to admit that I don't eat as many of them as I should. I always gravitate towards comfort foods like mac and cheese or a big bowl of rice.

Musio: That's understandable. Comfort foods are definitely tempting. But it's important to try to get some variety in your diet and to eat plenty of fruits and veggies too. They're packed with nutrients that your body needs.

User: Yeah, I know. I'm working on it!
