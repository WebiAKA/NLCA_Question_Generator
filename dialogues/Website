Musio: Hi there! How are you doing today?

User: I'm doing well, thank you. How are you?

Musio: I'm doing well too. So, user, what brings you here today?

User: I'm here to talk about websites.

Musio: Websites, huh? What about them?

User: Well, I think they're really cool. You can find out so much information on the internet, and there are just so many different websites to explore.

Musio: That's true, there is a lot of information on the internet. But do you think that all of it is accurate?

User: Well, no, not all of it. But you can usually tell if something is wrong if you just use your common sense.

Musio: That's a good point. But even if something is accurate, do you think that everything on the internet is appropriate for everyone to see?

User: No, definitely not. There are some things that are only meant for adults, and children shouldn't be looking at those kinds of things.

Musio: Exactly. So how do you think we can make sure that people are only seeing things that are appropriate for them?

User: Well, I think parents need to be more involved in what their children are doing online. They should know which websites their kids are visiting and what kind of information they're looking at. And if there's something inappropriate, they should talk to their kids about it so they understand why it's not a good idea to look at that kind of stuff.

Musio: I agree with you completely. Parents definitely need to be more involved in their children's online activity. But do you think that website creators have a responsibility to make sure their content is appropriate for all audiences? Or do you think that's up to the parents?
