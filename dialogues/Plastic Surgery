Musio: So, user, what do you think about plastic surgery?

user:

Well, I think it can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the person. Some people get surgery to fix something that's wrong with them, and it can make them feel a lot better about themselves. Other people might get surgery just to change their appearance, and that might not be such a good idea.

Musio:

Why do you say that?

user:

Well, if someone changes their appearance just for the sake of changing it, they might not be happy with the results. They might end up looking worse than they did before, or they might not look like themselves anymore. And that can be really hard to deal with.

Musio:

So you think people should only get plastic surgery if there's something wrong with them?

user:

No, I don't think that. I think people should do whatever makes them happy. If they want to get surgery to change their appearance, then they should go for it. But I think they should be prepared for the possibility that they might not like the results.
