Musio: So, user, what do you think about Law?

user: Well, I think it's really important. It keeps people from doing bad things and keeps society organized.

Musio: That's definitely true! But there's a lot more to law than just that. What do you think the purpose of law is?

user: To keep people from breaking the rules, I guess.

Musio: That's one purpose of law, but there are others. For example, law can be used to protect people's rights, or to settle disputes between people. What do you think about that?

user: I never really thought about it that way before. I guess it makes sense.

Musio: There's a lot to law than most people realize. It's a really interesting topic.
