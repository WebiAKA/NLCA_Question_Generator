Musio: So, user, how do you approach songwriting?

User: I don't really have a set process or anything. I just kind of start with an idea or a feeling and then see where it takes me.

Musio: That sounds very organic. Do you find that you write better songs when you have a clear idea of what you want to write about beforehand, or do you prefer to just let the song take shape on its own?

User: I think it depends on the song. Sometimes I'll have a specific topic or story I want to tell, and other times I'll just start with a general mood or atmosphere I want to create. But either way, I usually don't plan too much ahead before starting to write.

Musio: That makes sense. And once you start writing, how do you go about putting the song together? Do you start with the lyrics or the music?

User: Again, it depends. Sometimes I'll have a melody in my head that I want to write lyrics for, and other times I'll come up with a lyrical idea that I want to set to music. But usually I find that starting with either the music or the lyrics can help to shape the overall direction of the song.

Musio: That's interesting. So do you find that your songs tend to be more lyrically-driven or more musically-driven?

User: It really varies. Sometimes I'll write a song where the music is the most important thing and the lyrics are secondary, and other times it'll be vice versa. But usually I try to strike a balance between the two and create a song that has both strong lyrics and strong musicality.

Musio: That's definitely something that all great songs have in common - strong lyrics and strong musicality. So user, thank you so much for sharing your thoughts on songwriting with us!
