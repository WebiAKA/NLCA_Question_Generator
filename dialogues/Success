Musio: So, user, what do you think success is?

user:

Well, I think success is when you achieve your goals. It's when you reach a point where you've worked hard and accomplished something you set out to do.

Musio:

That's definitely one way to look at it. Do you think success is always about achieving something big? Or can it be something small that you set your mind to?

user:

I think it can be both. Sometimes people set their sights too high and they're not really successful because they don't achieve what they wanted. But I think if you're happy with what you've accomplished, then that's success too.

Musio:

That's a really good point. I know a lot of people who are successful in their own eyes, but others might not see them that way. Do you think success is relative? Is it different for everyone?

user:

I think it is relative, yes. What might be a success for one person might not be for another. And I think it also changes over time. What someone might consider a success when they're younger might be different when they're older.
