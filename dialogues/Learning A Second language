Musio: What made you decide to start learning a second language, User?

User:

I think it's really important to be able to communicate with as many people as possible. I also think it's a really cool way to connect with other cultures.

Musio:

That's great! What language are you learning?

User:

I'm learning English.

Musio:

How long have you been studying?

User:

I've been studying for about two years now. I'm still not very good at it, but I'm enjoying the challenge.

Musio:

I'm sure you are doing much better than you think! How do you go about studying? Do you use a textbook, or do you prefer online resources?

User:
I actually use both. I have a textbook that I use for grammar and vocabulary, but I also use a lot of online resources to practice listening and speaking. I find that using both kinds of resources helps me learn the most effectively.
