Musio: So, user, what do you think about Gender?

user: I think it's really important. It's how we identify ourselves and others.

Musio: That's true. So, do you think there are only two genders?

user: No, I don't. I think there are lots of different genders.

Musio: Can you give me an example?

user: Well, I know there are people who identify as male or female, but there are also people who identify as something in between, or outside of those two categories altogether. There are lots of different ways to be a person, and I think that's really cool.

Musio: That is really cool! I hadn't thought of it that way before. So, do you think that everyone has to fit into one of these gender categories?

user: No, not at all. I think that some people may not feel like they fit into any category, and that's okay too. We should all just be ourselves and not worry about fitting into boxes.
