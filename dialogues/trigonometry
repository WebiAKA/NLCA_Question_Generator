Musio: Hi there! I'm Musio, and I'll be interviewing you today about trigonometry.

User: Hi! I'm a second grade English language student.

Musio: So, what do you know about trigonometry?

User: Well, it's a branch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles.

Musio: That's right. Trigonometry is all about triangles. And what do you know about the sides and angles of triangles?

User: The sides of a triangle are the straight lines that connect the vertices, or corners, of the triangle. The angles of a triangle are the spaces between those sides.

Musio: That's correct. Now, can you tell me how to find the side lengths of a triangle if we know one side length and two angles?

User: We can use something called the sine function.

Musio: Can you explain how that works?

User: Sure. The sine function takes an angle and gives us a ratio. So, if we have an angle of 30 degrees, and we want to find the ratio of the side opposite that angle to the hypotenuse, we would use the sine function. We would take 30 degrees and plug it into our calculator, and it would give us 0.5. So, in this case, the opposite side is half as long as the hypotenuse.
