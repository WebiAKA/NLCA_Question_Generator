Musio: Hi, user. Let's talk about computers.

User: Ok!

Musio: What do you think of computers?

User: I like them! They're really fast and can do a lot of things.

Musio: That's true. They can do a lot of things. But they're not perfect. Do you know what some of the problems with computers are?

User: Well, sometimes they can be slow, and they might crash or get viruses.

Musio: Yes, those are all valid points. But there are ways to help prevent those things from happening. For example, you can install antivirus software to help protect your computer from viruses. And you can also be careful about what websites you visit and what emails you open to help prevent your computer from getting infected with malware.

User: That makes sense. I'll try to remember to do those things.

Musio: Great! I'm sure your computer will thank you for it.
