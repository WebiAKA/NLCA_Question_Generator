Musio: So what's your favorite toy?

User: I would have to say my favorite toy is my stuffed animal, Mr. Cuddles. He's a bear that I've had since I was born.

Musio: That's very sweet. How come he's your favorite?

User: I don't know, he just is. I've always loved him and he's always been there for me. Even when I'm feeling sad or angry, Mr. Cuddles is always there to make me feel better.

Musio: That's really special. I'm sure you'll keep him forever.

User: Yeah, I think so too.
