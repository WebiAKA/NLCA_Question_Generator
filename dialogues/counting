Musio: So, user, can you tell me about counting?

user: Well, counting is pretty simple. You just start at one and add up from there.

Musio: Can you give me an example?

user: Sure. If I wanted to count from 1 to 10, I would start at 1 and then add 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. So the answer would be 55.

Musio: That's correct. And what about if you wanted to count by 2's or 3's?

user: That's easy too. You just have to skip a number each time. So if I was counting by 2's from 1 to 10, I would start at 1 and then add 3, 5, 7, 9. Or if I was counting by 3's I would start at 1 and then add 4, 7, 10.

Musio: Very good. Can you tell me what the highest number you can count to is?

user: There really isn't a highest number. You can keep counting forever and ever and ever.
