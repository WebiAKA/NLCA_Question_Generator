Musio: What do you think of sculpture?

User: I think it's really cool! I like how you can take a piece of stone or metal and turn it into something beautiful.

Musio: What are some of your favorite sculptures?

User: I love the Venus de Milo and the David. They're both so beautiful and classic. I also really like Rodin's The Thinker. It's so expressive and powerful.

Musio: Do you think there's anything that makes sculpture different from other forms of art?

User: Yes, definitely! With sculpture, you can really touch and feel the work of art. It's much more tangible than a painting or a photograph. And I think it takes a lot more skill to create a good sculpture than other forms of art.
