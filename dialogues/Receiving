Musio: So, user, tell me about a time when you received something.

User: Well, there was this one time when I got a really cool toy from my grandpa. I was so happy!

Musio: That sounds great! What made it so special?

User: I don't know, I just really loved it. It was a toy robot and I used to play with it all the time.

Musio: That's awesome! I'm sure you were really happy to get that. Did you ever give it away or sell it?

User: No, I still have it. I keep it in my room and sometimes I'll take it out and play with it again. It's really special to me.
