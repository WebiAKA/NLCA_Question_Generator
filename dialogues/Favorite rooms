Musio: What is your favorite room in your house?

User:

My favorite room in my house is my bedroom. I love spending time in my bedroom because it feels like my own personal space. I can do whatever I want in my bedroom, and I don't have to worry about anyone else. It's just a really cozy and relaxing place for me.
