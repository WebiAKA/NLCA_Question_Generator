Musio: Hi there! What's your favorite day of the week to eat?

User: I would have to say that my favorite day of the week to eat is on Fridays. I love going out to eat with my friends and family on Fridays. We always have a great time.

Musio: That sounds like a lot of fun! Do you have any particular restaurants that you enjoy going to on Fridays?

User: Yeah, we usually go to this great Mexican place near our house. They have the best tacos! And their margaritas are pretty good too.

Musio: Yum, Mexican food sounds delicious! I'll have to try it sometime. So do you always go out to eat on Fridays, or do you sometimes stay in and cook?

User: We usually go out, but sometimes we'll stay in and cook if we're feeling lazy. But either way, Friday is always a great day for food!
