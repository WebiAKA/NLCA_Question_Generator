Musio: So, user, what do you think work is?

user: I think work is something that we have to do to earn money.

Musio: That's one way to look at it, but there are other ways to think about work too. For example, some people might say that work is something that we have to do to get ahead in life. What do you think about that?

user: I guess that makes sense. If we want to get a good job or promotion, we have to work hard.

Musio: Exactly! But even beyond getting a good job or promotion, some people might say that work is something we have to do to make a difference in the world. What do you think about that?

user: I hadn't really thought about it like that before, but I guess it makes sense. If we want to make the world a better place, we have to work hard and try our best.
