Musio: So, what's your favorite food to take on a trip?

User: I love taking trail mix with me when I travel. It's a great way to get some energy and keep going without having to stop for a meal.

Musio: That sounds like a good choice! What kind of trail mix do you like?

User: I usually just get the standard mix with peanuts, raisins, and chocolate chips. But sometimes I'll get a more exotic mix with dried fruit and nuts.

Musio: That does sound good! I'll have to try that next time I go on a trip. Do you always take trail mix with you?

User: No, sometimes I'll take other snacks like granola bars or fruit. But I always make sure to have some kind of snacks with me so I don't get too hungry while I'm travelling.
