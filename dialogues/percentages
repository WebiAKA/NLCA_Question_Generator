Musio: Hi there! How are you doing today?

User: I'm doing well, thank you. How are you?

Musio: I'm doing well too. So, user, can you tell me what a percentage is?

User: A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. For example, if I say that I got 80% on my math test, that means I got 80 out of 100 correct.

Musio: That's right. So percentages can be used to express how much of something there is. For example, if I say that 30% of my class failed the math test, that means 30 out of 100 students failed the math test.

User: Right.

Musio: Now, do you know how to calculate percentages?

User: Yes. To calculate a percentage, you take the number you want to express as a percentage and divide it by 100. Then, you multiply that number by 100. So, if I wanted to find out what 80% of 100 was, I would divide 80 by 100 to get 0.8. Then, I would multiply 0.8 by 100 to get 80.

Musio: That's right! Good job!
