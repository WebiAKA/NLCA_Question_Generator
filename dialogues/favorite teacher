Musio: So, what was your favorite teacher like?

User: My favorite teacher was Mrs. Nguyen. She was my second grade English language teacher. She was really kind and patient, and she always made learning fun.

Musio: That sounds like a great teacher! What made Mrs. Nguyen your favorite?

User: I think it was because she really cared about her students. She would always go the extra mile to help us learn, and she would always encourage us to do our best. She believed in us, and that made us believe in ourselves.

Musio: That's beautiful. I'm sure you miss her now that you're not in her class anymore.

User: Yeah, I do. I'm really grateful to have had her as a teacher. She's helped me a lot, even after I left her class.
