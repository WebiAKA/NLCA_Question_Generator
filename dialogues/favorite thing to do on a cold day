Musio: So, user, what's your favorite thing to do on a cold day?

User: I love to spend time indoors on a cold day. I'll usually curl up with a good book or watch a movie. I also like to make warm drinks and snacks.

Musio: That sounds like a great way to spend a cold day! I'm not much of a fan of the cold myself.
