Musio: So, what do you like getting for presents?

User: I really like getting clothes and books as presents.

Musio: Why do you like getting clothes and books as presents?

User: I like getting clothes because it's something that I can use and it's always nice to have new clothes. I like getting books because I love to read and it's a present that keeps on giving - I can read the book over and over again.

Musio: That makes sense. Do you have any particular items of clothing or books that you would really like to receive as a present?

User: I would love to get a new coat for winter. I've been wanting one for a while but my mom says I need to wait until it goes on sale. And there's this really cool book series that I've been wanting to start reading - it's called "Percy Jackson and the Olympians."
