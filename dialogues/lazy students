Musio: So user, how do you think about lazy students?

User: Well, I think that they're probably just lazy because they don't want to put in the effort. Or maybe they're not interested in the subject.

Musio: Yeah, I can see how that could be the case. But do you think that there's anything else that could be going on with them?

User: I don't know. Maybe they don't have good study habits, or maybe they're just not very smart.

Musio: Well, those are both valid points. But do you think that there's anything that teachers or parents can do to help lazy students?

User: I don't know. Maybe they should try to make the material more interesting, or give them more encouragement.

Musio: Yeah, those are both good ideas. But do you think that there's anything else that can be done to help lazy students?
