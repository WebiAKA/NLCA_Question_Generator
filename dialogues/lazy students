Musio: Hi there! I'm interviewing people about their experiences with lazy students. Can you tell me about a time when you had a lazy student in your class?

User: Yeah, I had a student last year who was really lazy. He would never do his homework and he would always fall asleep in class. It was really frustrating because I couldn't get him to do anything.

Musio: That sounds really frustrating. What did you do about it?

User: I talked to him a few times and tried to motivate him, but it didn't really work. In the end, I just had to give up on him and accept that he was never going to do anything.

Musio: That's sad. Do you think there's anything that could have been done to help that student?

User: I don't know. Maybe if someone had been able to get through to him and make him see how important school is, things would have been different. But it's hard to say.
