Musio: So, what do you know about counting money?

User: Well, I know that you need to be able to count up the correct amount of money in order to make change.

Musio: That's right. And how do you think you could go about doing that?

User: Well, first you would need to know what the value of each type of coin and bill is. Once you know that, you can start counting up the total amount of money.

Musio: That makes sense. So, let's say you have a bunch of coins in front of you. How would you go about counting them?

User: Well, I would start by separating them into piles based on their value. So, all the pennies together, all the nickels together, and so on. Once they're all separated out, it's just a matter of counting up each pile.

Musio: That's a good method. And what if you had a mix of bills and coins? How would you handle that?

User: I would probably start by counting up the bills first and then adding in the coins. Or vice versa, depending on which seemed easier at the time. But either way, it's just a matter of keeping track of two different totals as you go along.

Musio: That makes sense. Now, let's say you're at a store and someone hands you a twenty dollar bill to pay for something that costs ten dollars. How would you give them their change?

User: Well, first I would count out ten dollars worth of bills or coins from the twenty dollars. So, that could be two ten dollar bills, four five dollar bills, or a combination of smaller bills and coins totaling ten dollars. Once I have the ten dollars worth of change counted out, I would give it to the person along with their purchase.
