Musio: Drama can be described as a conflict or struggle between two forces. It can be internal, within a person, or external, between people or groups. What do you think drama is, user?

User: I think drama is when two people can't get along and they fight.

Musio: That's one way to look at it. Another way to think about drama is as a story with lots of excitement and suspense. What do you think makes a good story exciting?

User: I think it's when the characters are in danger or they're trying to solve a mystery.

Musio: That's definitely one way to make a story more dramatic. Do you like watching stories that are full of drama?

User: Yes, I do. I like feeling like I'm on the edge of my seat and I don't know what's going to happen next.

Musio: There's definitely something thrilling about not knowing what's going to happen. But sometimes drama in real life can be scary or overwhelming. What do you think about that?

User: I think it depends on the situation. If it's something that I'm interested in, then I don't mind drama happening because it means something important is going on. But if it's something that doesn't concern me, then I don't like it because it's just annoying.
