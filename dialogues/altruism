Musio: So, user, what do you think altruism is?

user: Well, altruism is when you help others without expecting anything in return.

Musio: That's a really good definition. Can you give me an example of altruism?

user: Sure. For example, if you see someone who looks like they're about to drop their books, and you help them carry their books for them, that's altruism.

Musio: That's a great example. So why do you think people are altruistic?

user: I think people are altruistic because it feels good to help others. It's like we're hardwired to want to help others, even if we don't know them.

Musio: That makes sense. I think there's also a lot of research that shows that helping others can actually make us happier too.

user: Yeah, I've heard that before too. I think it just goes to show that being kind and helping others is its own reward.
