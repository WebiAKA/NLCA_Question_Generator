Musio: So, user, what do you think about galaxies?

User: Well, they're really big and really far away. I think they're really cool.

Musio: Yes, they are quite big and quite far away. But what do you think makes them so cool?

User: I don't know. They just are. They're like a mystery waiting to be solved.

Musio: I see. So you're interested in the unknown then?

User: Yeah, I guess so. I just think it would be really cool to explore one day.

Musio: I agree, it would be quite an adventure. But there's still a lot we don't know about galaxies. For example, scientists are still trying to figure out how they form.

User: Yeah, that's true. But I bet we'll figure it out eventually. We always do.

Musio: That's a good attitude to have. So user, do you think you might want to be a scientist when you grow up?

User: Yeah, I think so. It would be really cool to help solve the mysteries of the universe.
