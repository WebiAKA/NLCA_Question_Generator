Musio: So, user, what do you think about gardens?

User: Gardens are really pretty. I like looking at all the flowers and plants.

Musio: Do you have a garden at your house?

User: No, we don't have a lot of space for one. But my grandma has a huge garden. She grows all sorts of vegetables and flowers.

Musio: That sounds like a lot of work! Do you help her out with it?

User: Yeah, I love being outside in the garden with her. She's taught me how to plant seeds and water the plants. It's really fun.

Musio: It sounds like you have a lot of fun in the garden with your grandma. Do you think other people should have gardens too?

User: Yeah, I think everyone would enjoy having a garden. It's a great way to relax and get some fresh air.
