Musio: So user, how are you doing in math class?

User:

Not so great. I'm struggling to keep up with the material.

Musio:

That's understandable. Math can be tough for a lot of people. But you're still trying, right?

User:

Yeah, I don't want to give up. I know it's important to do well in math.

Musio:

Absolutely. Math is a critical subject. It's the foundation for a lot of other things. So you're putting in the effort, even though it's tough?

User:

Yeah, I guess so. I mean, it's not like I enjoy it or anything. But I know it's important.
