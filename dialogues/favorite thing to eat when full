Musio: Yeah, I can understand that. Pizza is definitely one of my favorite comfort foods. What about you? What's your favorite thing to eat when you're full?

user: I also really like ice cream. It's so creamy and satisfying. And there are so many different flavors to choose from.

Musio: That sounds great! I love ice cream too. What's your favorite flavor?
