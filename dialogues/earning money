Musio: So, user, how do you earn money?

user: I don't really know. My mommy and daddy give me money when I do things for them or when I behave well.

Musio: That's interesting. Do you think you could earn money by doing something for someone else?

user: Yeah, I think so. My friends sometimes give me money when I do something for them, like play with them or get them a snack.

Musio: That's great! So you think that if you did something that someone else wanted or needed, they would give you money?

user: Yeah, I guess so.

Musio: What do you think are some things that people might need or want?

user: Well, people might need help cleaning up their room or getting groceries from the store. Or maybe they just want someone to play a game with them or listen to them talk.

Musio: Those are all great ideas! So if you helped someone clean up their room, you think they would give you money?

user: Yeah, maybe. Or at least they would say thank you.
