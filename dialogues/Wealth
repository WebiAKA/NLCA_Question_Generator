Musio: So, what do you think about wealth?

User: Well, I think it's important to have a lot of money.

Musio: Why do you think that?

User: Because it means you can buy things you want and have a better life.

Musio: Some people would say that wealth isn't necessarily about having a lot of money, but about having a good life. What do you think about that?

Musio: Exactly. So, do you think that wealth is something that's important to you?

User: Yes, I definitely do. I want to be wealthy so that I can have a good life.
