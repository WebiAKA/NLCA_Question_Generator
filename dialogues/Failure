Musio: So, user, can you tell me what you think failure is?

User: Well, I guess failure is when you don't achieve what you set out to do.

Musio: That's a really good definition. Can you give me an example of something that you consider to be a failure?

User: Well, last year I was really hoping to get an A in my English class, but I ended up with a B+. So I guess that was a bit of a failure.

Musio: That doesn't sound like such a big deal to me. It sounds like you did your best and you still got a good grade.

User: I guess you're right. But it's just frustrating when you don't meet your own expectations, you know?

Musio: Absolutely. I think we've all been there at some point. So, do you think that people can learn from their failures?

User: Definitely! I mean, if you don't learn from your mistakes then you're bound to keep making them over and over again.

Musio: Exactly! So it sounds like you view failure as a positive thing then?

User: Absolutely. Without failure we wouldn't know what success tastes like, right?
