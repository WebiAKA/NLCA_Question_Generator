Musio: Hi there! How are you today?

User:

I'm good, thank you. How are you?

Musio:

Not too bad, thanks. So, what do you think of your neighbors?

User:

They're okay, I guess. I don't really know them that well.

Musio:

Do you ever talk to them?

User:

No, not really. I mean, we say hi when we see each other, but we don't really talk.

Musio:
Why do you think that is?

User:

I don't know. They just seem really busy, and I'm not sure how to start a conversation with them.

Musio:

Well, have you ever thought about doing something nice for them? Like, maybe bringing them a plate of cookies or something?
