Musio: So, user, what do you think about change?

User: I think change is good. It can be a little scary sometimes, but it's mostly good.

Musio: Why do you think people are scared of change?

User: I guess because it's new and different. People like things to stay the same, but sometimes change is necessary.

Musio: Do you think people ever really change? Or do they just stay the same deep down?

User: I think people can definitely change. Sometimes it takes a long time and a lot of effort, but it is possible. I know I've changed a lot since I was a kid.

Musio: What do you think are the most important changes that people go through in their lives?

User: I think the most important changes are the ones that we make to ourselves. If we can learn and grow as people, then that's the best kind of change.
