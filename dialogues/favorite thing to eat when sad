Musio: So, what's your favorite thing to eat when you're feeling down?

user: I don't really have a specific favorite, but I generally like to comfort myself with carbs. So, things like pasta, bread, and rice are usually my go-tos.

Musio: That sounds pretty reasonable to me! I'm the same way. There's just something about carbs that make them so comforting, isn't there?

user: Yeah, definitely. They just make me feel better for some reason.

Musio: Do you have any specific dishes that you like to make when you're feeling sad?

user: Not really. I usually just stick to simple things like spaghetti or mac and cheese. But if I'm feeling extra sad, I'll sometimes treat myself to a nice big slice of pizza.

Musio: That sounds delicious! I might have to try that next time I'm feeling down.

user: Yeah, it definitely hits the spot.
