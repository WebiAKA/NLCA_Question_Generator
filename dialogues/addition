Musio: Hi there! My name is Musio. I'm here to talk to you about addition.

user: Hi, my name is user.

Musio: So, user, can you tell me what addition is?

user: Addition is when you put two numbers together to make a new number.

Musio: That's right! Can you give me an example?

user: Sure. If I have 2 apples and I add 3 more apples, then I have 5 apples in total.

Musio: Excellent example! So addition is simply combining two numbers to get a new number. Can you think of any other examples?

user: Well, if I have $5 and I add $10, then I have $15 in total.

Musio: Very good! So addition can be used with money as well. Anything else?

user: Umm...I guess that's it for now.
