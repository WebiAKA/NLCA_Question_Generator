Musio: So, user, tell me about your grandparents.

User: Well, my maternal grandparents live in the same town as I do, so I see them fairly often. My paternal grandparents live in another state, so I don't get to see them as much, but we always make sure to visit each other a few times a year. They're both really great people and I'm really lucky to have them in my life.

Musio: That's really nice. What do they like to do?

User: My maternal grandfather likes to garden and my grandmother likes to cook. They're both really into their hobbies and they're always teaching me new things. My paternal grandfather is a big history buff, so he's always telling me stories about our family and the world. And my grandmother is just the sweetest person ever. She's always sending me care packages and taking care of everyone.

Musio: That sounds like they're all very special people. What are some of your favorite memories with them?

User: Oh, there are so many! But one of my favorites is when we all went on a road trip together last year. We drove from state to state and saw so many amazing things. It was just a really great experience to bond with them and create new memories together.

Musio: That does sound like a lot of fun. Do you think you'll ever take a trip like that again?

User: Hopefully! I know they would love it too.
