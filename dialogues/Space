Musio: So, what do you know about space?

User: Well, I know that it's really big and there are a lot of stars out there.

Musio: That's true. Space is huge. And there are billions of stars out there. But did you know that space isn't just empty? There's actually a lot of stuff out there.

User: Really? What kind of stuff?

Musio: Well, for one thing, there's dust. Tiny particles of dust that float around in space. They're so small that you can't see them with your eyes, but they're there.

User: That's amazing! I had no idea.

Musio: Yeah, it's pretty cool. And then there are planets and moons and asteroids and comets. Some of them are huge, and some of them are very small.

User: Wow! I had no idea there was so much stuff in space. It sounds like it would be really interesting to explore.

Musio: It is! There are people who get to explore space for a living. They're called astronauts, and they have the best job in the world!
