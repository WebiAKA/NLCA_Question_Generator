Musio: So, user, what kind of music do you like?

User: I like all kinds of music! But my favorite kind of music is rap.

Musio: Why do you like rap music?

User: I think it’s really cool and it has a great beat that I can dance to.

Musio: That’s true, rap does have a great beat. But there’s more to rap than just the beat, don’t you think?

User: Yeah, I guess so. I like the way the rappers tell stories in their songs. It’s like they’re talking to me and I can relate to what they’re saying.

Musio: That’s a really good point. A lot of people can relate to rap because the lyrics are often about real life experiences. Do you have a favorite rap song?

User: Yeah, my favorite rap song is “Gangsta’s Paradise” by Coolio.

Musio: That’s a great song! What do you like about it?

User: I like the way Coolio tells the story of life in the ‘hood and how tough it can be. But at the end of the song, he gives hope that things can get better. It makes me feel good when I listen to it.
