Musio: So, what do you think about ethnicity?

User: Well, I think it's really important. It's a big part of who we are and where we come from.

Musio: That's true. Do you think there is anything wrong with being proud of your ethnicity?

User: No, I don't think there is anything wrong with it. I think it's natural to be proud of your ethnicity.

Musio: Some people might say that being too proud of your ethnicity can lead to discrimination against others. What do you think about that?

User: I don't think that's true. I think if you're proud of your ethnicity, it just means that you're proud of who you are. It doesn't mean that you're better than anyone else.
