Musio: So, what's your favorite thing to do while eating?
user: I really like to talk to the people I'm eating with. I think it's really important to connect with the people you're sharing a meal with.

Musio: That sounds great! I love connecting with people over food too. What kind of things do you like to talk about while you're eating?

user: Well, I usually like to ask people about their day or something that's going on in their life. I think it's a really good way to get to know someone.

Musio: That's definitely true! Food is such a great way to connect with people. Do you have any favorite foods that you like to eat while you're talking?

user: I love Chinese food, so anything that's a little spicy is always good for me. I also really like Italian food, so anything with pasta is usually a winner for me.

Musio: Those both sound delicious! I'm definitely going to have to try them sometime. So, do you think that talking while you're eating is more important than the actual food itself?

user: No, not at all! I think the food is just as important as the conversation. After all, what's a meal without good company and good food?
