Musio: So, user, what do you think about drawing?

User: Drawing is fun! I like to draw pictures of my friends and family.

Musio: That's great! What do you think makes a good drawing?

User: I think it's important to have lots of details in your drawings. That way, people can really see what you're trying to show them.

Musio: That's definitely true! What do you think is the most challenging part of drawing?

User: I think it can be hard to get the proportions right. Sometimes things can look really different in a drawing than they do in real life.

Musio: Yes, that can be tricky! But practice makes perfect, right?

User: Absolutely! The more you practice, the better you'll get at drawing.
