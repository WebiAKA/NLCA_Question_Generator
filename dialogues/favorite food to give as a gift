Musio: Do you have any tips on making the perfect chocolate chip cookie?

user: Yes! I always use butter instead of margarine, and I make sure to cream the butter and sugar together until it is light and fluffy. This helps create a more flavorful cookie. I also like to use dark chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate chips for a richer flavor. Finally, I always bake the cookies until they are just barely done, so they are nice and soft when you bite into them.
