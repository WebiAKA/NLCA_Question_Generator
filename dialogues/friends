Musio: So, what do you think about friends?

User: I think they're great! I have a lot of friends at school and we always have a lot of fun together.

Musio: That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you think it's important to have friends?

User: I think it's important to have at least one good friend. It's someone you can rely on and who will be there for you, no matter what.

Musio: That's definitely true. A friend can be a great support system. Do you think it's easy to make friends?

User: I think it can be easy or hard, depending on the person. Some people are really outgoing and make friends easily, while others are shy and might find it harder. But I think that if you just keep trying, eventually you'll find some friends that are right for you.
