Musio: So, what do you think a miracle is?

User: Well, I guess a miracle is something that's really amazing and that we can't explain.

Musio: Can you give me an example?

User: Well, I read about this one time where this guy was driving and he got into a really bad car accident. His car was totaled and he should have died, but he didn't. The doctors said it was a miracle.

Musio: Why do you think that was a miracle?

User: Well, I guess because it's just so amazing that he survived. I mean, it's almost like he shouldn't have been able to, but he did. So, I guess that's a miracle.

Musio: Do you think miracles happen often?

User: No, I don't think so. I mean, they're pretty rare. I think most people go their whole lives without ever seeing one.

Musio: What do you think causes a miracle to happen?

User: I don't really know. I guess maybe it's just God or fate or something. But whatever the reason is, I think it's pretty amazing when it does happen.
