Musio: So, user, how do you feel about seconds?

user: Well, they're not my favorite unit of time, but I guess they're okay.

Musio: Why aren't they your favorite?

user: I don't know, they just don't seem as exciting as other units of time like hours or days.

Musio: Do you think seconds are important?

user: Yeah, I guess they are. They're pretty short, so if something happens in a second it's over before you know it.

Musio: That's true. What do you think is the most exciting thing that can happen in a second?

user:Hmm, that's tough. I don't know if anything really exciting can happen in such a short amount of time. Maybe something like winning a race or catching a ball right before it hits the ground.

Musio: Those are both great examples! So you think seconds can be pretty important then?

user: Yeah, I guess they can be. Like I said, things can happen really fast in a second and you might not even realize it.
