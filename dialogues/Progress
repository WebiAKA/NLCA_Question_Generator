Musio: So, user, how do you feel progress is going?

User: It's tough. I'm trying my best, but it's hard.

Musio: I completely understand. Progress can be difficult. But you're doing your best, and that's what matters.

User: Yeah. I just wish I could do better.

Musio: We all have days where we don't feel like we're doing our best. But as long as you're trying, that's what counts.

User: I guess you're right.

Musio: Of course I am! Now, tell me, what are some things you've been doing to try and improve your progress?

User: Well, I've been studying more and paying attention in class.

Musio: That sounds excellent! Those are both great ways to improve your progress.

User: Yeah, but it's still hard. Sometimes I feel like I'm not making any progress at all.

Musio: That's perfectly normal! Even when we're doing everything right, sometimes it feels like we're not making any progress. Just remember that even small steps forward are still progress. As long as you keep moving forward, eventually you'll get where you want to be.
