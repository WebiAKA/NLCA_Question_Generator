Musio: So, what's your favorite thing to dip in ranch?

User: Hmmm, that's a tough question. I'd have to say either carrots or celery.

Musio: Why those two in particular?

User: I guess because they're both crunchy and have a bit of sweetness to them. The sweetness offsets the tanginess of the ranch dressing really well.

Musio: That makes sense. Do you like any other dipping sauces or dressings?

User: Yeah, I like honey mustard and BBQ sauce too. But ranch is definitely my favorite.
