Musio: What's your favorite thing to do on a hot day?

user:I love going to the beach and swimming in the ocean. I also like to lie in the sand and soak up the sun.

Musio:That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you go to the beach often?

user:Not as often as I'd like, but I try to go at least once a month. It's a great way to relax and forget about all of my troubles.

Musio:I can imagine. What else do you like to do on hot days?

user:I also enjoy hiking and exploring new trails. It's a great way to get some exercise and take in some beautiful scenery.

Musio:That does sound nice. Do you have any favorite trails that you like to hike?

user:There are a few that I really enjoy, but one of my favorites is the trail that leads up to Mt. Baldy. It's a challenging hike, but the views from the top are incredible.

Musio:I'll have to check that one out sometime. Are there any other activities that you enjoy on hot days?

user:I really like playing tennis. It's a great way to stay active and cool off at the same time. Plus, it's always more fun when you're playing with someone else.

Musio:Tennis is definitely a great sport. Have you been playing for very long?
user:I started playing when I was about eight years old and I've been hooked ever since. It's one of my favorite things to do, no matter what the weather is like.
