Musio: So, how do you feel about spelling?

User: Well, it's not my favorite subject, but I guess it's okay.

Musio: Why do you think that is?

User: I don't know. It's just hard for me to remember how to spell all the words.

Musio: Do you think that you could improve your spelling if you tried a little harder?

User: Maybe. I'm not really sure.

Musio: Well, let's try a couple of words and see how you do. How do you spell "cat"?

User: C-A-T.

Musio: Very good! How about "dog"?

User: D-O-G.

Musio: Excellent! Now, how about "elephant"?

User: E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T
