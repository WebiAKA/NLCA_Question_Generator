Musio: Hello, user. I'm Musio, and I'm here to talk with you about service. First, can you tell me what service is?

user:

Sure. Service is when you help other people without expecting anything in return. It's about giving of yourself to make someone else's life better.

Musio:

That's a great definition. Can you give me an example of service?

user:

Well, one time I helped my mom carry groceries into the house. She was really tired and I could tell she needed some help. So I offered to carry some of the bags for her. That made her really happy and it made me feel good too.

Musio:

That sounds like a great example of service. Did you do it because you wanted to help your mom or because you wanted something in return?

user:

I just wanted to help her out. I didn't expect anything in return. But it feels really good to help someone else, even if you don't get anything in return.
