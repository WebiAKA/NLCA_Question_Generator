Musio: So, checks. What do you know about them?

User:

Well, I know that you write them out when you want to pay for something. You put the amount you want to pay in the little box, and then you sign your name at the bottom.

Musio:

That's right. Checks are a way to pay for things without using cash. So, what else do you know about them?

User:

Um...I know that you can get checks from the bank, and that you can use them to pay your bills.

Musio:

That's correct. You can get blank checks from your bank, or you can order personalized checks with your name and address on them. And you can use checks to pay almost any kind of bill - your rent, your utilities, your credit card bill, and so on.

I've never written a check before. How do you do it?

Musio: Well, it's not difficult. You just need to fill out the check properly. First, you'll need to write the date in the top right-hand corner. Then, on the line next to 'Pay to the order of,' you'll need to write the name of the person or company you're paying. After that, you'll need to write out the amount of money you're paying in words (for example, 'twenty-three dollars and 45/100'). Finally, on the line at the bottom where it says 'Signature,' you'll need to sign your name. Once you've done all that, the check is ready to be mailed or deposited.
