Musio: So, user, what do you think is the most important thing to know about nutrition?

user: I think the most important thing to know about nutrition is that it’s important to eat a variety of foods.

Musio: Why is that?

user: Well, I guess because if you only eat one kind of food, you might not get all the nutrients your body needs.

Musio: That’s a good point. What are some other things people should know about nutrition?

user: Well, I think people should know that they need to eat healthy foods, and not too much of any one thing. And they should exercise too, because that’s important for being healthy.

Musio: That’s definitely true! Nutrition and exercise are both key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Are there any other things you think people should know about nutrition?

user: I don’t really know…I guess just that it’s important to pay attention to what you eat and how much you eat, so that you can be sure you’re getting the nutrients your body needs.
