Musio: So, what's your favorite card game?

User: I absolutely love playing Go Fish!

Musio: Why is that?

User: I don't know, it's just really fun. I like trying to collect all the sets of cards.

Musio: That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you always win?

User: No, sometimes my sister wins. But it's okay, because then I get to be the winner next time.

Musio: That's a great attitude. I'm sure you'll be winning a lot more in the future. Thanks for chatting with me today!
