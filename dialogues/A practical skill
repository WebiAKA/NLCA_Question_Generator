Musio: So, user, tell me about a practical skill you have.

User: Well, I'm pretty good at using Excel. I can do things like make formulas and charts and stuff.

Musio: That's great! What made you learn how to use Excel?

User: I took a class on it in college. And then I used it a lot at my old job.

Musio: Do you think Excel is a valuable skill to have?

User: Yeah, I do. I think it's really helpful in a lot of different contexts. For example, at my old job, we would use Excel to track our sales numbers. And then we would use the charts and formulas to figure out where we needed to improve.

Musio: That makes sense. Do you think Excel is something that people should learn how to use?

User: Absolutely. I think it's a really useful tool, especially for people who work with data or numbers in some way.
