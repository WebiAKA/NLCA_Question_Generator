Musio: So, user, what do you think about recycling?

User: I think recycling is important because it helps the environment.

Musio: Why do you think it’s important to recycle?

User: Well, when we recycle, we’re actually reusing materials instead of just throwing them away. And that means we’re not using up new resources to make things. We’re also reducing pollution because recycled materials often require less energy to process than new materials.

Musio: That’s a great point! Do you have any idea how much pollution is reduced when we recycle?

User: Well, I’ve read that recycling one ton of aluminum cans saves the energy equivalent of running a 100-watt light bulb for more than 20 hours, or a car for three weeks!

Musio: Wow, that’s a lot of energy! Are there other benefits to recycling besides reducing pollution?

User: Yes, recycling can also help save money. For example, if everyone in the United States recycled just half of their newspapers, we could save about $1 billion each year!

Musio: That’s a lot of money! What do you think is the best way to recycle?

User: I think the best way to recycle is to reduce our consumption first. Then we can reuse items instead of throwing them away, and finally recycle what can’t be reused.
