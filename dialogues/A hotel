Musio: Hi, welcome to our hotel. How may I help you?

User: Hi! I'm looking for a place to stay for a few days.

Musio: We have plenty of rooms available. What is your budget?

User: Well, I'm not really sure. What are your rates?

Musio: Our rates start at $50 per night.

User: Hmm, that's a little more than I wanted to spend. Do you have any discounts or specials?

Musio: We do have some discounts available. Are you a member of AAA or AARP?

User: No, I'm not.

Musio: Well, we do offer a 10% discount for AAA and AARP members. We also offer a 5% discount for military personnel.

User: I'm not military, but the 10% discount sounds good. I'll take a room for two nights.

Musio: Great! We'll need your credit card information to hold the room.
