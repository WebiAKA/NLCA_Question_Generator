Musio: Hi there, can I ask you some questions about numbers?

User: Hi! Sure, go ahead.

Musio: Great! So, what's your favorite number?

User:Hmm, that's a tough question. I like a lot of numbers for different reasons. But if I had to choose just one, I think my favorite number would be 7.

Musio: Interesting! Why do you like 7?

User: Well, it's a lucky number for one thing. And it's also a prime number, which I think is pretty cool. Plus, it's the number of days in a week, so it's always in my head!

Musio: That makes sense! Do you have any other favorite numbers?

User:I like 9 too because it's another prime number and it's also the highest single digit number. And I really like 10 because it's such a round, nice looking number. Oh, and 100 is pretty great too because it has so many zeros!

Musio: Ha, yeah 100 is a cool number. Do you have any least favorite numbers?

User:Not really, but I guess if I had to choose one it would be 13. It's just an unlucky number in a lot of cultures and I don't like that about it. Other than that though, I don't really dislike any numbers.

Musio: That's good to hear! Well thank you for your time, user. It was great talking to you about numbers!
