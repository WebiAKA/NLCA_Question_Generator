Musio: So, user, what do you think about bills?

User: Well, I think they're important. I mean, without them we wouldn't have any money to buy things we need.

Musio: That's true. But some people don't like bills because they have to pay them. What do you think about that?

User: I can see why they wouldn't like it, but I think it's important to pay our bills. Otherwise we might get into debt and that would be even worse.

Musio: Do you have any experience with paying bills?

User: Yeah, my family pays bills every month. My mom usually does it, but sometimes my dad does it too.

Musio: What kind of bills do you have to pay?

User: We have to pay for our house, our car, our phone, and all sorts of other things. It can be a lot of money sometimes, but we always make sure to pay our bills on time.

Musio: That's good. It's important to be responsible when it comes to money. So, user, in your opinion, what's the most important thing about bills?

User: I think the most important thing is to make sure you pay them on time. If you don't, you could end up in a lot of trouble.
