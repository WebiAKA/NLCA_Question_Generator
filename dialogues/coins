Musio: So, user, what can you tell me about coins?

User:

Well, they're small metal discs that are used as currency. They come in different denominations, and you can use them to buy things.

Musio:

That's right. Coins are a type of currency. Do you know where the first coins came from?

User:

I'm not sure. I think they might have originated in China or something?

Musio:

Actually, the first coins were minted in Lydia, which is now part of Turkey. They were made of gold and silver, and they had images of animals on them. Can you guess why they put animals on the coins?

User:

I'm not sure. Maybe because people liked looking at animals? Or maybe it was a way of showing what the value of the coin was? Like, if it had a picture of a sheep on it, that could mean it was worth one sheep or something.

Musio:

That's actually a really good guess! A lot of times, the images on coins were meant to show what the coin was worth. So if there was an image of a sheep on a Lydia coin, that could mean that the coin was worth one sheep. In ancient Greece, they had coins with images of gods and goddesses on them, to show how valuable they thought those deities were.

But sometimes the images on coins were just for decoration, like in medieval Europe when they would put pictures of kings and queens on coins.

Did you know that some countries have stopped using coins altogether? For example, Canada is phasing out its one cent coins because they're not worth very much anymore.
