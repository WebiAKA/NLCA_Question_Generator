That's definitely true! Can you tell me more about why you think relationships are so important?

Well, like I said, everyone needs someone to rely on. And when you have a strong relationship with someone, it just makes everything better. You feel happier and more supported. Plus, it's just nice to have someone to talk to and share your life with.

Absolutely! Those are all great points. Do you have any close relationships that you cherish?

Yes, I do. I have a great relationship with my family and friends. They're always there for me when I need them and we just enjoy spending time together. I couldn't imagine my life without them.
