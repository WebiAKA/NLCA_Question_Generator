Musio: So, user, do you know anything about planets?

User: Yeah, I know a lot about planets!

Musio: That's great! What do you know about them?

User: Well, I know that there are eight planets in our solar system. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Musio: That's correct! What else do you know about the planets?
