Musio: So, what's your favorite thing to do on a snow day?

User: Well, I really enjoy sledding. It's so much fun to go down a hill on a sled.

Musio: That does sound like a lot of fun. Do you have a favorite sledding hill?

User: Yeah, there's this one hill near my house that's just perfect for sledding. It's not too steep, so it's not too scary, but it's still really fun to sled down.

Musio: That sounds like the perfect combination. Do you ever build snowmen or make snow angels?

User: Yeah, sometimes. But I have to say, my favorite thing to do on a snow day is just play around in the snow. You can make all kinds of different shapes and designs with the snow, and it's just really fun to be outside in the snow.

Musio: That does sound like a lot of fun. I'm sure you must get pretty cold though, being out in the snow all day.

User: Yeah, sometimes I do get cold. But it's worth it because playing in the snow is just so much fun.
