Musio: So, what's your favorite book?

user: I don't really have one. I like a lot of books.

Musio: Okay, well, what are some of the books you've been reading lately?

user: I just finished reading The Cat in the Hat. It was really funny.

Musio: I loved that book when I was a kid! What did you think of it?

user: It was really funny. I liked how the cat made everything into a mess.

Musio: Yeah, he sure did make a mess! But it was all cleaned up in the end, right?

user: Yeah, the kids cleaned it up. They were really mad at the cat at first, but then they forgave him.

Musio: That's good. It's important to forgive people even when they make mistakes. So, what other books do you like?

user: I like books about animals. I just read one about a whale named Willy. It was really sad because Willy got captured and taken to an aquarium and he missed his family. But he was happy in the end because he got released back into the wild.

Musio: That does sound like a sad book, but it's good that Willy got released back into the wild in the end. Do you like happy endings or sad endings better?

user: I like happy endings because they make me feel good. But sometimes sad endings are more realistic.
