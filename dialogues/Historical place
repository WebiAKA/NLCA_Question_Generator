Musio: So, user, can you tell me about a historical place that you would like to visit?

user: I would love to visit the ancient city of Pompeii in Italy.

Musio: Really? What do you know about Pompeii?

user: It was a city that was destroyed by a volcano eruption in 79 AD. I think it would be really interesting to see the ruins of the city and imagine what life was like there.

Musio: That sounds like a great idea! Do you know how far Pompeii is from Rome?

user: It's about 24 miles southwest of Rome.

Musio: That's not too far. Have you ever been to Rome before?

user: No, I haven't. But I've always wanted to go. I hear it's a beautiful city.

Musio: It is. I'm sure you'll enjoy it if you ever get the chance to go. Thanks for talking with me about Pompeii.
