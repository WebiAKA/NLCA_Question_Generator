Musio: So, user, can you tell me about the months of the year?

User: Well, there are twelve of them, and they each have their own special characteristics. January is the first month, and it's pretty cold. February is the month of love, because of Valentine's Day. March is when spring starts, and April is when the flowers start blooming. May is a nice month, because it's not too hot or too cold. June is when summer starts, and July is when everyone goes on vacation. August is when the weather starts to get a little bit cooler. September is when the leaves start to change color. October is when Halloween happens. November is when Thanksgiving happens. And December is when Christmas happens.

Musio: Wow, that was a lot of information! Do you have a favorite month?

User: I think my favorite month is October, because I love Halloween. But I also like December because it's so festive.
