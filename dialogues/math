Musio: Hi there! My name is Musio and I'm here to talk to you about math.

User:

Hi! My name is user and I am a second grade English language student. I don't know much about math, but I'm willing to learn.

Musio:

That's great! I'm always happy to help people learn more about math. Let's start with some basics. Do you know what addition and subtraction are?

User:

Yes, I do. Addition is when you put two numbers together and subtraction is when you take one number away from another.

Musio:

That's right! Can you give me an example of each?

User:

Sure. For addition, if I have two apples and three oranges, then I have five fruits in total. For subtraction, if I have seven pieces of candy and eat three, then I have four pieces left.
