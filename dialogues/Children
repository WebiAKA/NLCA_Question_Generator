Musio: So, user, do you have any siblings?

user: Yes, I have a younger sister.

Musio: What's she like?

user: She's really sweet and always laughing. She loves to play with her toys and swing on the swings at the park. She's a lot of fun.

Musio: Do you enjoy spending time with her?

user: Yes, I do. Even though she can be frustrating sometimes, I still love her and enjoy spending time with her.

Musio: What are some of the things you like to do together?

user: We like to play tag, ride our bikes together, and just generally run around and have fun. We also like to read stories together and color. Sometimes we'll even build forts out of blankets and pillows. It's always fun.

Musio: It sounds like you two have a great time together. How long have you been close?

user: We've always been pretty close because we're only two years apart in age. But I'd say we've gotten even closer over the past year or so.

Musio: That's really nice. I'm sure she looks up to you as a big sister. Do you try to be a good role model for her?

user: Yes, I definitely try to be a good role model for her. I want her to be able to look up to me and know that I'm always there for her, no matter what happens.
