Musio: What's your favorite kind of music, User?

User:

I like all kinds of music, but I really enjoy listening to rap and hip hop.

Musio:

That's great! What are some of your favorite rap and hip hop artists?

User:

I really like Lil Wayne and Drake. They're both really talented rappers.

Musio:

I completely agree! What do you think makes them so successful?

User:

I think it has a lot to do with their lyrics. They're both really good at telling stories and painting pictures with their words. And they're also both really good at delivering their lines with a lot of energy and emotion. That's what I think makes them stand out from other rappers.
