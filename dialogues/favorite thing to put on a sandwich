Musio: So, what's your favorite thing to put on a sandwich?

user: I really like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I think they're really tasty and they're really easy to make.

Musio: Yeah, PB&J sandwiches are pretty popular. What kind of peanut butter do you like to use?

user: I usually use creamy peanut butter, but sometimes I'll use chunky if I'm feeling like it.

Musio: And what kind of jelly do you like?

user: I like grape jelly the best, but I'll also eat strawberry or raspberry jelly.

Musio: That sounds really good. I might have to try that sometime. Do you put anything else on your PB&J sandwiches?

user: Sometimes I'll put a little bit of honey on them, or if I'm feeling really hungry, I'll add some bacon.

Musio: Wow, that sounds delicious! I might have to try that too. Thanks for sharing your favorite sandwich with me.
