Predicting crime rates from socioeconomic variables is an application of predictive modeling using binary data. The author asks about the impact of autocorrelated residuals on the model, and also whether there is difficulty in using longitudinal data. One problem with multi-decade panel data that could negatively impact the model is that it's unclear how to take into account id (individual) and time (year) dimensions.
