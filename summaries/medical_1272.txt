A patient with obstructive symptoms and adenotonsillitis underwent a general endotracheal anesthesia for an adenotonsillectomy. The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery. The tonsil was removed from the superior and inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in the subcapsular fashion. The right tonsil was grasped in the similar fashion and retracted medially and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery. The tonsil was removed from the superior pole and inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in the subcapsular fashion. Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed to contain any additional bleeding. There were no intraoperative complications.
