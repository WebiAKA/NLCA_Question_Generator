Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, 31, told Aftenposten Daily he hoped to return next season following a career-threatening injury to his right knee. The Norway international underwent surgery in Sweden in August to transplant cartilage into the joint and is slavishly following a programme as it should be going with the knee. Solskjaer last played for United against Millwall on May 21 in the FA Cup final as a late substitute. His contract with United runs out in 2006, by which time he will have been at the Premier League club for 10 years.
