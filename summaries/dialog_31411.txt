In the first paragraph, an unnamed person who was introduced earlier in the text talks to James Leer and asks him about his family. He tells her that he is a scandal because his father died of colon cancer while working at a mannequin factory. In the third paragraph, someone stole Grady's car and hit it with their butt, so Grady got James Leer to stand on a box to look out of the window and see if Emily is home. He gets distracted by memories and then tells Grady that Emily might not be home because she rarely carries keys since being 12 years old. She lives in Kinship, which looks like "where Andy Hardy would live." James suggests that Grady should come back after smoking the rest of the joint he had been smoking because he felt good there. He eventually agrees to help them break into Emily's house.
