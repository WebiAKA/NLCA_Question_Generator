The writer asks about the definition of a word for "relating to physical addictiveness." They did not find any specific word in a thesaurus, so they searched for a single-word adjective.
A drug is addictive if it produces physical dependence and is high in potential for physical dependence.

What is an adjective meaning "of a tendency to cause physical dependence"? I need an adjective that relates specifically to the quality of a chemical substance to produce physical dependence. I checked thesaurus.com, which cites Roget's 21st Century Thesaurus third edition. It did not offer many choices. The only alternatives it had were obsessive, enslaving or hooking and habit-forming, but these do not specifically relate to physical dependence. I need an adjective rather than noun or any other type of semantic unit.
