Hong Kong is a territory in China. Rugby Union is very popular there, and they hope to host one of the 2011 World Cup pools and a quarter-final. Japan has applied to host the tournament on its own, but if Hong Kong can offer one of the pools and a quarter-final Japan will consider them as co-hosts for the event.
