User: What would you like to know about the planets?

Musio: I want to know about the temperature and climate of Earth.

User: Right now, the temperature of Earth is pretty much a nice 70 degrees Fahrenheit because it's summertime! But during wintertime, it can get really cold with temperatures reaching below zero degrees. And although that might sound really cold, some people actually love to ski on ice and snow.

Musio: Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun! Thank you for telling me all about Earth!
