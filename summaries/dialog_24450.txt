In this passage, Neils asks Etta three questions about the Miyamoto family's purchase of her property. The first question is what she had originally sold the property for. Her answer is $4500. The second question is what Ole Jurgensen had paid her per acre. She answers $1000. Neils then calculates that if the Miyamotos would have paid off their balance in full, they would have owed Etta $7000 for the sale of her property, but instead they only ended up owing her $2500 because they defaulted on payments. Neils' third question to Etta is if she still has an equity of $2500 from this transaction. Etta says she does and Neils doesn't ask any more questions about it after this.
