England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has decided to start Shaun Wright-Phillips against the Netherlands. Wright-Phillips will not make his first start for England on the left side of the field, as had been widely expected. Wes Brown will start alongside Jamie Carragher in the injury-hit center of defense and the other new players in the squad, Andy Johnson and Stewart Downing will also get a chance to impress.
