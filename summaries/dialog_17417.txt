The protagonist, D. B., talks to his aide, Connell, about the costs of the John Doe movement and how much money they will need for the convention coming up. Connell seems lost, and doesn't understand what he's asking. D. B. informs him that he is a sucker if he can't make four out of two and two together and asks where he comes in himself since D. B is supposed to know his way around so well. The question confuses Connell even more; D. B.'s understanding makes no sense to him, though they're both trying to be sly about it in front of one another.
