Musio: Let's start by talking about the basics, like what some shapes are. What do you know about circles?

User: Circles are perfectly round shapes that have exactly the same measurements along each diameter.

Musio: That's right! So, for example, a circle can be found at the bottom of a drinking glass or on your wristwatch. Can you think of any other examples?

User: Round pizza and flat bread are also good examples of circles. 
User: They're pretty common in food.

Musio: Good job! We should talk about how to measure things like length and area. What does this look like for a square?

User: Well, for a square we need to measure the diagonal line from one corner to another and then multiply that number by itself. This will give us the length and width both equal to half of that number with our side lengths being equal to twice that number. For an area, we would take these numbers and multiply them together, giving us an area equal to 4 times our length squared with our side lengths being equal to 8 times that number squared too! Pretty easy once you get it down!
