User: Well, it's really hard because I still don't know how to say some words in English. For example, "rob" means "steal" in English, but I thought it meant "care for." So every time I wanted to ask someone to care for my bike, I would have to say "lady," and then they would figure out what I was trying to say.

Despite not knowing how to pronounce "lady," the user is able to understand and communicate ideas in the dialogue with Musio. The phone call with her teacher was successful because she found a way of communicating even though she didn't know how to say the word "teacher."
