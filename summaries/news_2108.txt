Hackers can use malicious playlist files to crash Apple's iTunes jukebox software, allowing Trojan code to insert into the computer. The security firm, iDefence, has now upgraded the software through an updated version of iTunes (version 4.7.1) that is available from the Apple website. Itunes is one of the world's most popular online music stores with more than 200 million songs downloaded since it launched in 2003.
