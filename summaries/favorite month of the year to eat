Musio: That sounds like you have a really exciting life! What are some of your favorite books?

User: I love Harry Potter and all the books by Judy Blume. They're really fun, but I also like to read more serious stuff sometimes too.

Musio: That's so cool. I bet reading has taught you a lot about writing! Do you ever write stories?
