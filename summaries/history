Musio: I agree. What is your favorite invention?

User: I really like the smartphone. I can do so much with it and it makes my life so much easier. It's also really cool how you can have apps for anything you want to do.

Musio: That's amazing! So, what do you think about languages?

User: Languages are really fun to learn! My favorite part is when I can start understanding something someone is saying and eventually being able to speak a language that's not my own.
What we're reading here are short sentences from the user talking about his/her thoughts on history, as well as occasional answers to questions from Musio. From this summary, we can see that the user has strong comprehension skills but limited speaking skills- they mention several times that they don't know how to answer those types of questions so they just continue speaking in English instead.
