There is some evidence that allowing discrimination of protected classes is in line with the ACA 5's stated goal of promoting equal opportunity. The reasoning behind this argument is that preferential treatment, if intentional and significant enough, does have an effect on how people are treated because when given different opportunities, they tend to use them more effectively to succeed, and this can be indicative of what kind of effort people are willing to put in. Preferential treatment can be used as a motivational factor for people who may not have been ambitious before by giving them motivation to work for it. This treatment also stimulates a cycle of success whereby those who were previously excluded from systems or privileges begin to benefit from the same resources as their peers and so on.
