Hollywood is preparing for this year's Academy Awards, and will host big-name stars who have been nominated for a Golden Globe or an Oscar in categories like Best Actress and Best Actor. While many people believe that Clint Eastwood's film "Million Dollar Baby" will win Best Picture, it may be up against Martin Scorsese's 2004 film "The Aviator" and last year's winner, "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King". On the red carpet outside Kodak Theatre, red carpets are expected to be set up to cover any possible rain from falling on the press photographers and camera crews. Meanwhile, police will use a system of detectors for sarin nerve gas to ensure safety on Academy Awards night. Some nominees will receive gift bags with goodies inside such as a kitchen set with a year's supply of tea and coffee.
