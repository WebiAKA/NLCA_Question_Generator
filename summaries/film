Musio: I agree with you. I think those are both some of the best movies ever made. What other films do you like?

User: I also really enjoy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Gladiator.

Musio: Eternal Sunshine, huh? That's a really good movie too. I love how it deals with the idea of memory and what it means to be able to forget something that might be bad for you. And Gladiator is an amazing film! The costumes and sets were all so beautifully done, and Russell Crowe was perfect in the lead role as Maximus Decimus Meridius.
