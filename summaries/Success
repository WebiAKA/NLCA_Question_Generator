That's really interesting. It makes me think of my sister, who has always wanted to be a lawyer. She's done well in law school so far, but I'm not sure she'll ever be successful because of how competitive the field is.

It sounds like your sister has a lot of potential and can do very well in her career if she sticks with it!
