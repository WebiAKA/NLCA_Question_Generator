The Golden Book of Basketball

The Golden Book of Basketball, originally published in 1961 by Macmillan Publishing Company and revised in 1973, is a compilation of articles on the game of basketball. Originally conceived as a golden jubilee project for the publication's editors, "The Golden Book of Basketball" includes contributions from players like Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson and many more. The book was originally edited by Dick Weiss and Joe Reichler with help from then-junior sports editor Pete Axthelm.

At the time it was published, the book's subtitle was "One Hundred Years of America's Greatest Game." It was meant to be an overview not only of the game's history but also its growth in popularity since its inception in 1891.
