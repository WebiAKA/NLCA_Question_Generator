Narcissus is a general who just won an impossible fight, yet he seems more focused on whether he was killed or not. Proximo, one of the prisoners from the fight, offers Narcissus fame and fortune if he will take his name to Rome with him, but Narcissus says he doesn't have anything to show for it. Nearby they hear their fellow fighter Brute bragging about how great a fighter he is, which makes Narcissus feel inferior. Cos, a scribe from the Daily Action newspaper arrives to offer the General fame and fortune in exchange for information on himself.
