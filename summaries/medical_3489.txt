The patient is a pleasant 48-year-old female with an approximately 24-hour history of right lower quadrant pain, which she describes as being stabbed with a knife, radiating around her side to her right flank. She states that it is particularly bad when up and walking around, goes away when she is lying down. She has no nausea or vomiting, no dysuria, no fever or chills, though she said she did feel warm. She states that she feels a bit like she did when she had her gallbladder removed nine years ago. Additionally, I should note that the patient is currently premenopausal with irregular menses, going anywhere from one to two months between cycles. She has no abnormal vaginal discharge, and she is sexually active.
