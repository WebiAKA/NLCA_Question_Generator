A question about why Aragorn could not be granted immortality is presented. There are precedents for this--families in which one member is immortal and the other human--and Aragorn's descendants are part of those families. Additionally, there was a person who was counted among the Eldar after marrying an Elf, and Aragorn should have been able to do so as well.
