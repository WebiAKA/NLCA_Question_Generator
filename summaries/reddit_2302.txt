In the passage, the speaker discusses how their family is too wealthy to qualify for need-based aid, but not wealthy enough to afford the expensive tuition at college. The speaker hopes they can attend Wellesley, but they are uncertain since that does not do merit or need-based scholarships. The other schools the speaker mentioned all have expensive tuition and minimal scholarships, so they hope they will be able to find a way to go to college without debt.
