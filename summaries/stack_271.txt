As of macOS Mojave, Dictionary.app requires users to download definitions from the internet. If you want a copy of these definitions for offline use, then there are two ways to achieve this. The first is to download the .pkg file while it's available on Apple's servers (assuming that this is how the downloads are distributed). The second is by copying and pasting the .dictionary files into your /System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices folder on a new machine. For some reason, neither will work when you move them back to your Mac.
