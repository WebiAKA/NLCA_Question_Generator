Continental airlines has filed a statement that they may run out of cash unless it reduces its wage and benefit costs by $500m by the end of February. Continental also said that, if it did not make any cuts, it expects to lose "hundreds of millions of dollars" in 2005 in current market conditions. This is a huge problem for the airline as its debt and pension payments are close to $984m this year and without cuts, the company would be in a desperate position.
