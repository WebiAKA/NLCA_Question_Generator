Oliver is in a discussion with General, who has just come into the room. They discuss leaving, and the General informs Oliver he will not be going because of the risk of carrying the plague. They are then joined by Cathy, and they comment on how strange it would be if Dr. Drossos tells them they are right to stay. Oliver continues to argue about staying, but General says at that point it would be too late to do anything else but wait for any necessary instructions from Dr. Drossos. The others remind him of his duty to the army, which he says there is no point in doing if he is as contagious as she appears to think him.
