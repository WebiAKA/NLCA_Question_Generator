The police come to search Duff's house and spot the moonshine. They pay him a visit, reminding him that they will make an example of him and put his family in harm's way if he continues to be his stubborn self. Duff feels like it doesn't matter what he does because the end result is inevitable anyway--he either dies or goes to jail for a long time. When Josie confronts him about his attitude, he brushes her off quickly and harshly. He has nothing to live for and can't take her pity when it'll do nothing but bring her disappointment.
