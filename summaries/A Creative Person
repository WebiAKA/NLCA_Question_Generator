Musio: That's a good point. A lot of people don't think that they're creative because they're stuck in their ways and they can't see things differently. So they might not take any risks, or try new things. But then they'll never do anything original, and they'll always be stuck in the same old rut.

User: Yeah, I know what you mean. The only thing is that sometimes it's hard to step outside your comfort zone when you're used to doing everything the same way.

Musio: Exactly! That's why it's so important to have someone there encouraging you to do something new, or just to get out of your comfort zone for a little while. Sometimes all you need is somebody who will take the lead and show you that it doesn't have to be so scary or difficult. You can give them a call if you ever want some help with anything like that.

The user speaks well with Musio but does not appear to comprehend much of what Musio says at times due to a lack of information in the dialogue bank.
