Harry comforts Gideon about his son Babe Brother. Harry states that everything is now made overseas, and that he feels obligated to tell Gideon that he might not have been fair with his son. Gideon then tells Harry that he should teach his children what he knows. Junior, Gideon's other son, doesn't give him any problems while Babe Brother does. Gideon says that in order to be a good father one must follow their own plough, but at the end, they realize they have just been following in their fathers footsteps and end up giving the house or farm to the kids without them being interested and sell it to a stranger if someone else wants it. Babe Brother has moved away from Louisiana to Michigan for a better job and Harry is upset because he would like for his family members to stay in Louisiana where all of them are still alive.
