James Blish's "Cities in Flight" series has a war between Earth colonists and the Vegan Confederation. The Vegans come from Vega, but in this series, it is unclear if they have only one home planet or two. It's unknown which planet was the home world of the Vegans because it is not clear which "Cities in Flight" planet is named as Vega II.
