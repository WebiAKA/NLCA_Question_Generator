A new virus, disguised as a joke, is spreading rapidly across the net. The Windows-based virus gathers email addresses from Microsoft Outlook and uses its own mail sending software to spread itself to new victims. When it infects a machine, the Bagle variant turns off security measures that usually protect PCs. As well as plundering Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses to send itself to, Bagle.AT also tries to turn off the firewall and security centre services on Windows XP machines.

This passage is about the newest form of the Joke-e-mail virus which is designed in such a way that when you open an attachment, it steals your email address and spreads itself to other PCs you may have connected with before opening the attachment.
