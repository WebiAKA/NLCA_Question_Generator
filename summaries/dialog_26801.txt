In an exchange with the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, Steve asks Furtwängler about a list of names of musicians who left Germany in 1933. Furtwängler responds that they were Jews and had to leave; moreover, he could not leave his homeland when she was suffering in her deepest misery. Steve says "See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!"
