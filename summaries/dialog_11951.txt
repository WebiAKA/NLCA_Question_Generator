Holly and Hannah are on their way to Daisy's school for a meeting with the headmaster. Holly cannot believe how much she despises the headmaster, as he reminds her of Ichabod Crane and his Adam's apple bobs up and down as if he is excited. When Hannah informs her that he is in fact not a loser, but in fact the headmaster of the school she says it is perfect because he has a good job and also isn't a dope addict like her ex-husband.
