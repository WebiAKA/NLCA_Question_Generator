Musio: Great. That gives me an idea of what you're looking for in your papers. I can help you find specific information like that. What are some other things that you like to do?

User: When I'm not writing, I like to read and explore new places. Sometimes I'll just go on a walk or take the bus down to my favorite coffee shop to relax.

Musio: Those are good ideas too! Where is your favorite place to visit?

User: I love visiting the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. They have different exhibits all the time, and it's a lot of fun exploring those. It's exciting too because sometimes the artists are there and available for interviews.
