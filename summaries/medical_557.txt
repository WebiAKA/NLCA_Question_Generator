A 51-year-old female with complaints of soft tissue mass over the dorsum of the right foot was diagnosed with a soft tissue mass and had previous injections to the site which have caused the mass to decrease in size. The patient has requested surgical intervention at this time. With an IV instituted by Department of Anesthesia, she was escorted from preoperative holding area to operating room and placed supine on operating room table. Local anesthesia was given using lidocaine, Marcaine, and Solu-Medrol. The patient's right foot was then elevated and exsanguinated with Esmarch bandage under 250 mmHg pressure. After adequate amount of anesthesia, she was given a curvilinear incision over the dorsum of her foot. Then, using sharp dissection combined with blunt dissection, she identified tendon, muscle belly of extensor digitorum brevis muscle as well as medial dorsal cutaneous nerve that were all found intact following surgery. Next attention
