A previously noted UTI patient presents for a followup. The patient had taken one nighttime dose of Macrodantin before stopping the medication due to an allergy to it, which has resolved. So far, there is no other dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, or chills present. However, there is daytime frequency with nocturia that is improving stress urinary incontinence since pelvic rehabilitation. There were two E coli urine cultures in 2007 and three in 2008 but all have been negative for infection. A catheterized urine specimen was obtained and will be sent to a lab for testing for both bacteria and sensitivity. The plan is to call the patient Monday for results if they do not show infection; otherwise, more information will need to be collected as the next step.
