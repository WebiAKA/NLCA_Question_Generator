A 52-year-old right-handed female has been healthy until January 1991 when she had a generalized tonic-clonic type seizure. She was diagnosed with a GBM on her right frontal lobe and underwent various treatments, ending with surgery to remove the mass. Doctors could not find any tumor recurrence following the procedure but noticed in March 1993 that the patient's weakness was worsening.
