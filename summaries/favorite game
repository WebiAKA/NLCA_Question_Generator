Musio: Me too! What's your favorite team?

User: The Los Angeles Dodgers. They're my favorite baseball team.

I think the user speaks English reasonably well, but there is some definite grammatical errors in this conversation. Also, the user does not seem to understand all the words that are being said to them and they end up responding with a "yes" or "no" because they don't know what else to say.
