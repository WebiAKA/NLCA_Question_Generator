Laparoscopic surgery is typically used to remove the gallbladder, which is a small organ that lies under the liver. The patient must be anesthetized before entering the operating room, as they are awake and conscious while the surgery occurs. A midline incision was made to enter into the abdomen. Carbon dioxide gas was pumped in at 16mmHg pressure and then three other trocars were placed with care taken when placing them. Then an attempt at performing an intraoperative cholangiogram for diagnostic purposes was attempted, but when this did not work it was abandoned, and instead the gallbladder was removed.
