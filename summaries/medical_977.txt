This passage discusses the problem experienced by an 85-year-old female patient with poor prep and subsequent complication of a coloscopy. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a markedly decreased hemoglobin and blood loss anemia after attempting an EGD and colonoscopy which were limited due to a poor prep. Despite being given proper informed consent, the patient was not well enough for surgery because of her low hemoglobin count. After undergoing a colonoscopy under conscious sedation, it was discovered that she had diverticulosis coli, internal hemorrhoids, and poor prep in her sigmoid colon.
