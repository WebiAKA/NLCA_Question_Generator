Many believe pulling out of the Paris Climate Change Agreement would be a mistake for the country because it would make it more difficult to do business internationally. Other possibilities when withdrawing are decreased standards on air pollution, which could lead to more cases of asthma and other respiratory diseases. The US would also be at a disadvantage in negotiations regarding climate change since they have withdrawn from the agreement. There are pros to withdrawing because some say that the regulations associated with reducing emissions cause increased utility costs and make it difficult for companies to find jobs, but there are also many disadvantages to this including reduced air quality and economic vulnerability in America.
