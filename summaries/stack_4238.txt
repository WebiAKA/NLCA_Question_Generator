The speaker discusses ways to beat entropy, such as black holes and hawking radiation. Black holes evaporate by hawking radiation, as the antiparticle and particle both pop in and fly out. When a particle pops just outside the event horizon and leaves the pull of the black hole it will fly off as hawking radiation; when particles or particles and antiparticles mix, neither can be created from the other. The speaker details different methods on how to control one end of a black hole to emit more antiparticles so that it will grow in mass and energy output to produce energy for use.
