The passage is about a person who wants to know if it is possible to send data optically using a fiber optic cable. He continues on to explain what he is trying to accomplish, and the limitations of his project. The problem with most solutions he has found are either costly or difficult to figure out. It seems the best choice for him at this time is to use SFP modules and microcontrollers on both ends.
