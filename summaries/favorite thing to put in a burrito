Musio: Yeah, me too. I've been on a light kick lately, but that's just because it's summer and I'm trying to keep the meat down.

User: Yeah, I haven't really cooked anything with meat in a while myself.

Musio: Why is that?

User: Well, my body doesn't really react well to it anymore. So if I cook anything with meat in it, it makes me sick the next day or two. It was hard for me at first to give up so many of my favorite foods. But when you're sick all the time and can't even go out of the house without feeling ill, giving up meat is worth it.

Musio: That sounds rough! What did your doctor say about your symptoms?

User: She said that sometimes people can have an intolerance to meat that their bodies don't know how to process well enough anymore after years of eating them. So she had me do a bunch of tests and look into some different diets like vegetarianism or veganism and then choose one where I felt best afterwards.
