What's your favorite topping for ice cream?

user: I really like whipped cream, but I also like marshmallows and chocolate sprinkles. Sometimes I like putting all three on my ice cream together!

Musio: That sounds amazing! You seem to have a lot of different favorite toppings. Do you think you're an adventurous eater?

user: Yeah, I guess so. A lot of people are intimidated by new foods and try to stick with the same thing over and over again, but I'm not afraid to try new things.
