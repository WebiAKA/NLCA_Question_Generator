Many people get the observer out of quantum theory by looking at a different perspective. Sean Carroll, for example, likes to look at Everett's many worlds concept in which there are an infinite number of universes, and every time you have a possibility for what happens it occurs in another universe. The purpose of this is to find your way out of the paradoxes of quantum theory such as wavefunction collapse and observer effect. A thought was that since we never actually measure particle location but sense a photon that it emits, why couldn't the wave function break down after emission without an observer or measurement? After the emission, the particle would return to being a probability function. What is missing here?
