A 55-year-old female experiences pain in her right shoulder due to degenerative joint disease. The rotator cuff and glenoid are intact. It is determined that a hemi-resurfacing is appropriate for the patient's right shoulder due to the severity of her arthritis. A size 5 biomet copeland humeral head component was used, however, no complications occurred.The procedure was a success with excellent range of motion and no gross dislocation.
