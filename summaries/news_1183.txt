"Betty Boothroyd has said the House of Lords needs its own Speaker and that peers should lead the way on reforming the upper chamber." 
Baroness Boothroyd believes Tony Blair initiated reforms without a clear outcome in mind, while Labour removed all but 92 of the Lords' 750 hereditary peers. "The lord chancellor hinted further reforms could be unveiled in the next Labour manifesto." The lord chancellor currently has the role of House of Lords speaker. He is also head of the judiciary and a member of the Cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary.
