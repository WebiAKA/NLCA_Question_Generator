Wales gained the upper hand in this game after some early Welsh errors, and with a strong performance from Stephen Jones. They scored three tries at halftime to give themselves breathing room to seal their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years. Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute; Luciano Orquera answering back quickly with one for Italy before Wales got two more halfway through the second half, after some excellent Welsh support work.
