The release of a film about the Mumbai (Bombay) blasts in 1993 has been postponed following protests by those on trial for the bombings. The film, Black Friday, is based upon a novel written by journalist S Hussain Zaidi and was due to open across India on Friday. The 36 people accused in connection with the blasts said it should not be screened until the trial is over. A Mumbai High Court judge postponed the film's launch until 3 February. Director Anurag Kashyap said the film's release should not be delayed as the book has already been on sale for two years and that "if you have not gone against the book, then how can you go against the movie?" Black Friday is one of India's longest-running trials where 609 witnesses have testified.
