Apple has issued a lawsuit to prevent future product leaks. The complaint, filed with the Santa Clara California Superior Court, has not been able to identify any of the defendants. Apple said it would amend the complaint once they discovered the names of those who had leaked information. It is not the first time Apple has taken legal action against someone who posted their secret products online.
