After anesthesia was administered, time out was taken to ensure correct patient, procedure, and site. The face was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The right ear tag was examined first. This was a small piece of skin and cartilaginous material protruding just from the tragus. The lesion was excised and injected with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and then excised using an elliptical-style incision. Dissection was carried down the subcutaneous tissue to remove any cartilaginous attachment to the tragus. After this was done, the wound was cauterized and then closed using interrupted 5-0 Monocryl. Attention was then turned towards the palate. The Dingman mouthgag was inserted and the palate was injected with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine. After giving this 5 minutes to take effect, the palate was incised along its margins. The anterior oral mucosa was lifted off and held demonstrating the underlying levator muscle. Muscle was freed up from its attachments at the junction of the hard palate and swept down so that it will be approximated across the midline. The Z-plasties were then designed, so there would be opposing Z-plasties from the nasal mucosa compared to the oral mucosa. The nasal mucosa was sutured first using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl. Next, the muscle was reapproximated using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl with an attempt to overlap the muscle in the midline. In addition, the remnant of the uvula tissue was found and was sutured in such a place that it would add some extra bulk to the nasal surface of the palate. Following this, the oral layer of mucosa was repaired using an opposing Z-plasty compared to the nasal layer. This was also sutured in place using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.

Plan is for repair of both.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site and the patient's identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. A right inguinal incision was then made with 15 blade knife and further extended with electrocautery down to the subcutaneous tissue and electrocautery was also used for hemostasis. The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised with 15 blade knife and further extended with curved tenotomy scissors. Using a curved mosquito clamp, we gently dissected into the inguinal canal until we got the hernia sac and dissected it out of the canal. The cord structures were then dissected off the sac and then the sac itself was divided in the midline, twisted upon itself and suture ligated up at the peritoneal reflection with 3-0 Vicryl suture. This was done twice. The distal end where a large hydrocele noted, was gently milked into the lower aspect of the incision. The hydrocele sac was then opened and drained and then the testis was delivered into the field. The sac was then opened completely around the testis. The appendix testis was cauterized. We wrapped the sac around the back of the testis and tacked into place using the Lord maneuver using 4-0 Vicryl as a figure-of-eight suture. Once this was done, the testis was then placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation. Ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation was then done with 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. A similar procedure was done on the left side, also finding a small hernia, which was divided and ligated with the 3-0 Vicryl as on the right side and distally the hydrocele sac was also wrapped around the back of the testis in a Lord maneuver after opening the sac completely. Again both testes were placed into the scrotum after the hydroceles were treated and then the external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and the cord structures not involved in the closure. Scarpa fascia was closed with 4-0 chromic suture on each side and the skin was closed with 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on both incisions.

This loose body was then subsequently removed. It measured 24 x 14 mm. This was actually the OCD lesion seen on the MRI that had come from the weightbearing surface of just the lateral posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:, The patient is 13-year-old male with persistent left knee pain. He was initially seen at Sierra Pacific Orthopedic Group where an MRI demonstrated unstable OCD lesion of the left knee. The patient presented here for a second opinion. Surgery was recommended grossly due to the instability of the fragment. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed. The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, possible need for other surgical procedures, and possible early arthritis. All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh. The extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion. The standard portals were marked on the skin. The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg. The portal incisions were then made by an #11 blade. Camera was inserted into the lateral joint line. There was a noted large cartilage loose body in the suprapatellar pouch. This was subsequently removed with extension of the anterolateral portal. Visualization of the rest of the knee revealed significant synovitis. The patient had a large cartilage defect in the posterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle. The remainder of the knee demonstrated no other significant cartilage lesions, loose bodies, plica or meniscal pathology. ACL was also visualized to be intact in the intracondylar notch.,Attention was then turned back to the large defect. The loose cartilage was debrided using a shaver. Microfracture technique was then performed to 4 mm depth at 2 to 3 mm distances. Tourniquet was released at the end of the case to ensure that there was fat and bleeding at the microfracture sites. All instruments were then removed. The portals were closed using #4-0 Monocryl. A total of 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the knee. Wounds were then cleaned and dried, and dressed in Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and bias. The patient was then placed in a knee immobilizer. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The tourniquet was released at 37 minutes. He was taken to recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:, The loose cartilage fragment was given to the family. The intraoperative findings were relayed with intraoperative photos. There was a large deficit in the weightbearing portion of medial femoral condyle. His prognosis is guarded given the fact of the fragile lesion and location, but in advantages of his age and his rehab potential down the road, if the patient still has symptoms, he may be a candidate for osteochondral autograft, a procedure which is not performed at Children's or possible cartilaginous transplant.

This morning, the patient developed worsening hypoxia with abundant sputum production requiring frequent suctioning from his ET tube. The patient also had new-appearing atelectasis versus infiltrates in the right lower lobe of his lung on chest x-ray. Given these findings, it was felt that bronchoscopy could further define source of secretions and send more appropriate specimen for culture if need be.,OPERATION:, The patient was given additional fentanyl, Versed as well as paralytics for the procedure. Small bronchoscope was inserted through the ET tube and to the trachea to the level of carina. There was noted to be thick clear secretions adherent to the trachea walls as well as into the right mainstem bronchus. Extensive secretions extended down into the secondary airways. This was lavaged with saline and suctioned dry. There is no overt specific occlusion of airways, nor was there any purulent-appearing sputum.

Visual field testing showed *% superior hemifield loss on the right, and *% superior hemifield loss on the left. These field losses resolved with upper eyelid taping which simulates the expected surgical correction. Photodocumentation also showed the upper eyelids resting on the upper eyelashes, as well as a decrease in the effective superior marginal reflex distance. The risks, benefits, limitations, alternatives, and expected improvement in symptoms and visual field loss were discussed in preoperative evaluation.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, On the day of surgery, the surgical site and procedure were verified by the physician with the patient. An informed consent was signed and witnessed. EMLA cream was applied to the eyelids and eyebrow region for 10 minutes to provide skin anesthesia. Two drops of topical proparacaine eye drops were placed on the ocular surface. The skin was cleaned with alcohol prep pads. The patient received 3 to 4 mL of 2% Lidocaine with epinephrine and 0.5% Marcaine mixture to each upper lid. 5 to 6 mL of local were also given to the brow region along the entire length. Pressure was applied over each site for 5 minutes. The patient was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for oculoplastic surgery.,The desired amount of redundant brow tissue to be excised was carefully marked with a surgical marking pen on each side. The contour of the outline was created to provide a greater temporal lift. Care was taken to preserve a natural contour to the brow shape consistent with the patient\u2019s desired features. Using a #15 blade, the initial incision was placed just inside the superior most row of brow hairs, in parallel with the follicle growth orientation. The incision extended in a nasal to temporal fashion with the nasal portion incision being carried down to muscle and becoming progressively shallower toward the tail of the incision line. The dimensions of the redundant tissue measured * horizontally and * vertically. The redundant tissue was removed sharply with Westcott scissors. Hemostasis was maintained with hand held cautery and/or electrocautery. The closure was carried out in multiple layers. The deepest muscular/subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 transparent nylon in a horizontal mattress fashion. The intermediate layer was closed with 5-0 Vicryl similarly. The skin was closed with 6-0 nylon in a running lock fashion. Iced saline gauze pads were placed over the incision sites. This completed the brow repair portion of the case.,Using a surgical marking pen, a vertical line was drawn from the superior punctum to the eyebrow. An angled line was drawn from the ala of the nares to the lateral canthus edge and extending to the tail of the brow. These lines served as the relative boundary for the horizontal length of the blepharoplasty incision. The desired amount of redundant tissue to be excised was carefully pinched together with 0.5 forceps. This tissue was outlined with a surgical marking pen. Care was taken to avoid excessive skin removal near the brow region. A surgical ruler was used to ensure symmetry. The skin and superficial orbicularis were incised with a #15 blade on the first upper lid. This layer was removed with Westcott scissors.,Hemostasis was achieved with high-temp hand held pen cautery. The remaining orbicularis and septum were grasped superiorly and inferiorly on each side of the incision and tented upward. The high temp cautery pen was then used to incise these layers in a horizontal fashion until preapeuronotic fat was identified. * amount of central preaponeurotic fat was removed with cautery. * amount of nasal fat pad was removed in the same fashion. Care was taken to not disturb the levator aponeurosis. A symmetric amount of fat was removed from each side. Iced gauze saline was placed over the site and the entire procedure repeated on the fellow eyelid. Skin hooks were placed on either side of the incision and the skin was closed in a continuous running fashion with 6-0 nylon. Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment was placed over the incision site and on the ocular surface. Saline gauze and cold packs were placed over the upper lids. The patient was taken from the surgical suite in good condition.,DISCHARGE:, In the recovery area the results of surgery were discussed with the patient and their family. Specific instructions to resume all p.o. oral medications including anticoagulants/antiplatelets were given.

This incision was carried down to the area of the previous vasectomy. A towel clip was placed around this. Next the scarred area was dissected free back to normal vas proximally and distally. Approximately 4 cm of vas was freed up. Next the vas was amputated above and below the scar tissue. Fine hemostats were used to grasp the adventitial tissue on each side of the vas, both the proximal and distal ends. Both ends were then dilated very carefully with lacrimal duct probes up to a #2 successfully. After accomplishing this, fluid could be milked from the proximal vas which was encouraging.,Next the reanastomosis was performed. Three 7-0 Prolene were used and full thickness bites were taken through the muscle layer of the vas deferens and into the lumen. This was all done with 3.5 loupe magnification.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nTotal Knee Replacement - 1, PROCEDURES:, Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:, The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh. Sterile prepping and draping proceeded. The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg. A midline incision was made, centered over the patella. Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues. A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally. Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues. The ACL and PCL were released. The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed. These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia. An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia. Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate. The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques. An anterior rough cut was made. The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed. The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment. Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made. The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made. The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit. A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes. Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked. The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again. The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau. A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made. The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia. The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension. Patellar width was checked with calipers. A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers. Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy. Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed. The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking. The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried. The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted. The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee. The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened. Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated. The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome. Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed. The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned. Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed. The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures. The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures. The skin was sealed with staples. Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.

The upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch dressing. The tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. The entire operation was performed with 4.5 loop magnification. At this time an approximately 8 cm longitudinal incision was then made overlying the right flexor carpi radialis tendon from the flexion crease to the wrist proximally. This was carried down to the flexor carpi radialis, which was then retracted ulnarly. The floor of the flexor carpi radialis was then incised exposing the flexor pronator muscles. The flexor pollicis longus was retracted ulnarly and the pronator quadratus was longitudinally incised 1 cm from its origin. It was then elevated off of the fracture site exposing the fracture site, which was dorsally displaced. This was an intraarticular four-part fracture. Under image control, the two volar pieces and dorsal pieces were then carefully manipulated and reduced. Then, 2.06 two-inch K-wires were drilled radial into the volar ulnar fragment and then a second K-wire was then drilled from the dorsal radial to the dorsal ulnar piece. A third K-wire was then drilled from the volar radial to the dorsal ulnar piece. The fracture was then manipulated. The fracture ends were copiously irrigated with normal saline and curetted and then the fracture was reduced in the usual fashion by recreating the defect and distracting it. Further K-wires were then placed through the radial styloid into the proximal fragment. A Hand Innovations DVR plate of regular size for the right wrist was then fashioned over and placed over the distal radius and secured with two K-wires. At this time, the distal screws were then placed. The distal screws were the small screws. These were non-locking screws, all eight screws were placed. They were placed in the usual fashion by drilling with a small drill bit removing the small introducers and then using its depth. Again, these were 18-20 mm screws. After placing three of the screws it was necessary to remove the K-wires. There was excellent reduction of the fragments and the fracture; excellent reduction of the intraarticular component and the fracture. After the distal screws were placed, the fracture was reduced and held in place with K-wires, which were replaced and the proximal screws were drilled with the drill guide and the larger drill bit. The screws were then placed. These were 12 mm screws. They were placed 4 in number. The K-wires were then removed. Finally, a 3 cm intrathenar incision was made beginning 1 cm distal to the flexor crease of the wrist. This was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament, which was divided throughout the length of the incision, upon entering the carpal canal, the median nerve was found to be adherent to the undersurface of the structure. It was dissected free from the structure out to its trifurcation. The motor branches seen entering the thenar fascia and obstructed. The nerve was then retracted dorsally and the patient had a great deal of scar tissue in the area of the volar flexion crease to the wrist where she had a previous incision that extended from the volar flexion crease of the wrist overlying the palmaris longus proximally for 1 cm. In this area, careful dissection was performed in order to move the nerve from the surrounding structures and the most proximal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament, the more proximally located volar carpal ligament was then divided 5 cm into the distal forearm on the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon. Incisions were then copiously irrigated with normal saline. Homeostasis was maintained with electrocautery. The pronator quadratus was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the above skin incisions were closed proximally with 4-0 nylon and palmar incision with 5-0 nylon in the horizontal mattress fashion. A large bulky dressing was then applied with a volar short-arm splint maintaining the wrist in neutral position. The tourniquet was let down. The fingers were immediately pink. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no operative complications.

Left canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy with ossicular chain reconstruction.,2. Microdissection.,3. NIM facial nerve monitoring for three hours.,COMPLICATIONS: ,None.,FINDINGS:, There is an extremely large canal cholesteatoma, which eroded most of the posterior and superior canal wall. There was a significant amount of myringosclerosis and tympanosclerosis. There is some mild erosion of the lenticular process of the incus. The facial nerve was normal. We removed the incus, removed the head of the malleus, and placed a titanium-PORP from the stapes capitulum to a cartilage graft.,PROCEDURE:, The patient was taken to the operating room, placed under general anesthetic and intubated without difficulty. The NIM facial nerve monitoring electrodes were positioned and monitoring was performed throughout the procedure. There was no abnormal activity during this case. We inspected the ear canal, identified the huge defect, which was completely filled with cerumen. Through the ear canal, we removed as much as we could and then infiltrated the canal and postauricular area with 1:100,000 of epinephrine.,We prepped and draped the ear in a sterile fashion. We reopened the previously used postauricular incision and dissected down the mastoid cortex. We reflected the soft tissues anteriorly to the level of the ear canal and identified where the ear canal skin entered the defect in the mastoid bone. A #6 cutting bur was used to drill down the mastoid cortex and identified this cholesteatoma which was then carefully dissected out. We went all the way to the mastoid antrum. We finished a complete mastoidectomy with identification of the tegmen, sigmoid sinus. We removed the lateral aspect of the mastoid tip. We lowered the facial ridge. The incudostapedial joint was already membranous in nature, we went ahead and used the joint knife and removed the incus. We separated the incus from the stapes and then removed it. We used a malleus head nipper to remove the head of the malleus and then we continued to saucerize the entire mastoid cavity.,There was no cholesteatoma within the middle ear space, but there was roughly 40% surface area perforation. The remaining portion of the tympanic membrane was extremely calcified and myringosclerotic; this was removed. There was also a large focus of tympanosclerosis between the stapes crura, which was impinging the ability of the stapes to move. We carefully dissected this out. This did seem to improve the mobility of the stapes somewhat. At this point, there was a near total perforation. There was only a minimal amount of anterior remnant of the drum left. We tried to go ahead and harvest the temporalis fascia, but there was really only wisps of this fascia in place. He had already had a previous tympanoplasty, but even outside the areas where the graft was taken, the temporalis muscle was quite atrophied and lumpy, and I suspect this was due to his chronic disease and long history of corticosteroid usage. We harvested a few pieces as best as we could. We went ahead and did a meatoplasty by making a canal incision in the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions. We excised cartilage posteriorly and inferiorly to enlarge the meatus. This cartilage was thin and used for cartilage tympanoplasty. We placed some Gelfoam in the middle ear space and placed the cartilage on the top of it. We did cut a titanium-PORP of the proper side and placed on top of the stapes capitulum to interface with the cartilage cap. A few other small pieces of temporalis fascia were used to bulge through the surrounding edges of the cartilage and make sure that it was medial to any remnant of ear canal and tympanic membrane remnants. We placed a layer of Gelfoam lateral to the graft, closed the postauricular incision in layers and put 2 Merocel packs in the ear. Glasscock dressing was applied.

A portion of the procedure was done in consult with Dr. X with separate dictation by him.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: ,This is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing. He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm. He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow. His parents' were both present preoperatively. His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region. Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible. He did have a radial pulse palpable.,PROCEDURE:, After discussing the alternatives of the case as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations with the patient's parents including malunion, nonunion, gross deformity, growth arrest, infection, loss of elbow motions, stiffness, instability, need for surgery in the future, nerve problems, artery problems, and compartment syndrome, they elected to proceed.,The patient was laid supine upon operative table after receiving general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department. Closed reduction was accomplished in a sequential manner. Milking of the soft tissue envelope was carried out to try and reduce the shaft of the humerus back into its plane relative to the brachialis muscle and the neurovascular bundle anteriorly. Then a slow longitudinal traction was carried out. The elbow was hyperflexed. Pressure placed upon the olecranon tip and two 0.045 K-wires placed first, one being on the lateral side and with this placement on the medial side of medial epicondyle with care taken to protect the ulnar nerve. The close reduction was deemed to be acceptable once viewed on C-arm.,After this, pulse was attempted to be palpated distally. Prior to the procedure, I talked to Dr. X of Vascular Surgery at ABCD Hospital. He had scrubbed in to the case to follow up on the loss of the radial artery distally. This was not present palpatory, but also by Doppler. A weak ulnar artery pulse was present via Doppler. Because of this, the severe displacement of the injury and the fact that the Doppler sound had an occlusion-type sound just above the fracture site or _______. A long discussion was carried out with Dr. X and myself, and we decided to proceed with exploration of the brachial artery. Prior to this, I went out to the waiting room to discuss with the patient's parents, the reasoning what we are going to do and the reasoning for this. I then came back in and then we proceeded. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Please see Dr. X's report for the discussion of the exploration and release of the brachial artery. There was no indication that it was actually in the fracture site, the soft tissue had tethered in its right angle towards the fracture site, thus reducing its efficiency of providing blood distally. Once it was released, both clinically on the table as well as by Doppler, the patient had bounding pulses.,We then proceeded to close utilizing a #4-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous fat closure and a running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch for skin closure. Steri-Strips were placed. The patient's arm was placed in just a slight degree of flexion with a neutral position. He was splinted posteriorly. Adaptic and fluffs have been placed around the patient's pin sites. K-wires have been bent, cut, and pin caps placed.,Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded for the obvious reasons noted above. There is concern for growth plate disturbance.

There were two 4.0 cancellous partially-threaded screws placed.,GROSS FINDINGS: ,Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is an 87-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall. The patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell. The patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room. At that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert-Jones splint. After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care.,PROCEDURE: ,After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained. The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient. This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes. Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle. A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures. Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified. The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site. The wound was copiously irrigated and dried. Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position. There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone. It was held in place with reduction forceps. A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation. It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula. Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each. The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length. Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole. The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length. Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position. There was no lateralization of the joints. Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle. Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus. Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site. The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures. Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum. The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus. There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies. Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire. Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length. These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position. Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws. They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint. At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin. A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril. A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity. This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain. Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot. Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother. Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures. The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months. All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. A bump was placed underneath the left buttock. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the left thigh. The extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion. The patient had a previous incision along the calcaneocuboid lateral part of the foot. This was marked and extended proximally through the Achilles tendon. Extremity was wrapped in Esmarch. Tourniquet inflation was noted to be 250 mmHg. Decision was then made to protect the sural nerve. There was one sensory nervous branch that did cross the field though it was subsequently sharply ligated because it was in the way. Dissection was carried down to Achilles tendon, which was subsequently de-lengthened with the distal half performed down the lateral thigh. Proximal end was tacked with an 0 Ethibond suture and subsequently repaired end-on-end at length with the heel in neutral. Dissection was then carried on the lateral border of the foot with identification of the peroneal longus and valgus tendons, which were removed from the sheath and retracted dorsally. At this time, we also noted that calcaneocuboid joint appeared to be fused. The area between the anterior and middle facets were plicated on fluoroscopy for planned osteotomy. This was performed with a saw. After a partial plantar fasciotomy was performed, this was released off an abductor digiti minimi. The osteotomy was completed with an osteotome and distracted with the lamina spreader. A tricortical allograft was then shaped and subsequently impacted into this area. Final positioning was checked with multiple views of fluoroscopy. It was subsequently fixed using a 0.94 K-wire and drilled from the heel anteriorly. A pin was subsequently bent and cut short at the level of the skin. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline. The Achilles was repaired with this tie. Please note during the case, it was noted the patient had continued significant stiffness despite the Achilles lengthening. A posterior capsulotomy of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints were performed with increased 10 degrees of dorsiflexion. Wound was then closed using #2-0 Vicryl and #4-0 Monocryl. The surgical field was irrigated with 0.25% Marcaine and subsequently injected with more Marcaine at the end of the case. The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform. Skin was dressed with Xeroform and 4 x 4's. Everything was wrapped with 4 x 4's in sterile Webril. The tourniquet was released after 69 minutes.

The medial lateral meniscus showed small amounts of degeneration, but no frank tears were seen. The articular surfaces and the remainder of the knee appeared intact. Cruciate ligaments also appeared intact to direct stress testing.,HISTORY: ,This is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain. She has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella. She has failed conservative therapy. It was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint. She elected to proceed with the surgical intervention. All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her. She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE:, On 09/04/03, she was taken to Operating Room at ABCD General Hospital. She was placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department. Her leg was placed in a Johnson knee holder and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A stab incision was made in inferolateral and parapatellar regions. Through this the cannula was placed and the knee was inflated with saline solution. Intraoperative pictures were obtained. The above findings were noted. Second portal site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region. Through this, a arthroscopic shaver was placed and the chondroplasty in the patella was performed and removed the loose articular debris. Next, the camera was placed through the inferomedial portal. An arthroscopic Bovie was placed through the inferolateral portal. A release of lateral retinaculum was then performed using the Bovie. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery. Next, the knee was suctioned dry. An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity. Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg. An oblique incision was made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee. The subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected and the hemostasis was again controlled with electrocautery. The retinaculum was then incised in line with the incision. The patellar tendon was identified. The lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris. Next, an osteotome was then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact. The tubercle was then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her Q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle. It was then held in place with a Steinmann pin. Following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle. There was excellent fixation noted. The Q-angle was noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees. She was transferred approximately 1 cm in length. The wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial retinaculum was then plicated causing further medialization of the patella. The retinaculum was reapproximated using #0 Vicryl. Subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed with #4-0 Vicryl running PDS suture. Sterile dressing was applied to the lower extremities. She was placed in a Donjoy knee immobilizer locked in extension. It was noted that the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill following deflation of the tourniquet.

Sterile Hibiclens and alcohol prep and drape were then undertaken. A fluoroscopic localization was undertaken. Gentle traction was applied. Narrow arthrographic effect was obtained. Following this, the ProTrac portal was made under the fluoro visualization, and then, a direct anterolateral portal made and a femoral neck portal made under direct visualization. The diagnostic arthroscopy showed the articular surface to be intact with a moderate anterior lip articular cartilage delamination injury that propagated into the acetabulum. For this reason, the acetabular articular cartilage was taken down and stabilized. This necessitated takedown of the anterior lip of the acetabulum and subsequent acetabular osteoplasty debridement with associated labral repair. The labrum was repaired using absorbable Smith & Nephew anchors with a sliding SMC knot. After stabilization of the labrum and the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres was assessed and noted to be stable. The remnant articular surface of the femoral artery and acetabulum was stable. The posterior leg was stable. The traction was left half off, and the anterolateral aspect of the head and neck junction was identified. A stable femoral neck decompression was accomplished starting laterally and proceeding anteriorly. This terminated with the hip coming out of traction and indeterminable flexion. A combination of burs and shavers was utilized to perform a stable femoral neck osteoplasty decompression. The decompression was completed with thorough irrigation of the hip. The cannula was removed, and the portals were closed using interrupted nylon. The patient was placed into a sterile bandage and anesthetized intraarticularly with 10 mL of ropivacaine subcutaneously with 20 mL of ropivacaine and at this point was taken to the recovery room. He tolerated the procedure very well with no signs of complications.orthopedic, labral repair, femoral neck osteoplasty, arthroscopic debridement, femoroacetabular impingement, arthroscopic, femoroacetabular, impingement, debridement, osteoplasty, acetabulum\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the condition of the hip after arthroscopic labral repair, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), arthroscopic debridement, and femoral neck osteoplasty?\nWhat are the conditions before surgical correction?\nWhat types of surgeries were performed on the patient's hip?\nHow much traction was required to perform a safe hip surgery?\nHow did the anesthesiologist measure localized pain levels in order to align a safe level of general anesthesia for surgery?\nWhat positions were used during surgery?\nWhich body part was operated on first: right or left leg?"}

We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion. The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication. The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut. He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded. The tape was placed and his arms were well padded. He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region. We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space. We then marked the disc space. We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space. We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates. We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well. We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone. We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space. We then sized a 23-mm plate. We inserted the screws nicely above and below. We tightened down the lock-nuts. We irrigated the wound. We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate. We then assured hemostasis once again. We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion. The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion. The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips were applied. Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this.

The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy. A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3. Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate. We placed in self-retaining retractors. With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5. After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid.,We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal. In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit. It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis. With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4. We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4. These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase. We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves. The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision. The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin. Blood loss was about 50 mL. No complication of the surgery. Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct.,The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb. At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation. At both levels, he has high-grade spinal stenosis at these levels, especially foramen stenosis causing the compression, neck pain, headaches, and arm and shoulder pain.

A C5-C7 anterior cervical plate fixation (Sofamor Danek titanium window plate) intraoperative fluoroscopy used and intraoperative microscopy used. Intraoperative SSEP and EMG monitoring used.,ANESTHESIA:, General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:, This lady presented with history of cervical pain associated with cervical radiculopathy with cervical and left arm pain, numbness, weakness, with MRI showing significant disk protrusions with the associate complexes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated cervical radiculopathy. After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees. A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support. The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle. In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done. Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly. Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy. Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly. A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint. On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect. This was done under the microscope. A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus. A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level. This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen. Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released. Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right. This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots. With this done, the wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation. Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites. Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed. A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7. The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7. With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down. A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site. Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling.

Through the IV, the patient received IV sedation in the form of propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administrated consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain. Approximately 3 mL were administered. The patient then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lens, lashes, and eye. During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes. A Vicryl traction suture was placed through the superior cornea and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior temporal conjunctiva. Approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to limbus, the conjunctiva was incised and dissected forward to the limbus. Blunt dissection was carried out in the superotemporal quadrant. Next, a 2 x 3-mm scleral flap was outlined that was one-half scleral depth in thickness. This flap was cut forward to clear cornea using a crescent blade. The Ahmed shunt was then primed and placed in the superior temporal quadrant and it was sutured in place with two 8-0 nylon sutures. The knots were trimmed. The tube was then cut to an appropriate length to enter the anterior chamber. The anterior chamber was then entered after a paracentesis wound had been made temporally.

After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh. Sterile prepping and draping proceeded. The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg. A midline incision was made, centered over the patella. Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues. A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally. Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues. The ACL and PCL were released. The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed. These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia. An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia. Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate. The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques. An anterior rough cut was made. The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed. The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment. Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made. The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made. The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit. A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes. Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked. The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again. The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau. A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made. The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia. The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension. Patellar width was checked with calipers. A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers. Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy. Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed. The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking. The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried. The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted. The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee. The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened. Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated. The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome. Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed. The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned. Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed. The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.

She was placed in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made removing the old scar with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife. The fascia was excised in the midline extended laterally with the Mayo scissors. The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors. There was noted dense adhesions at this point as well as a wire mesh was noted. The anterior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply as well as bluntly. The rectus muscle superiorly was opened with a hemostat. The peritoneum was identified and entered bluntly digitally. The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly up to the level of the mesh. Then, inferiorly using the knife, the adhesions were taken down and the bladder was identified and the peritoneum incision extended inferiorly to the level of the bladder. The bladder blade was inserted and vesicouterine peritoneum was identified and tented up with Allis clamps and bladder flap was created sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors digitally. The bladder blade was then reinserted to protect the bladder and the uterine incision was made with a first knife and then extended laterally with the Bandage scissors. The amniotic fluid was noted to be clear. At this point, upon examining the intrauterine contents, the baby was noted to be breached. The right foot was identified and then the baby was delivered from the double footling breach position without any difficulty. The cord was clamped and the baby was then handed off to awaiting pediatricians. The placenta cord gases were obtained and the placenta was then manually extracted from the uterus. The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.

Her pregnancy is complicated by preterm contractions. She was on bedrest since her 34th week. She also has a history of tobacco abuse with asthma. She was admitted here and labor was confirmed with rupture of membranes. She was initially 5, 70%, -1. Her bag was ruptured, IUPC was placed. She received an epidural for pain control and Pitocin augmentation was performed. She progressed for several hours to complete and to push, then pushed for approximately 15 minutes to deliver a vigorous female infant from OA presentation. Delivery of the head was manual assisted. The shoulders and the rest of body then followed without difficulty. Baby was bulb suctioned, had a vigorous cry. Cord was clamped twice and cut and the infant was handed to the awaiting nursing team. Placenta then delivered spontaneously and intact, was noted to have a three-vessel cord. The inspection of the perineum revealed it to be intact. There was a hymenal remnant/skin tag that was protruding from the vaginal introitus. I discussed this with the patient. She opted to have it removed. This was performed and I put a single interrupted suture 3-0 Vicryl for hemostasis. Further inspection revealed bilateral superficial labial lacerations that were hemostatic and required no repair. Overall EBL is 300 mL. Mom and baby are currently doing well.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nSkull Base Reconstruction, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,PROCEDURE:, Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3.,ANESTHESIA:, General endotracheal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the table in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion. The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen. The neck was prepped as well. After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl. A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle. After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible. The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared. The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out. The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen. The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen. The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis. A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use. I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb. It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube. The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made. I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion. Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy. For details, please see his operative note.,After Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap. A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm. The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath. Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle. The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin. The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl. The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction. The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion. The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel. The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges. The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck. The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique. Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes. Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well. There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case. The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline. The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax. The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl. I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place. The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with skin staples. There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself. The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.,The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples. The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened. The patient was then transferred to the PACU in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well.neurosurgery, rectus abdominis myocutaneous, skull base defect, squamous cell carcinoma, skull base, squamous cell, rectus sheath, abdominis, muscle, rectus, sheath\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What condition of the skull base is the patient diagnosed with?\nHow does this treatment affect their subsequent diagnosis post-operatively?\nWhat is the surgeon's role in this surgery?\nDoes the surgeon operate alone or as part of a team?\nDo any other surgeons assist?

Last surgery consisted of four-level decompression on 08/28/06. The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius. Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis. It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention; however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial. Based on this, I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 with no spinal instrumentation. Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery. Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection. Infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection. There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord. This may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma. There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis. This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair. The patient understood the risk of the surgery. I told him there is just a 30% chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress. After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted. Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring. The SSEPs were normal, and the EMGs were silent during the entire case. After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support. Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region. All pressure points were padded. I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision. This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade #10. Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar. Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of C2 was then identified. There was absence of the spinous process of C3, C4, C5, and C6, but partial laminectomy was noted; removal of only 15% of the lamina. With this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3, C4, C5, and C6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery. There was also a dural tear on the right C3-C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6-0 and later with Tisseel. By careful dissection and the use of a -5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7. There was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated. At two points, I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam. After repair of the dural tear, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage. Area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with Tisseel. The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia; Vicryl 2-0 inverted interrupted sutures to the dermis and a running nylon 2-0 continuous vertical mattress stitch. The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.nan\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the diagnosis?\nWhat is the procedure performed?\nWhat complications might occur postoperatively?\nIs there a procedural step that is particularly unusual or noteworthy?"}

The entire left scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion after having being placed in 2-point skeletal fixation. Next, we made an inverted-U fashion base over the asterion over temporoparietal area of the skull. A free flap was elevated after the scalp that was reflected using the burr hole and craniotome. The bone flap was placed aside and soaked in the bacitracin solution.,The dura was then opened in an inverted-U fashion. Using the Stealth, we could see that this large cystic mass was just below the cortex in the white matter just anterior to the trigone of the ventricle. We head through the vein of Labbe, and we made great care to preserve this. We saw where the tumor almost made to the surface. Here we made a small corticectomy using the Stealth for guidance. We left small corticectomy entered large cavity with approximately 15 cc of yellowish necrotic liquid. This was submitted to pathology. We biopsied this very abnormal tissue and submitted it to pathology. They gave us a frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. With the operating microscope and Greenwood bipolar forceps, we then systematically debulked this tumor. It was very vascular and we really continued to remove this tumor until all visible tumors was removed. We appeared to get two gliotic planes circumferentially. We could see it through the ventricle. After removing all visible tumor grossly, we then irrigated this cavity multiple times and obtained meticulous hemostasis and then closed the dura primarily with 4-0 Nurolon sutures with the piece of DuraGen placed over this in order to increase our chances for a good watertight seal. The bone flap was then replaced and sutured with the Lorenz titanium plate system. The muscle fascia galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures. Skin staples were used for skin closure. The blood loss of the operation was about 200 cc. There were no complications of the surgery per se. The needle count, sponge count, and the cottonoid count were correct.,COMMENT: ,Operating microscope was quite helpful in this; as we could use the light as well as the magnification to help us delineate the brain tumor - gliotic interface and while it was vague at sometimes we could I think clearly get a good cleavage plane in most instances so that we got a gross total removal of this very large and necrotic-looking tumor of the brain.neurosurgery, temporal lobe, brain tumor, lorenz titanium plate, burr hole, cortex, corticectomy, craniotome, craniotomy, frozen section, glioblastoma multiforme, temporal craniotomy, temporoparietal, ventricle, white matter, tumor, temporal, brain,\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What was the patient's diagnosis?\nWhat surgical procedure was done on the patient?\nWere there any complications with surgery?\nHow was the tumor removed from the brain?"}

After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the McIvor mouth gag was placed in the oral cavity and a tongue depressor applied. Two #12-French red rubber Robinson catheters were placed, 1 in each nasal passage, and brought out through the oral cavity and clamped over a dental gauze roll on the upper lip to provide soft palate retraction. The nasopharynx was inspected with the laryngeal mirror.,Attention was then directed to the right tonsil. The anterior tonsillar pillar was infiltrated with 1.5 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, as was the left tonsillar pillar. The right tonsil was grasped with the tenaculum and retracted out of its fossa. The anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with the #12 knife blade.

He was rendered unconscious by the head injury. He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi. This workup was negative. The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker. The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma. There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes. I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity. The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion. There was a roll beneath the right shoulder. The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint. Markings were applied. Sterile drapes were applied. A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline. Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia. Weitlaner retractors were inserted. A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle. I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis. A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm. The bone was set aside. The dura was clearly discolored and very tense. The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade. There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure. Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity. The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section. The margins of the membrane were coagulated. The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery. The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none. The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon. Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system. The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers. Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl.

A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess neuropsychological factors, clarify areas of strength and weakness, and to assist in therapeutic program planning in light of episodes of syncope.,BRIEF SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS:,RELEVANT HISTORY:,Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and an interview with ,the patient.,The patient presented to Dr. X on August 05, 2008 as she had been recently hospitalized for prolonged episodes of syncope. She was referred to Dr. X for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope. The patient reports an extensive neurological history. Her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient. In spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved honors in school and looked smart. She reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age. At 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus. She reported that she will frequently bang her head against the wall to relieve the pain. The patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age. At 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches. She reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and thrown two and a half city blocks. The patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day. She reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month. Her migraines became more severe following the head injury. In 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights. Following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion. These episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.,The patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep. She reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused. These episodes diminished from 2002 to June 2008. When making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator. She reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes. A second episode occurred on July 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day. She was admitted to Sinai Hospital and assessed by a neurologist. Her EEG and head CT were considered to be completely normal. She did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour EEG. She reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized. She stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and tunnel vision (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was spazzing out on the floor. During these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding.,The patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old. She reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of Jack Daniel. She stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt. In 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication. At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself. The patient's medical history is also significant for postpartum depression.,The patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory. She reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes. She finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential. She experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform. She reported that she had a photographic memory for directions. She said that she experienced a great deal of emotional lability, but in general her personality has become more subdued. At the present time, her daughter has now moved on to college. The patient is living with her biological mother. Although she is going through divorce, she reported that it was not really stressful. She reported that she spends her day driving other people around and trying to be helpful to them.,At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, the patient's medication included Ativan, Imitrex, Levoxyl, vitamin B12, albuterol metered dose inhaler as needed, and Zofran as needed.

He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:, After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room. He was placed in a supine position on the operating table. After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll. Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion. After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace. The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered. The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure. The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed.,Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid. Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis. The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated. A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed. There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity. The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored. The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus. It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area. The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair. After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French. These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.,The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures. Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures. The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.,The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position. A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed. A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced. The laparoscope was introduced. A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced. It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance.

The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour. He was able to drive. However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again. Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe. He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation. He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation. He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm. The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia. Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together. He still does not drive. He also is not working due to the double vision. There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision. More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain.

He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria. He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.,PROCEDURE: ,After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position. He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder. The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing.,Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder. There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation. Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice. A retrograde pyelogram was performed. Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side. At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire. The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities. The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire. The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance. The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter. The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction. The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed. A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation. The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system. Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system. The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass. Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed. The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis. The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room. It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy.

After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the right arm was circumferentially prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion. A longitudinal incision was made from just above the antecubital crease along the medial aspect of the arm overlying the palpable thrill using a 15 blade knife. The sharp dissection was then used to identify dissection created of the basilic vein from its surrounding tissues. This was continued and the incision was elongated up the arm as the vein was exposed in a serial fashion. Branch points were then taken down using multitude of techniques based upon the luminal diameter of the branch before transection. The basilic vein was ultimately freed in its entirety from just above the antecubital crease to the axilla at the level of the axillary vein. There was noted to be excellent flow through the vein. A pocket was then created just lateral to the incision in the subcutaneous tissue. The vein was then placed into this pocket securing with multiple interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The bed of dissection of the basilic vein was then treated with fibrin sealant. The subcutaneous tissue was then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl sutures in interrupted fashion. The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl suture for a subcuticular stitch. Dermabond was applied to the incision. Again, there was noted to be good palpable thrill throughout the superficialized vein.

He fell backwards on his back and his right shoulder. He had immediate onset of shoulder pain, neck pain, and low back pain. He had pain into his right leg. He initially came under the care of Dr. H, an occupational physician in Modesto. Initially, he did not obtain any MRIs or x-rays. He did undergo some physical therapy and received some medications. Dr. H referred him to Dr. Q, a chiropractor for three visits, which the patient was not certain was very helpful. The patient advises he then changed treating physicians to Dr. N, D.C., whom he had seen previously for some back pain complaints back in 1990. He felt that the chiropractic care was helping his back, neck, and shoulder pain complaints somewhat. He continues with rather persistent pain in his right shoulder. He underwent an MRI of the right shoulder performed on 08/16/1994 which revealed prominent impingement with biceps tenosynovitis as well as supraspinatus tendonitis superimposed by a small pinhole tear of the rotator cuff. The patient was referred to Dr. P, an orthopedic surgeon who suggested some physical therapy for him and some antiinflammatories. He felt that the patient might require a cortisone injection or possibly a surgical intervention. The patient also underwent an MRI of the cervical spine on 08/03/1994, which again revealed multilevel degenerative disc disease in his neck. There is some suggestion of bilateral neuroforaminal encroachment due to degenerative changes and disc bulges, particularly at C5-6 and C6-7 levels. The patient was also seen by Dr. P, a neurologist for a Neurology consult. It is unclear to me as to whether or not Dr. P had performed an EMG or nerve conduction studies of his upper or lower extremities. The patient was off work for approximately six months following his initial injury date that occurred on 06/29/1994. He returned back to regular duty. Dr. N declared him permanent and stationary on 04/04/1995. The patient then had a recurrence or flare-up or possibly new injury, again, particularly to his lower back while working for Frito Lay on 03/29/1997, when he was loading some pallets on the back of a trailer. At that time, he returned to see Dr. N for chiropractic care, who is his primary treating physician. Dr. N took him off work again. He was off work again for approximately another six months, during which time, he was seen by Dr. M, M.D., a neurosurgeon. He had a new MRI of his lumbar spine performed. The MRI was performed on 05/20/1997. It revealed L4-5 disc space narrowing with prominent disc bulge with some mild spinal stenosis. The radiologist had noted he had a prior disc herniation at this level with some improvement from prior exam. Dr. M saw him on 09/18/1997 and noted that there was some improvement in his disc herniation at the L4-5 level following a more recent MRI exam of 05/20/1997, from previous MRI exam of 1996 which revealed a rather prominent right-sided L4-5 disc herniation. Dr. M felt that there was no indication for a lumbar spine surgery, but he mentioned with regards to his cervical spine, he felt that EMG studies of the right upper extremity should be obtained and he may require a repeat MRI of the cervical spine, if the study was positive. The patient did undergo some nerve conduction studies of his lower extremities with Dr. K, M.D., which suggested a possible abnormal EMG with evidence of possible L5 radiculopathy, both right and left. Unfortunately, I had no medical reports from Dr. P suggesting that he may have performed nerve conduction studies or EMGs of the upper and lower extremities. The patient did see Dr. R for a neurosurgical consult. Dr. R evaluated both his neck and lower back pain complaints on several occasions. Dr. R suggested that the patient try some cervical epidural steroid injections and lumbar selective nerve root blocks. The patient underwent these injections with Dr. K. The patient reported only very slight relief temporarily with regards to his back and leg symptoms following the injections. It is not clear from the medical record review whether the patient ever had a cervical epidural steroid injection; it appears that he had some selective nerve root blocks performed in the lumbar spine. Dr. R on 12/15/2004 suggested that the patient had an MRI of the cervical spine revealing a right-sided C5-6 herniated nucleus pulposus which would explain his C-6 distribution numbness. The patient also was noted to have a C4-5 with rather severe degenerative disc disease. He felt the patient might be a candidate for a two-level ACDF at C4-5 and C5-6. Dr. R in another report of 08/11/2004 suggested that the patient's MRI of 05/25/2004 of the lumbar spine reveals multilevel degenerative disc disease. He had an L4-5 slight anterior spondylolisthesis, this may be a transitional vertebrae at the L6 level as well, with lumbarization of S1. He felt that his examination suggested a possible right S1 radiculopathy with discogenic back pain. He would suggest right-sided S1 selective nerve root blocks to see if this would be helpful; if not, he might be a candidate for a lumbar spine fusion, possibly a Dynesys or a fusion or some major spine surgery to help resolve his situation., ,The patient relates that he really prefers a more conservative approach of treatment regarding his neck, back, and right shoulder symptoms. He continued to elect chiropractic care which he has found helpful, but apparently the insurance carrier is no longer authorizing chiropractic care for him. He is currently taking no medications to manage his pain complaints. He states regarding his work status, he was off work again for another six months following the 03/29/1997 injury. He returned back to work and continued to work regular duty up until about a year ago, at which time, he was taken back off work again and placed on TTD status by Dr. N, his primary treating physician. The patient states he has not been back to work since. He has since applied for social security disability and now is receiving social security disability benefits. The patient states he has tried some Myox therapy with Dr. H on 10 sessions, which he found somewhat helpful. Overall, the patient does not feel that he could return back to his usual and customary work capacity as a delivery driver for Frito Lay.,nan\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Is the patient experiencing any headache pain?\nWhat does he mean by 'intermittent radiating pain down his right leg'?\nIs he able to walk without pain?\nCan he drive or use his right arm?\nWhat is the doctor suggesting about a two-level ACDF for C4 and C5?"}

The pathology showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma Nottingham grade II. The tumor was ER positive, PR positive and HER-2/neu negative. On 02/22/08, she underwent a lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The pathology showed a 3.3 cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade I, one sentinel lymph node was negative. Therefore it was a T2, N0, M0 stage IIA breast cancer. Of note, at that time she was taking hormone replacement therapy and that was stopped. She underwent radiation treatment ending in May 2008. She then started on Arimidex, but unfortunately she did not tolerate the Arimidex and I changed her to Femara. She also did not tolerate the Femara and I changed it to tamoxifen. She did not tolerate the tamoxifen and therefore when I saw her on 11/23/09, she decided that she would take no further antiestrogen therapy.

Inflammatory synovitis from the volar radial wrist area.,2. Inflammatory synovitis from the dorsal wrist area.,DRAINS:, None.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:, Patient brought to the operating room. After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff. Routine prep and drape was employed. Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively. Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet. Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure. Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder. A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made. Skin was sharply incised. Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue. Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery. Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches. Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery. Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection. This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule. This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window. After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture. Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene. Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision. An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made. Skin was sharply incised. Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue. Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve. Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum. This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment. EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury. The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone. Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified. This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen. Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis. Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer. Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur. Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained. Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided. Remnants of the scapholunate interosseous which was completely deteriorated were debrided. The joint capsule was closed anatomically with 4-0 PDS and extensor retinaculum was closed with 4-0 PDS. Subcutaneous tissues closed with 4-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.

She cannot stand, sit or turn without severe pain. She has normal knee reflexes. No ankle reflexes. She has bounding tibial pulses. No sensory deficit. She says she knows when she has to void. She has a healed scar in the upper sacral region. There is some bruising around the buttocks but the daughter says that is from her being in bed lying on her back.,PLAN:, My plan is to do a triple-phase bone scan. I am suspecting an infection possibly in the left sacroiliac joint. It is probably some type of bacterium, the etiology of which is undetermined. She has had a normal white count despite her fever.

The patient also has family status complete and desired infertility. The patient was scheduled for elective left spermatocelectomy and bilateral partial vasectomy.,FINDINGS:, At this time of the surgery, significant left-sided spermatocele was noted encompassing almost the entirety of the left epididymis with only minimal amount of normal appearing epididymis remaining.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room. A general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia.,The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for a scrotal approach. A #15 blade was used to make a transverse incision on the left hemiscrotum. Electrocautery was used to carry the incision down into the tunica vaginalis and the testicle was delivered into the field. The left testicle was examined. A large spermatocele was noted. Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect the tissue around the left spermatocele. Once the spermatocele was identified, as stated above, significant size was noted encompassing the entire left epididymis. Metzenbaum scissors as well as electrocautery was used to dissect free the spermatocele from its testicular attachments and spermatocelectomy and left epididymectomy was completed with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used to confirm excellent hemostasis. Attention was then turned to the more proximal aspect of the cord. The vas deferens was palpated and dissected free with Metzenbaum scissors. Hemostats were placed on the two aspects of the cord, approximately 1 cm segment of cord was removed with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery was used to cauterize the lumen of the both ends of vas deferens and silk ties used to ligate the cut ends. Testicle was placed back in the scrotum in appropriate anatomic position. The dartos tissue was closed with running #3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in a horizontal interrupted mattress fashion with #4-0 chromic. Attention was then turned to the right side. The vas was palpated in the scrotum. A small skin incision was made with a #15 blade and the vas was grasped with a small Allis clamp and brought into the surgical field. A scalpel was used to excise the vas sheath and vas was freed from its attachments and grasped again with a hemostat. Two ends were hemostated with hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors. Lumen was coagulated with electrocautery. Silk ties used to ligate both cut ends of the vas deferens and placed back into the scrotum. A #4-0 chromic suture was used in simple fashion to reapproximate the skin incision. Scrotum was cleaned and bacitracin ointment, sterile dressing, fluffs, and supportive briefs applied.

She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva. This started almost a day earlier. She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything. She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5.,OPERATIVE NOTE:, Informed consent was obtained from patient. The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed. Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks. Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg. The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus. There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus. This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots. The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation. Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.,The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation. Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net. Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft. Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out. Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully. The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy. No active bleeding was seen. There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach. As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted.,IMPRESSION:, Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction.

The old right frontal scalp incision was reopened in a curvilinear manner, and the Bactiseal ventricular catheter was identified as it went into the right frontal horn. The distal end of the VA shunt was flushed and tested with heparinized saline, found to be patent, and it was then clamped. Endoscopically, the proximal end was explored and we found debris within the lumen, and then we were able to freely move the catheter around. We could see along the tract that the tip of the catheter had gone into the surrounding tissue and appeared to have prongs or extensions in the tract, which were going into the catheter consistent with partial proximal obstruction. A Portnoy ventricular catheter was endoscopically introduced and then the endoscope was bend so that the catheter tip did not go into the same location where it was before, but would take a gentle curve going into the right lateral ventricle. It flushed in quite well, was left at about 6.5 cm to 7 cm and connected to the existing straight connector and secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.

The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, and alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable to surgery.,FINDINGS:, The patient was found upon excision of the cyst that it contained a large Prolene suture, which is multiply knotted as it always is; beneath this was a very small incisional hernia, the hernia cavity, which contained omentum; the hernia was easily repaired.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of an LMA anesthetic, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion. The puncta of the wound lesion was infiltrated with methylene blue and peroxide. The lesion was excised and the existing scar was excised using an ellipse and using a tenotomy scissors, the cyst was excised down to its base. In doing so, we identified a large Prolene suture within the wound and followed this cyst down to its base at which time we found that it contained omentum and was in fact overlying a small incisional hernia. The cyst was removed in its entirety, divided from the omentum using a Metzenbaum and tying with 2-0 silk ties. The hernia repair was undertaken with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture with simple sutures.

Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion. Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution. A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon. This could later be removed in bishop. A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished. A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock. Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation. Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus. An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament. The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain. Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified. Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement. A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani. The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well. The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse. The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured. The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation. A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston. The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen. It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate. The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate. A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus. Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position. Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph. A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction. The mobility appeared excellent. The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position. The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment. She was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in a stable condition with discharge anticipated later this day to Bishop.

Left reoperative neck dissection levels 1 and the infraclavicular fossa on the left side. Right levels 2 through 5 neck dissection and superior mediastinal dissection of lymph nodes and pretracheal dissection of lymph nodes in a previously operative field.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY:, The patient is a 37-year-old gentleman well known to me with a history of medullary thyroid cancer sporadic in nature having undergone surgery in 04/07 with final pathology revealing extrafocal, extrathyroidal extension, and extranodal extension in the soft tissues of his medullary thyroid cancer. The patient had been followed for a period of time and underwent rapid development of a left and right infraclavicular lymphadenopathy and central neck lymphadenopathy also with imaging studies to suggest superior mediastinal disease. Fine-needle aspiration of the left and right infraclavicular lymph nodes revealed persistent medullary thyroid cancer. Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedures discussed with in detail and the patient elected to proceed with surgery as discussed. The risks included, but not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, lip, tongue, shoulder, weakness, tongue numbness, droopy eyelid, tumor comes back, need for additional treatment, diaphragm weakness, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, others. The patient understood all these issues and did wish to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: ,After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table. The patient was intubated with a number 7 nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube. The eyes were protected with Tegaderm. The patient was rotated to 180 degrees towards the operating surgeon. The Foley catheter was placed into the bladder with good return of urine. Attention then was turned to securing the nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube and this was confirmed to be working adequately. A previous apron incision was incorporated and advanced over onto the right side to the mastoid tip. The incision then was planned around the old scar to be excised. A 1% lidocaine with 1 to 100,000 epinephrine was injected. A shoulder roll was applied. The incision was made, the apron flap was raised to the level of the mandible and mastoid tip bilaterally all the way down to the clavicle and sternal notch inferiorly. Attention was then turned to performing the level 1 dissection on the left. Subsequently the marginal mandibular nerve was identified over the facial notch of the mandible. The facial artery and vein were individually ligated and marginal mandibular nerve traced superiorly and perifascial lymph nodes freed from the marginal mandibular nerve. Level 1A lymph nodes of the submental region were dissected off the mylohyoid and digastric. The submandibular gland was appreciated and retracted laterally. The mylohyoid muscle appreciated. The lingual nerve was appreciated and the submandibular ganglion was ligated. The hypoglossal nerve was appreciated and protected and digastric tunnel was then made posteriorly and the lymph nodes posterior along the marginal mandibular nerve and into the parotid gland were then dissected and incorporated into the specimen for histopathologic analysis. The marginal mandibular nerve stimulated at the completion of this portion of the procedure. Attention was then turned to incising the fascia along the clavicle on the left side. Dissection then ensued along the floor of the neck palpating a very large bulky lymph node before the neck was identified. The brachial plexus and phrenic nerve were identified. The internal jugular vein identified and the mass was freed from the floor of the neck with careful dissection and suture ligation of vessels. Attention was then turned to the central neck. The strap muscles were appreciated in the midline. There was a large firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm that appeared to be superior to the strap musculature. A careful dissection with incorporation of a portion of the sternal hyoid muscle in this area for a margin was then performed. Attention was then turned to identify the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein on the left side. This was traced inferiorly, internal jugular vein to the brachiocephalic vein. Palpation deep to this area into the mediastinum and up against the trachea revealed a 1.5 cm lymph node mass. Subsequently this was carefully dissected preserving the brachiocephalic vein and also the integrity of the trachea and the carotid artery and these lymph nodes were removed in full and sent for histopathologic analysis. Attention was then turned to the right neck dissection. A posterior flap on the right was raised to the anterior border of the trapezius. The accessory nerve was identified in the posterior triangle and traced superiorly and inferiorly. Attention was then turned to identifying the submandibular gland. A digastric tunnel was performed back to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side was incised and the omohyoid muscle was appreciated. The omohyoid muscle was retracted inferiorly. Penrose drain was placed around the inferior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Subsequently the internal jugular vein was identified. The external jugular vein ligated about 1 cm above the clavicle. Palpation in this area and the infraclavicular region on the right revealed a firm irregular lymph node complex. Dissection along the floor of the neck then was performed to allow for mobilization. The transverse cervical artery and vein were individually ligated to allow full mobilization of this mass. Tissue between the phrenic nerve and the internal jugular vein was clamped and suture ligated. The tissue was then brought posteriorly from the trapezius muscle to the internal jugular vein and traced superiorly. The cervical rootlets were transected after the contribution, so the phrenic nerve all the way superiorly to the skull base. The hypoglossal nerve was identified and protected as the lymph node packet was dissected over the internal jugular vein. The wound was copiously irrigated. Valsalva maneuver was given. No bleeding points identified. The wound was then prepared for closure. Two number 10 JPs were placed through the left supraclavicular fossa in the previous drain sites and secured with 3-0 nylon. The wound was closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for platysma, subsequently a 4-0 running Biosyn for the skin, and Indermil.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nDischarge Summary - ATV Accident, ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:, Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:, Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:, None.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, For complete details, please see dictated history and physical by Dr. X dated July 23, 2008. Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident. He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters. The patient denies any loss of consciousness. He was not amnestic to the event. He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated. Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE:, Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture. No other apparent injuries. This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment. The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture. The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture. In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture. In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures. Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse. The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture. A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring. His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication. The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident. A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point. Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed. The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed. His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound. He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor. Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries. However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity. Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia. There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion. There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand. By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well. He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies. He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1. Irrigation and debridement of open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,2. Open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,3. Negative pressure wound dressing (July 23, 2008).,4. Irrigation and debridement of left elbow fracture (July 26, 2008).,5. CT of the brain without contrast (July 24, 2008).,DISPOSITION: ,Home with parents.,INVASIVE LINES:, None.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: ,The patient was instructed that he can return home with his regular diet and he was asked not to do any strenuous activities, move furniture, lift heavy objects, or use his left upper extremity. He was asked to followup with return appointment in one week to see Dr. Y in Orthopedics. Additionally, he was told to call his pediatrician, if he develops any fevers, pain, loss of sensation, loss of pulse, or discoloration of his fingers, or paleness to his hand.discharge summary, humerus fracture, trauma, irrigation and debridement, atv accident, upper extremity, humerus, fracture, orthopedic,\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the presenting diagnosis?\nWhat is the presence or absence of a secondary diagnosis?\nWho treated the patient in the hospital?\nWhat procedures were performed to treat the patient?\nWere invasive lines placed and if so, why?\nWere there any complications during treatment?\nWas there a discharge assessment done for potential side effects of treatment and necessary follow up care with referrals given?"}

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nDietary Consult - Diabetes - 1, SUBJECTIVE:, This is a 28-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for diabetes during pregnancy. Patient reports that she had gestational diabetes with her first pregnancy. She did use insulin at that time as well. She does not fully understand what ketones are. She walks her daughter to school and back home each day which takes 20 minutes each way. She is not a big milk drinker, but she does try to drink some.,OBJECTIVE:, Weight is 238.3 pounds. Weight from last week\u2019s visit was 238.9 pounds. Prepregnancy weight is reported at 235 pounds. Height is 62-3/4 inches. Prepregnancy BMI is approximately 42-1/2. Insulin schedule is NovoLog 70/30, 20 units in the morning and 13 units at supper time. Blood sugar records for the last week reveal the following: Fasting blood sugars ranging from 92 to 104 with an average of 97, two-hour postprandial breakfast readings ranging from 172 to 196 with an average of 181, two-hour postprandial lunch readings ranging from 149 to 189 with an average of 168 and two-hour postprandial dinner readings ranging from 109 to 121 with an average of 116. Overall average is 140. A diet history was obtained. Expected date of confinement is May 1, 2005. Instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes. A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed. The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:, Patient\u2019s basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day. Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day. Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks. The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine. We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most. We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget. We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy. We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars. While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient\u2019s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day. Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis. At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:, Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate. Breakfast: Three carbohydrate servings. Morning snack: One carbohydrate serving. Lunch: Four carbohydrate servings. Afternoon snack: One carbohydrate serving. Supper: Four carbohydrate servings. Bedtime snack: One carbohydrate serving. Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack. Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy. Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals. Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack. Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment: Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.

His previous PSAs were in the 1 range. TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden. After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy. Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision. The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room here. Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done. General anesthesia was induced. The patient was placed in the supine position. The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area. The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes. The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field. Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision. A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus. Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath. The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle. Space of rectus sheath was then entered. The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area. The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected. This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein. Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall. The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally. Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves. An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated. The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation. The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad. The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia. The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments. Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders. A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle. A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis. Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide. Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter. The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra. The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end. The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end. The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety. A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex. The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut. Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue. Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal. Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete. Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia. The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip. Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters. The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate. Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity. Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation. The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion. The rest of the mucosa was then everted. The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure. At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position. Hemostasis was then adequately obtained. FloSeal was applied to the pelvis. The bladder was then irrigated. It was draining pink urine. The wound was copiously irrigated. The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS. The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion. At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications. The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU. Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nPhacoemulsification & Lens Implantation - 4, OPERATION PERFORMED:, Phacoemulsification of cataract and posterior chamber lens implant, right eye., ,ANESTHESIA:, Retrobulbar nerve block, right eye, ,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: ,The patient was brought to the operating room where local anesthetic was administered to the right eye followed by a dilute drop of Betadine and a Honan balloon. Once anesthesia was achieved, the right eye was prepped with Betadine, rinsed with saline, and draped in a sterile fashion. A lid speculum was placed and 4-0 silk sutures passed under the superior and inferior rectus muscles stabilizing the globe. A fornix-based conjunctival flap was prepared superiorly from 10 to 12 o'clock and episcleral vessels were cauterized using a wet-field. A surgical groove was applied with a 69 Beaver blade 1 mm posterior to the limbus in a frown configuration in the 10 to 12 o'clock position. A lamellar dissection was carried anteriorly to clear cornea using a crescent knife. A stab incision was applied with a Superblade at the 2 o'clock position at the limbus. The chamber was also entered through the lamellar groove using a 3-mm keratome in a beveled fashion. Viscoat was injected into the chamber and an anterior capsulorrhexis performed. Hydrodissection was used to delineate the nucleus and the phacoemulsification tip was inserted into the chamber. A deep linear groove was dissected through the nucleus vertically and the nucleus was rotated 90 degrees with the assistance of a spatula through the side-port incision. A second groove was dissected perpendicular to the first and the nucleus was fractured into quadrants. Each quadrant was emulsified under burst power within the capsular bag. The epinuclear bowl was manipulated with vacuum, flipped into the iris plane, and emulsified under pulse power. I&A was used to aspirate cortex from the capsular bag. A scratcher was used to polish the capsule, and Viscoat was injected inflating the capsular bag and chamber. The wound was enlarged with a shortcut blade to 5.5 mm. The intraocular lens was examined, found to be adequate, irrigated with balanced salt, and inserted into the capsular bag. The lens centralized nicely and Viscoat was removed using the I&A. Balanced salt was injected through the side-port incision. The wound was tested, found to be secure, and a single 10-0 nylon suture was applied to the wound with the knot buried within the sclera. The conjunctiva was pulled over the suture, and Ancef 50 mg and Decadron 4 mg were injected sub-Tenon in the inferonasal and inferotemporal quadrants. Maxitrol ointment was applied topically followed by an eye pad and shield. The patient tolerated the procedure and was taken from the operating room in good condition.surgery, retrobulbar nerve block, posterior chamber lens implant, phacoemulsification of cataract, lens implantation, capsular bag, cataract, phacoemulsification, nucleus, capsular, lens, eye\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How does the operation work?\nWhat are the necessary equipment for this operation?\nAre there any risks or side effects of this operation?"}
{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nDiplopia, HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a 53-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents to the clinic for further evaluation of diplopia. He states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in January 2009. He had double vision. He states when he closed each eye, the double vision dissipated. The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour. He was able to drive. However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again. Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe. He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation. He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation. He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm. The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia. Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together. He still does not drive. He also is not working due to the double vision. There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision. More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain. It actually feels like there is pain under his right lid. He denies any dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any other neurological symptoms.,There is a neurology consultation in the computer system. Dr. X saw the patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department. He underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the right side. MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative. He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal. His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.,At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis. He had left gaze diplopia. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal. According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil. There was also right medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities. I do not have the official ophthalmologic consultation available to me today.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, The patient denies any previous past medical history.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nDietary Consult - Gestational Diabetes, SUBJECTIVE:, This is a 38-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for gestational diabetes. Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars. She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart. Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency. She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals. She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home. She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day. She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:, Today's weight: 155.5 pounds. Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds. A diet history was obtained. Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following: fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88. I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes. The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed. Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied. A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:, Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day. Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day. Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns. In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m. We discussed the need for small frequent eating. We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response. We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her. The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars. In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice. We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time. Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake. Her weight loss was discouraged. Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:, The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan. The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day. The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time. The meal plan is as follows: breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings. Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep. Encouraged adequate rest. Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week. If the meal plan reflected does not support slow gradual weight gain, then we will need to add more foods accordingly. This was a one-hour consultation.

She walks her daughter to school and back home each day which takes 20 minutes each way. She is not a big milk drinker, but she does try to drink some.,OBJECTIVE:, Weight is 238.3 pounds. Weight from last week\u2019s visit was 238.9 pounds. Prepregnancy weight is reported at 235 pounds. Height is 62-3/4 inches. Prepregnancy BMI is approximately 42-1/2. Insulin schedule is NovoLog 70/30, 20 units in the morning and 13 units at supper time. Blood sugar records for the last week reveal the following: Fasting blood sugars ranging from 92 to 104 with an average of 97, two-hour postprandial breakfast readings ranging from 172 to 196 with an average of 181, two-hour postprandial lunch readings ranging from 149 to 189 with an average of 168 and two-hour postprandial dinner readings ranging from 109 to 121 with an average of 116. Overall average is 140. A diet history was obtained. Expected date of confinement is May 1, 2005. Instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes. A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed. The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:, Patient\u2019s basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day. Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day. Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks. The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine. We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most. We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget. We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy. We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars. While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patient\u2019s carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day. Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis. At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:, Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate. Breakfast: Three carbohydrate servings. Morning snack: One carbohydrate serving. Lunch: Four carbohydrate servings. Afternoon snack: One carbohydrate serving. Supper: Four carbohydrate servings. Bedtime snack: One carbohydrate serving. Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack. Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy. Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals. Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack. Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment: Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.

Nonetheless, she has a strong family history of colon cancer, and it has been almost four to five years so she wants to have a repeat colonoscopy. I told her that the interval was appropriate and that it made sense to do so. She denies any significant weight change that she cannot explain. She has had no hematochezia. She denies any melena. She says she has had no real change in her bowel habit but occasionally does have thin stools.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, On today's visit we reviewed her entire health history. Surgically she has had a stomach operation for ulcer disease back in 1974, she says. She does not know exactly what was done. It was done at a hospital in California which she says no longer exists. This makes it difficult to find out exactly what she had done. She also had her gallbladder and appendix taken out in the 1970s at the same hospital.

Since then she just says things have changed . She just does not want to go out anymore and just does not feel the same. Also, at the same time, she is having a lot of household stressors with both of her children having ADD and ODD and she feels she does not get enough support from her husband. Her 11-year-old is having a lot of trouble at school and she often has to go there to take care of problems.,In this setting, she has been having multiple cardiovascular complaints including chest pains, which feel like cramps and sometimes like a dull ache, which will last all day long. She is also tender in the left breast area and gets numbness in her left hand. She has also had three spells of falling, she is not really clear on whether these are syncopal, but they sound like they could be as she sees spots before her eyes.

These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her. She feels anxious and worried. She does not think she can take any more pain. She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help. They seem to be intensifying her pain. She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine. So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her. We discussed this at length. I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide. She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality. She had Hysterectomy in the past.,MEDICATIONS:, Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily.,ALLERGIES:, Compazine and Allegra.,OBJECTIVE:,Vital Signs: Weight: 140 pounds.

She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete. The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back. As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her. She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today\u2019s instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday\u2019s appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend. I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out.,PROCEDURE:,: She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine. We waited about 20 minutes. The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed. The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder. She seemed to tolerate it moderately well. She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it.

He also has a longstanding history of neck pain. His neurological examination is normal. He has an MRI that shows some degenerative changes. I do believe that his symptoms are probably referable to his neck. However, I do not think that they are severe enough for him to undergo surgery at this point in time. Perhaps another course of physical therapy may be helpful for him. I probably would not recommend anymore invasive procedure, such as a spinal stimulator, as this pain really is minimal. We could still try to treat him with neuropathic pain medications.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1. I scheduled him to return for an EMG and nerve conduction studies to determine whether there is any evidence of nerve damage, although I think the likelihood is low.,2. I gave him a prescription for Neurontin. I discussed the side effects of the medication with him.,3.

She had undergone workup previously with my associate, Dr. X as well as by Endocrinology, and showed this to be a nonfunctioning mass. Due to the size, the patient was advised to undergo an adrenalectomy and she chose the laparoscopic approach due to her multiple pulmonary comorbidities.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:, Showed multiple intraabdominal adhesions in the anterior abdominal wall. The spleen and liver were unremarkable. The gallbladder was surgically absent.,There was large amount of omentum and bowel in the pelvis, therefore the gynecological organs were not visualized. There was no evidence of peritoneal studding or masses. The stomach was well decompressed as well as the bladder.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:, After informed consent was obtained from the patient, she was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia. She was placed on a bean bag and secured to the table. The table was rotated to the right to allow gravity to aid in our retraction of the bowel.,Prep was performed. Sterile drapes were applied. Using the Hassan technique, we placed a primary laparoscopy port approximately 3 cm lateral to the umbilicus on the left. Laparoscopy was performed with ___________. At this point, we had a second trocar, which was 10 mm to 11 mm port. Using the non-cutting trocar in the anterior axillary line and using Harmonic scalpel, we did massive lysis of adhesions from the anterior abdominal wall from the length of the prior abdominal incision, the entire length of the abdominal incision from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus. The adhesions were taken down off the entire anterior abdominal wall.,At this point, secondary and tertiary ports were placed. We had one near the midline in the subcostal region and to the left midline and one at the midclavicular line, which were also 10 and 11 ports using a non-cutting blade.,At this point, using the Harmonic scalpel, we opened the white line of Toldt on the left and reflected the colon medially, off the anterior aspect of the Gerota's fascia. Blunt and sharp dissection was used to isolate the upper pole of the kidney, taking down some adhesions from the spleen. The colon was further mobilized medially again using gravity to aid in our retraction. After isolating the upper pole of the kidney using blunt and sharp dissection as well as the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to dissect the plane between the upper pole of the kidney and lower aspect of the adrenal gland. We were able to isolate the adrenal vein, dumping into the renal vein, this was doubly clipped and transected. There was also noted to be vascular structure of the upper pole, which was also doubly clipped and transected. Using the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to continue free the remainder of the adrenal glands from its attachments medially, posteriorly, cephalad, and laterally.,At this point, using the EndoCatch bag, we removed the adrenal gland through the primary port in the periumbilical region and sent the flap for analysis. Repeat laparoscopy showed no additional findings. The bowel was unremarkable, no evidence of bowel injury, no evidence of any bleeding from the operative site.,The operative site was irrigated copiously with saline and reinspected and again there was no evidence of bleeding. The abdominal cavity was desufflated and was reinspected. There was no evidence of bleeding.,At this point, the camera was switched to one of the subcostal ports and the primary port in the periumbilical region was closed under direct vision using #0 Vicryl suture. At this point, each of the other ports were removed and then with palpation of each of these ports, this indicated that the non-cutting ports did close and there was no evidence of fascial defects.,At this point, the procedure was terminated.

He was placed into a well-molded splint after reduction was performed in the emergency department. Further x-rays showed further distal fragment dorsal angulation that progressively worsened and it was felt that surgical intervention was warranted. All risks, benefits, expectations, and complications of the surgery were explained to the patient in detail, and he signed the informed consent for ORIF of the right wrist.,PROCEDURE:, The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operative table. The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well. The right upper extremity had a well-padded tourniquet placed on the right arm, which was insufflated and maintained for 40 minutes at 250 mmHg pressure. The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A 5-cm incision was made over the flexor carpi radialis of the right wrist. The skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the deep tissue was retracted, blunt dissection was performed down to the pronator quadratus. Sharp dissection was performed through the pronator quadratus after which a tissue elevator was used to elevate this tissue. Next, a reduction was performed placing the distal fragment into appropriate alignment. This was checked under fluoroscopy, and was noted to be adequately reduced and in appropriate position. An Acumed Accu-lock plate was placed along the volar aspect of the distal radius. This was checked under AP and lateral views with C-arm, noted to be in appropriate alignment. A 3.5-mm cortical screw was placed through the proximal aspect of the plate, positioned it into position. Two distal locking screws were placed along the plate itself. The screws were checked under AP and lateral views noting the fracture fragment was well aligned and appropriately reduced with the 2 screws being placed into appropriate position with the appropriate length as well as not being intraarticular. Four more screws were placed along the distal aspect of the plate and 2 more proximal along the plate. All locking screws placed into position and had excellent purchase into the bone or had excellent fixation into the plate and maintained the alignment of the fracture. AP and lateral views were taken of these screw placements again. None of these screws were into the joint and all had appropriate length into the dorsal cortex. Two more 3.5 fully threaded cortical screws were placed along the proximal aspect of the plate and had excellent bicortical purchase. AP and lateral views were taken of the wrist once again showing that this was appropriate reduction of the fracture as well as appropriate placement of the screws. Bicortical purchase was appreciated and no screws were placed into the joint. The wound itself was copiously irrigated with saline and Kantrex after which the subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 nylon stitch; 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the wound site after which sterile dressing was placed as well as the volar splint.

Other medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia.,MEDICATIONS:,As outpatient,,1. Atenolol 25 mg once a day.,2. Altace 2.5 mg once a day.,3. Zocor 20 mg once a day.,4. Flecainide 200 in the morning and 100 in the evening.,5. Coumadin as directed by our office.,ALLERGIES:, TO MEDICATIONS ARE NONE. HE DENIES SHRIMP, SEA FOOD OR DYE ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY:, He has a nephew who was his sister's son who passed away at age 22 reportedly from an MI, but was reported to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well. The patient has previously met with the electrophysiologist, Dr. X, at General Hospital and it sounds like he had a negative EP study.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, The patient does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol nor drink any caffeine. No use of illicit drugs. He has been married for 22 years and he is actually accompanied throughout today's cardiology consultation by his wife. He is not participating in regular exercises now because he states since starting flecainide, he has gotten sluggish. He is employed as an attorney and while he states that overall his mental stress is better, he has noted more recent mental stress this past weekend when he was taking his daughter back to college.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, He denies any history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi. There are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had a formal sleep study.,PHYSICAL EXAM:, Blood pressure 156/93, pulse is 100, respiratory rate 18. On general exam, he is a pleasant overweight gentleman, in no acute distress. HEENT: Shows cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic. He has moist mucosal membranes. Neck veins are not distended. There are no carotid bruits. Visible skin warm and perfused. Affect appropriate. He is quite oriented and pleasant. No significant kyphoscoliosis on recumbent back exam. Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly. No wheezes. No egophony. Cardiac Exam: S1, S2. Regular rate, controlled. No significant murmurs, rubs or gallops. PMI is nondisplaced. Abdomen is soft, nondistended, appears benign. Extremities without significant edema. Pulses grossly intact.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA:, Initial ECG shows atrial flutter.,IMPRESSION:, Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so. I have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of. After in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was I primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as I did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of CVA, although we cannot really make that null. The patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis. I invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE: ,The patient received a total of 7 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the Medical Center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions. The patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure. After the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using lollipop posterior patch with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy. There was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead EKG.,IMPRESSION:, Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22. We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed. I had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, Dr. X, at Electrophysiology Unit at General Hospital and I will be planning to place a call for Dr. X myself. Again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and I suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.,I had previously discussed the case with Dr. Y who is the patient's general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient's bedside regarding our findings.nan\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is happening in the body physically to cause the disruption of atrial fibrillation?\nWhat diagnoses does the patient have and what are his risks if he were to be cardioverted?\nWhat are the alternatives to cardioversion and why was not it recommended as an option for this patient?\nHow often does the patient experience atrial fibrillation or a recurrence of it?"}
{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nAngina - Consult, HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is a 68-year-old woman whom I have been following, who has had angina. In any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her. I advised her to call 911, which she did. While waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain. By the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well.,PAST CARDIAC HISTORY:, The patient has been having arm pain for several months. She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia. I had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker. However, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room. On 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80% mid LAD lesion, circumflex normal, and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area. The decision was made to transfer her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel. She underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with I believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08. She had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild. Yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin. This is her usual angina. She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, Longstanding hypertension, CAD as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder.,MEDICATIONS:,1.

She is divorced and lives alone and is a retired laboratory technician from Cornell Diagnostic Laboratory.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, She denies a history of stroke, cancer, vomiting up blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi, cholelithiasis, asthma, emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculosis, home oxygen use or sleep apnea, although she has been told in the past that she snores and there was some question of apnea in 05/08. No morning headaches or fatigue. No psychiatric diagnosis. No psoriasis, no lupus. Remainder of the review of systems is negative x14 systems except as described above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL: She is a pleasant elderly woman, currently in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS: Height 4 feet 11 inches, weight 128 pounds, temperature 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure 142/70, pulse 47, respiratory rate 16, and O2 saturation 100%,HEENT: Cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.

INR is 0.89, PTT 20.9, white blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 31 and it was 35 on 08/15/08, and platelet count 257,000.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN: ,The patient is a 68-year-old woman with exertional angina, characterized with arm pain, who underwent recent left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention and has now had recurrence of that arm pain post stenting to the left anterior descending artery and it may be that she is continuing to have collateral insufficiency of the right coronary artery. In any case, given this unstable presentation requiring three sublingual nitroglycerin before she was even pain free, I am going to admit her to the hospital and there is currently no evidence requiring acute reperfusion therapy. We will continue her beta-blocker and I cannot increase the dose because she is bradycardic already. Aspirin, Plavix, valsartan, Lipitor, and Norvasc. I am going to add Imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before, and we will rule out MI, although there is a little suspicion. I suppose it is possible that she has non-cardiac arm pain, but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker, so we can maximize beta-blocker use for anti-anginal effect. My concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia, not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention, which was severely stenotic and she does have normal LV function. She will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis, Claritin for allergies, and Detrol LA for urinary incontinence.,Total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nProstatectomy - Nerve Sparing, PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,Prostate cancer.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Prostate cancer.,OPERATION PERFORMED:, Radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:, 450 mL.,REPLACEMENT:, 250 mL of Cell Saver and crystalloid.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,INDICATIONS OF SURGERY:, This is a 67-year-old man with needle biopsy proven to be Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma in one solitary place on the right side of the prostate. Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy. Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1. Infection.,2. Bleeding.,3. Incontinence.,4. Impotence.,5. Injury to the adjacent viscera.,6. Deep venous thrombosis.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room. Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty. The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique. A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained. A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade. The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie. Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly. A Bookwalter retractor was then placed. The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected. Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy. The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors. Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection. Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device. The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion. With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie. Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra could then be easily identified. Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors. This exposed the blue Foley catheter. Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture. Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly. The Foley catheter was then removed. This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally. Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally. This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate. Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat. The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat. The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate. Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved. The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps. The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only. Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time. The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized. The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side. The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method. Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy. Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles. This was developed without any difficulty. Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected. The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis. About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed. The tip was left behind. Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected. This was performed on the left side and then the right side. This completely freed the prostate. The prostate was sent for permanent section. The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures. Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature. The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures. The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck. This was performed by using a French ***** needle. A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down. A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon. The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty. A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region. All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure. The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS. Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.

Right thoracotomy.,2. Extensive lysis of adhesions.,3. Right lower lobectomy.,4. Mediastinal lymphadenectomy.,ANESTHESIA:, General.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:, The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. After an adequate general anesthesia was given, she was placed in the left lateral decubitus and the right chest was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. Lateral thoracotomy was performed on the right side anterior to the tip of the scapula, and this was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue. The latissimus dorsi muscle was partially transected and then the serratus was reflected anteriorly. The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space. A retractor was placed and then extensive number of adhesions between the lung and the pleura were lysed carefully with sharp and blunt dissection. The right lower lobe was identified. There was a large mass in the superior segment of the lobe, which was very close to the right upper lobe, and because of the adhesions, it could not be told if the tumor was extending into the right upper lobe, but it appeared that it did not. Dissection was then performed at the lower lobe of the fissure, and a GIA stapler was placed through here to separate the tumor from the upper lobe including a small segment of the upper lobe with the lower lobe. Then, dissection of the hilum was performed, and the branches of the pulmonary artery to the lower lobe were ligated with #2-0 silk freehand ties proximally and distally and #3-0 silk transfixion stitches and then transected. The inferior pulmonary vein was dissected after dividing the ligament, and it was stapled proximally and distally with a TA30 stapler and then transected. Further dissection of the fissure allowed for its completion with a GIA stapler and then the bronchus was identified and dissected. The bronchus was stapled with a TA30 bronchial stapler and then transected, and the specimen was removed and sent to the Pathology Department for frozen section diagnosis. The frozen section diagnosis was that of non-small cell carcinoma, bronchial margins free and pleural margins free. The mediastinum was then explored. No nodes were identified around the pulmonary ligament or around the esophagus. Subcarinal nodes were dissected, and hemostasis was obtained with clips. The space below and above the osseous was opened, and the station R4 nodes were dissected. Hemostasis was obtained with clips and with electrocautery. All nodal tissue were sent to Pathology as permanent specimen. Following this, the chest was thoroughly irrigated and aspirated. Careful hemostasis was obtained and a couple of air leaks were controlled with #6-0 Prolene sutures. Then, two #28 French chest tubes were placed in the chest, one posteriorly and one anteriorly, and secured to the skin with #2-0 nylon stitches. The incision was then closed with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl pericostal stitches. A running #1 PDS on the muscle layer, a running 2-0 PDS in the subcutaneous tissue, and staples on the skin.

The patient was placed in the supine position under spinal anesthesia with a Foley catheter in place and she was prepped and draped in the usual manner. A low abdominal transverse skin incision was constructed and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue through the anterior rectus fascia. Bleeding points were snapped and coagulated along the way. The fascia was opened transversally and was dissected sharply and bluntly from the underlying rectus muscles. These were divided in the midline revealing the peritoneum, which was opened vertically. The uterus was in mid position. The bladder flap was incised elliptically and reflected caudad. A low transverse hysterotomy incision was then constructed and extended bluntly. Amniotomy revealed clear amniotic fluid. A live born vigorous male infant was then delivered from the right occiput transverse position. The infant breathed and cried spontaneously. The nares and pharynx were suctioned. The umbilical cord was clamped and divided and the infant was passed to the waiting neonatal team. Cord blood samples were obtained. The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was eventrated for closure. The edges of the uterine incision were grasped with Pennington clamps and closure was carried out in standard two-layer technique using 0 Vicryl suture with the second layer imbricating the first.

Liposuction of the supraumbilical abdomen.,ANESTHESIA:, General.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:, The patient is a 31-year-old white female who previously has undergone latissimus dorsi flap and implant, breast reconstruction. She now had lateralization of the implant with loss of medial fullness for which she desired correction. It was felt that mobilization of the implant medially would provide the patient significant improvement and this was discussed with the patient at length. The patient also had a small dog ear in the flank area on the right from the latissimus flap harvest, which was to be corrected. She had also had liposuction of the periumbilical and infraumbilical abdomen with desire to have great improvement superiorly, was felt to be a candidate for such. The above-noted procedure was discussed with the patient in detail. The risks, benefits and potential complications were discussed. She was marked in the upright position and then taken to the operating room for the above-noted procedure.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:, The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position. Following adequate induction of general LMA anesthesia, the chest and abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The supraumbilical abdomen was then injected with a solution of 5% lidocaine with epinephrine, as was the dog ear. At this time, the superior central scar was then excised, dissection continued through the subcutaneous tissue, the underlying latissimus muscle until the capsule of the implant was reached. This was then opened. The implant was removed and placed on the back table in antibiotic solution. Using Bovie cautery, the medial capsule was released and undermining was then performed with release of the muscle to the level of the proposed medial projection of the breast. The inframammary fold medially was secured with 2-0 PDS suture to create greater takeoff point at this level which in the upright position and using a sizer produced a good form. The lateral pocket was diminished by series of 2-0 PDS suture to provide medialization of the implant. The implant was then placed back into the submuscular pocket with much improved positioning and medial fullness. With this completed, the implant was again removed, antibiotic irrigation was performed. A drain was placed and brought out through a separate inferior stab wound incision and hemostasis was confirmed. The implant was then replaced and the wound was then closed in layers using 2-0 PDS running suture on the muscle and 3-0 Monocryl Dermabond subcuticular sutures. The 2.5 cm dog ear was then excised into and including the subcutaneous tissue, even contouring was achieved and this was closed with two layers using 3-0 Monocryl suture. Using a #3 cannula, a superior umbilical incision, liposuction was carried out into the supraumbilical abdomen, removing approximately 40 to 50 mL of fat with improved supraumbilical contours. This was closed with 6-0 Prolene suture. The patient was placed in a compressive garment after treating the incision with Dermabond, Steri-Strips and antibiotic ointment around the drain site and umbilicus. A Kerlix dressing and a surgical bra was placed to the chest area. A compressive garment was placed.

He underwent a second circumcision with a general anesthetic approximately 8 to 9 days ago. The mother states that on Thursday, he developed fairly significant swelling, scrotum was also swollen, the suprapubic region was swollen, and he was having a purulent discharge and a fairly significant fever to 102 to 103. He was seen at Hospital, transferred to Children's Hospital for further care. Since being hospitalized, his cultures apparently have grown Staph but is unknown yet whether it is methicillin-resistant. He has been placed on clindamycin, and he is now currently afebrile and with marked improvement according to the mother. I was requested a consultation by Dr. X because of the appearance of penis. The patient has been voiding without difficulty throughout.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, The patient has no known allergies. He was a term delivery via vaginal delivery. Surgeries; he has had 2 circumcisions. No other hospitalizations. He has had no heart murmurs, seizures, asthma, or bronchitis.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, A 14-point review of systems was negative with the exception of the penile and scrotal cellulitis and the surgeries as mentioned. He also had an ear infection about 1 to 2 weeks before his circumcision.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, The patient lives with both parents and no siblings. There are smokers at home.,MEDICATIONS:, Clindamycin and bacitracin ointment. Also Bactrim.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: Weight is 14.9 kg.,GENERAL: The patient was sleepy but easily arousable.,HEAD AND NECK: Grossly normal. His neck and chest are without masses.,NARES: He had some crusted nares; otherwise, no other discharge.,LUNGS: Clear.,CARDIAC: Without murmurs or gallops.,ABDOMEN: Soft without masses or tenderness.,GU: He has a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad, and he is quite a large child in any event; however, there were no signs of erythema. There was some induration around the penis; however, there were no signs of active infection. He has a buried appearance of the penis after recent circumcision with a normal appearing glans. The tissue itself, however, was quite dull and is soft or readily retractable at this time. The scrotum was normal, and there was no erythema, there was no tenderness. Both testes were descended without hydroceles.,EXTREMITIES: He has full range of motion of all 4 extremities.,SKIN: Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact.,BACK: Normal.,IMPRESSION/PLAN:, The patient had a recent circumcision with a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad but also has a penile and suprapubic cellulitis. This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities. I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad. I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day. I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely. Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so. He has a scheduled followup appointment with his urologist and he should keep that appointment or followup sooner if there is any other problem arising.urology, newborn circumcision, suprapubic fat pad, penile cellulitis, penile swelling, cellulitis, penis, penile, suprapubic, circumcision,\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the symptoms of penile cellulitis?\nIs penile cellulitis rare in children?\nWhat is the treatment for penile cellulitis?\nHas the child been treated for his penile swelling and other complications from the surgery?"}

A 6-French arterial sheath was placed in the usual fashion. Left and right coronary angiograms were then performed in various projections after heparin was given 2000 units intraaortic. The right coronary artery was difficult to cannulate because of its high anterior takeoff. This was nondominant. Several catheters were used. Ultimately, an AL1 diagnostic catheter was used. A pigtail catheter was advanced across the aortic valve. Left ventriculogram was then done in the RAO view using 30 mL of contrast. Pullback gradient was obtained across the aortic valve. Femoral angiogram was performed through the sheath which was above the bifurcation, was removed with a Perclose device with good results. There were no complications. He tolerated this procedure well and returned to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1. Right coronary artery: This has an unusual high anterior takeoff. The vessel is nondominant, has diffuse mild-to-moderate disease.,2. Left main trunk: A 30% to 40% distal narrowing is present.,3. Left anterior descending: Just at the ostium of the vessel and up to and including the bifurcation of the first large diagonal branch, there is 80 to 90% narrowing. The diagonal is a large vessel about 3 mm in size.,4. Circumflex: Dominant vessel, 50% narrowing at the origin of the obtuse marginal. After this, there is 40% narrowing in the AV trunk. The small posterior lateral branch has diffuse mild disease and then the vessel gives rise to a fairly large posterior ventricular branch, which has 70% ostial narrowing, and then after this the posterior descending has 80% narrowing at its origin.,5. Left ventriculogram: Normal volume in diastole and systole. Normal systolic function is present. There is no mitral insufficiency or left ventricular outflow obstruction.,DIAGNOSES,1. Severe complex left anterior descending and distal circumflex disease with borderline, probably moderate narrowing of a large obtuse marginal branch. Dominant circumflex system. Severe disease of the posterior descending. Mild left main trunk disease.,2. Normal left ventricular systolic function.,Given the complex anatomy of the predominant problem which is the left anterior descending; given its ostial stenosis and involvement of the bifurcation of the diagonal, would recommend coronary bypass surgery.

There was no evidence of cystocele or rectocele. On urodyanamcis, the patient has significant overactivity of the bladder. The patient was tried on over three to four different anticholinergic agents such as Detrol, Ditropan, Sanctura, and VESIcare for at least one month each. The patient had pretty much failure from each of the procedure. The patient had less than 20% improvement with anticholinergics. Options such as continuously trying anticholinergics, continuation of the Kegel exercises, and trial of InterStim were discussed. The patient was interested in the trial. The patient had percutaneous InterStim trial in the office with over 70% to 80% improvement in her urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence.

The patient was placed in prone position. A pillow was placed underneath her pelvis area to slightly lift the pelvis up. The patient was awake, was given some MAC anesthesia through the IV, but the patient was talking and understanding and was able to verbalize issues. The patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% was applied on the right side near the S3 foramen. Under fluoroscopy, the needle placement was confirmed. The patient felt stimulation in the vaginal area, which was tapping in nature. The patient also had a pressure feeling in the vaginal area. The patient had no back sensation or superficial sensation. There was no sensation down the leg. The patient did have __________, which turned in slide bellows response indicating the proper positioning of the needle. A wire was placed. The tract was dilated and lead was placed. The patient felt tapping in the vaginal area, which is an indication that the lead is in its proper position. Most of the leads had very low amplitude and stimulation. Lead was tunneled under the skin and was brought out through an incision on the left upper buttocks. Please note that the lidocaine was injected prior to the tunneling. A pouch was created about 1 cm beneath the subcutaneous tissue over the muscle where the actual unit was connected to the lead. Screws were turned and they were dropped. Attention was made to ensure that the lead was all the way in into the InterStim. Irrigation was performed after placing the main unit in the pouch. Impedance was checked. Irrigation was again performed with antibiotic irrigation solution. The needle site was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.

She also has a septal deviation mid posterior to the left compromising greater than 70% of her nasal airway.,PROCEDURE: ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the skin was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the region of the anterior portion of the nasal septum. Approximately 10 cc total was used.,A #15 blade and the Freer elevator were used to help make a standard hemitransfixion incision. A mucoperichondrial flap was carefully elevated, and the junction with the cartilaginous bony septum was separated with the Freer elevator. The bony deflection was removed using Jansen-Middleton forceps. The cartilaginous deflection was created by freeing up the inferior attachments to the cartilaginous septum, placing it more on the midline maxillary crest. The initial incision was placed in its anatomical position and secured with a 4-0 nylon suture for stabilization effect.,Attention then was directed toward the left side. Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected in the region of the anterior portion of the left middle turbinate and uncinate process and polyps. Approximately 10 cc total was used. The polyps were removed using the Richards essential shaver to help identify the middle turbinate and uncinate process better. The uncinate process was removed systematically superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting forceps. Next, the maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting forceps and showed polypoid accumulation in the mucosal disease on its opening site. The sinus linings were edematous but did not have any polyps in the inferior, lateral, or superior aspects.,The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were entered primarily and dissected with the Richards essential shaver followed by the use of a 30-degree endoscope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral dissection. Bright mucosal disease and small polypoid accumulations were noted through the sinuses also. The inferior turbinates had some polypoid changes on them also and showed marked mucosal irritation and hypertrophy. The mucosal polypoid accumulations were cleared using the Richards essential shaver. The turbinate was partially resected from mucosally but with good shape to it. It was not desirable to remove it in its entirety. Any obvious bleeding points along the edge were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus.,The same procedure and findings were noted on the right side with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine injected into the anterior portion of the right middle turbinate, polyps, and uncinate process; 10 cc total were used. The polyps were removed. The Richards essential shaver was used to allow better exposure of the uncinate process. The uncinate process was removed superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting side-biting forceps.,Next, a maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting and side-biting forceps and showed all plate accumulations there also. The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were then entered primarily and dissected with Richards essential shaver followed by the use of the 30-degree scope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral resection. The inferior turbinates showed mucosal disease, polypoid accumulations, and changes. These were removed using the Richards essential shaver followed by a submucosal resection of the hypertrophied portion of the turbinate.,Any obvious bleeding points were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus.

I agreed. I saw her in my office and she was cooperative for full mouth set of radiographs in my office and a clinical examination. This clinical and radiographic examination revealed no dental caries; however, she was in need of a good dental cleaning.,OPERATIVE PREPARATION: ,The patient was brought to Hospital Day Surgery accompanied by her mother. I met with them and discussed the needs of the child, types of restoration to be performed, and the risks and benefits of the treatment as well as the options and alternatives of the treatment. After all their questions and concerns were addressed, they gave their informed consent to proceed with the treatment. The patient's history and physical examination was reviewed. Once she was cleared by Anesthesia, she was taken back to the operating room.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: ,The patient was placed on the surgical table in the usual supine position with all extremities protected. Anesthesia was induced by mask. The patient was then intubated with a nasal endotracheal tube and the tube was stabilized. The head was wrapped and the eyes were taped shut for protection. An Angiocath was previously placed in preop. The head and neck were draped in sterile towels, and the body was covered with lead apron and sterile sheath. A moist continuous throat pack was placed beyond tonsillar pillars. Plastic lip and cheek retractors were then placed. Preoperative digital intraoral photographs were taken. No digital radiographs were taken in the operating room, as I stated before I had a full set of digital radiographs taken in my office. A prophylaxis was then performed using a Prophy cup and fluoridated Prophy paste after scaling and replaning was done. She presented with moderate calculus on the buccal surfaces of her maxillary, first molars and lower molars. She did not require any restorative dentistry.,Upon the conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris. The original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided. Postoperative clinical photographs were taken. The continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction and visualization.

He is currently in the phase of his therapy where he has developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency. He presents after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now has a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury. His CT imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia. He had previously been intubated and taken to the Intensive Care Unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy. The images were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this was a left-sided condition. He was fixed in a three-point headrest. His scalp was shaved and prepared with Betadine, iodine and alcohol. We made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region. The scalp was reflected. A single bur hole was made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole was created. After completing the bur hole flap, the dura was opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural was peeled away from the brain. The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up. We investigated the subdural space forward and backward as we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding as we close to the midline. After we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura was reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline. We placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates. The scalp was reapproximated, and the patient was awakened and taken to the CT scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there was no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment. Given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.,I was present for the entire procedure and supervised this.

This area was then sterilely prepped and draped.,Evoked potential monitoring and sensory potentials were carried out throughout the case and no changes were noted.,A horseshoe shaped flap was based on the right and then brought across to the midline. This was opened and hemostasis obtained using Raney clips. The skin flap was retracted medially. Two burr holes were made and were carefully connected. One was placed right over the sinus and we carefully then removed a rectangular shaped bone flap. Hemostasis was obtained. Using the neuronavigation, we identified where the tumor was. The dura was then opened based on a horseshoe flap based on the medial sinus. We retracted this medially and carefully identified the brain. The brain surface was discolored and obviously irritated consistent with the tumor.,We used the stereotactic neuronavigation to identify the tumor margins.,Then we used a bipolar to coagulate a thin layer of brain over the tumor. Subsequently, we entered the tumor. The tumor itself was extremely hard. Specimens were taken and send for frozen section analysis, which showed probable metastatic carcinoma.,We then carefully dissected around the tumor margins.,Using the microscope, we then brought microscopic magnification and dissection into the case. We used paddies and carefully developed microdissection planes all around the margins of the tumor superiorly, medially, inferiorly, and laterally.,Then using the Cavitron, we cored out the central part of the tumor. Then we collapsed the tumor on itself and removed it entirely. In this fashion, microdissection and magnification resection of the tumor was carried out. We resected the entire tumor.

She has been having difficulty since that time with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain. She states this happens quite frequently and can even happen when she uses topical prednisone for her ears or for her eyes. She presents today for screening colonoscopy, based on the same.,OPERATIVE COURSE:, The risks and benefits of colonoscopy were explained to the patient in detail. She provided her consent. The morning of the operation, the patient was transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. In divided doses, she was given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl. A digital rectal examination was performed, after which time the scope was intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure. This was intubated fairly easily; however, the patient was clearly in some discomfort and was shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she was provided. In truth, the pain she was experiencing was out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure. While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I was concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse. In addition, she was really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and was putting us all at some risk. For this reason, the procedure was aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure. She was noted to have some pools of stool. This was suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ova and parasites, and fecal leukocytes. Additionally, random biopsies were performed of the colon itself. It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, as I would have liked to have taken biopsies of the terminal ileum. However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome. The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home.,PLAN:, She needs to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsies and cultures.

But the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the US government could not sue the firms under legislation drawn up to counteract Mafia infiltration of business. The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. They also say they have already met many of the government's demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998.

The report suggests 69% of UK firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online. Mr O'Brien said UK businesses were sprinting forward in ICT use, but that there were more challenges ahead. The report, carried out independently by consultants Booz Allen Hamilton and HI Europe, placed the UK third behind Sweden and Ireland for business use of ICT.\n\nIt showed British business brought greater maturity to their ICT use, by using broadband in increased numbers, bringing ICT into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. Mr O'Brien said: \"The increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that UK companies are embracing the opportunities that ICT can bring. \"It is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years.\" The government would play its part in \"cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish\", Mr O'Brien said. The \"clear message\" the report sends is that effective use of ICT can bring real improvements in business performance for all business.\n\n\"However, we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the UK is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy,\" he added.

A report by the Commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks. Chairman Sir Archy Kirkwood said: \"If the agency cannot be rescued, then it must be replaced.\"\n\nThe committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250,000 cases have yet to be processed. It warned that it could be five years before the CSA was \"fit for purpose\", describing it as \"a failing organisation\" and \"in crisis\" with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations. The report urged the CSA to draw up contingency plans, including the \"abandonment option\", to be presented to Parliament by Easter, in case the CS2 computer system could not be made to work.\n\nAnd responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped, Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I certainly wouldn't rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system. \"But I think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isn't going to work.\"\n\nThe MPs launched their inquiry into the CSA's performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was building up. The MPs found the \u00a3456m system from American IT giant EDS was \"nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied, disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate\". Faced with the committee's criticism, the government has suspended its plan to cut the agency's staff by 25%. The CSA has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.\n\nIt is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than \u00a3720m, while a further \u00a3947m has been designated as \"unrecoverable\".\n\nMichelle, a mother of twins, said she had not received a penny of the \u00a357 a week she should be receiving from her ex-partner and had faced an \"on-going battle\" with the CSA.

Mr Blunkett is taking legal action to gain access to Mrs Quinn's two-year-old son. She denies he is Mr Blunkett's. The interview with BBC Radio Sheffield was made before allegations he fast-tracked a visa for Mrs Quinn's nanny. The allegations, which he has denied, are being investigated by Sir Alan Budd.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nMPs' murder sentence concern\n\nMurder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea, says a new MPs' report.\n\nThe influential Commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer. The MPs also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs. They say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders. Committee chairman John Denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse.\n\n\"The committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor.\" At present judges, when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence, can reduce the tariff - the minimum term they must serve - if the defendant pleads guilty. But although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims' relatives are unhappy. In July this year Amanda Champion's killer, James Ford, pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years - it would have been longer had he denied the charge.\n\nAmanda's uncle, Lewis Champion, told the BBC News website Ford did not deserve any credit for his plea, saying: \"Nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence.\" MPs criticised Home Secretary David Blunkett last year for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty.\n\nThe measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after Mr Blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the Criminal Justice Bill.\n\nAs a result, says the committee, the government may need to re-legislate to \"remove ambiguity\" over how murderers should be sentenced. It is also calling on the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf, to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in September to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. The committee said the plans had not reflected the \"public disquiet\" expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers. Lord Woolf's Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime. As a result murderers who face a 15-year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police.\n\nMr Denham believes the SGC should reconsider its proposals to reflect Parliament's wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence. He said: \"We want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder, reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances.\" But a spokesman for the Home Office defended the proposals. He said: \"By making express provision for murder tariffs in the Criminal Justice Act, Parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences. \"We stand by the provisions in the Act that cover guilty plea discounts, which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial.\"\n\nShadow home secretary David Davis echoed criticisms of the way Mr Blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules. \"There is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government's claim to be tough on crime,\" he said.

But the Conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours' PE within school for 75% of pupils by 2006 - are unrealistic.\n\nThe latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport, with activities such as yoga and Tai Chi being options. Launching the initiative, Mr Blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl Waverley Sports College in Southwark, south London. He said: \"You've got to bring back school sport. It's got to be done differently than it was 30 or 40 years ago. It's still very, very important.\"\n\nEarlier, Education Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC News there were at least three areas which needed \"a coherent framework\" and \"dedicated funding\". These were training for PE teachers, establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as inter-school competitions. He added the government had originally pledged \"for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education\" a week. The proportion was currently at 62%, and the government was hoping this would rise to 85% by 2008 and 100% by 2010. The money for the initiative will come from a new \u00a3500m fund.\n\nThe \u00a3500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400. But the Conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. Shadow spokesman for sport Hugh Robertson said: \"I suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer.\" He said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports, saying that an \"anti-competitive sport agenda\" had been pursued in recent years.

But before doing so, he insisted he still trusted Mr Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book. Labour MPs have warned against disunity and Tory leader Michael Howard may well take up the theme in the Commons. The Tories have already accused the prime minister and his chancellor of behaving like \"schoolboys squabbling in a playground\".\n\nMichael Howard is likely to want to capitalise further on the spat when he goes head-to-head with the prime minister in the Commons. At a campaign poster launch on Tuesday, Mr Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Mr Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor.\n\nLater this week the prime minister is due to set out the themes of his party's next election manifesto, which for the past two polls have been drawn up by the chancellor. Mr Brown, meanwhile, is visiting Tanzania, Mozambique and Kenya to highlight the plight of many Africans hit by Aids, war and famine - issues which Mr Blair has also spoken out on.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nStudent 'inequality' exposed\n\nTeenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says.\n\nThe Higher Education Funding Council for England said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000. But the percentage of poorer students \"hardly changed at all\", said its chief executive, Sir Howard Newby. Increasingly more women than men went to university, while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference.\n\nThe Hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10%. Participation at constituency level ranged from 69% in Kensington and Chelsea, 65% in the City of London and Westminster and 62% in Sheffield Hallam, down to 10% in Bristol South and Leeds Central and 8% in Nottingham North and Sheffield Brightside.\n\nSir Howard said the report highlighted the \"entrenched divisions\" between rich and poor areas, but added it was a social as much as an educational problem. He told BBC News: \"We know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well. In fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds. \"The issue is, I think, one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people.\"\n\nHe said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late. Instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said. But while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge, there were some encouraging findings, he added.\n\nTuition fees and student loans in England and Wales - and the different fee regime in Scotland - did not seem to have affected the choices of young people, even the poorest. The report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994. In the poorest areas, the gap was 30% in women's favour and growing faster than anywhere else. The Higher Education Minister, Kim Howells, said: \"We are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas.\" Higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nBlair 'said he would stand down'\n\nTony Blair promised Gordon Brown he would stand down before the next election, a new book about the chancellor claims.\n\nBut the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the Cabinet, according to the book.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nHow political squabbles snowball\n\nIt's become commonplace to argue that Blair and Brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.\n\nBut this analysis in fact gets it wrong. It's not just children who fight - adults do too. And there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. The key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they'd be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.\n\nEach participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. Their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (In the case of Mr Blair and Mr Brown, successive books are published, ensuring the issues never die.) Now this isn't because the participants are stupid - it's actually each individual behaving entirely rationally, given the incentives facing them. Indeed, there's even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. Nothing as obscure as \"post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory\" which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.\n\nIt's often referred to as the \"prisoner's dilemma\", based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. The story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime, and are locked up in separate cells. But the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them, to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. Without a confession, the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.\n\nClearly the prisoners' best strategy is to keep their mouths shut, and take the short sentence, but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. He tells each prisoner separately, that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they'll be let off their crime. And he tells them that if they don't confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they'll get life. Now, if you are prisoner confronted with this choice, your best bet is to confess. If your partner doesn't confess, you'll get off completely. And if your partner does confess, you'd better confess to ensure you don't get life. The result is of course, both prisoners confess, so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. Both prisoners' individual logic was to behave that way, even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. Don't worry if you don't entirely follow it - you can to look it up on Google, where there are 283,000 entries on it.\n\nThe prisoners' dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. It is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively, but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.\n\nA cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both Russia and America would be better off with just a few arms, rather than a lot of arms. But as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other, an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms, results in arms levels that are too high. What economics tells us is that once you're in a prisoners' dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it's hard to escape the perverse logic of it. It's no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms, or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. Somehow, the incentives have to change.\n\nIn the case of the Labour Party, if you believe the rift between Blair and Brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest, Solomon's wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. Every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments, solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. An example, is the famous rule that \"one divides, the other chooses\" as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. In the case of an apparently endless argument, if you want it to come to an end, you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. The cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing, or one more book for that matter, has to exceed the benefit of having the last word, and getting your point in. If the rest of the party can enforce that, they'll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why does the argument not end?\nWhy does everyone want to have the last word?\nWhat is game theory?\nWhat is the solution for this type of problem?"}

In his speech, Mr Blair contrasted a reformed Labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound Tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.\n\n\"I believe that the Tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of Conservative government.\" Mr Blair added: \"They, the Conservatives have learned nothing.\" By contrast, he said, New Labour had listened to its electorate and changed.\n\nMr Blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. \"So now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back.

The proposals follow a recommendation last year by elections watchdog the Electoral Commission. \"The government intends to legislate, when parliamentary time allows, to lower the age,\" said Mr Leslie, who was elected in 1997 at the age of 24. Even if the move does go ahead it is unlikely it will be in place before the next general election, widely predicted for May.\n\nThe announcement from Mr Leslie - who was elected in 1997 in a formerly safe Tory seat - prompted calls for a lowering of the voting age to 16. The Votes at 16 alliance said it was a good thing to \"engage people\" by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective. \"Candidacy affects only politicians. The voting age affects millions of younger people,\" said spokesman Alex Folkes. \"We would hope that the government will table a bill that is broad enough to allow for amendments to be brought to test support for a reduction in the voting age.\"\n\nCurrently candidates in both local and national votes must be 21 while the voting age is 18. That is because the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1969 but laws dating from 1695 which determine the current voting age stayed in place. Irish republican Bernadette Devlin was one of just a handful of 21-year-olds elected to Parliament in the 20th century winning a seat in 1969. But the youngest is understood to have been Tory Edward Turnour, who won the 1904 Horsham by-election aged 21 and 144 days and served in Parliament for 47 continuous years.

It is currently arguing against an offer from Swiss Xstrata, which the firm raised to A$8.4bn last week after WMC said it was an undervaluation. Now reports say that the Australian government is against the deal.\n\nTrade Minister Mark Vaile has said that the bid may be \"against the national interest\". Mr Vaile, who was quoted in the Australian Financial Review, compared Xstrata's attempt to take over WMC to a similar bid by oil giant Shell for Australia's Woodside Petroleum in 2001. The bid was thrown out by Treasurer Peter Costello on national interest grounds. WMC's interests in uranium deposits were a contributing factor, Mr Vaile said. WMC itself, however, has no objection in principle to being bought out, having spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target - as long as the price is right. Its stellar performance in 2004 has been built on sky-high prices for metals.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nUK rebate 'unjustified' - Chirac\n\nFrench president Jacques Chirac has called the UK's \u00a33bn rebate from the European Union \"unjustified\".\n\nSpeaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the EU would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. Earlier Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. He said it remained justified because less EU farm money came to the UK.\n\nMr Chirac told reporters in Brussels: \"One can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the British cheque. It can no longer be justified. It was from the past.\" But a UK Government official responded: \"Even with the rebate, the UK pays two and a half times more than France contributes to the EU budget. Without it we would pay 14 times as much as France. \"There can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.\"\n\nThe 25-member EU is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013, with the bloc's Luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a June summit. Earlier Conservative Graham Brady said the rebate was a \"crucial test\" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for Britain. EU Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.\n\nThe UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the European Commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. Mr Straw has said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. Shadow Europe minister Mr Brady said: \"I believe it is essential that Britain keeps the rebate and I think it's a crucial test of how firmly the British government is prepared to stand up for Britain internationally in Europe.\n\n\"The UK is already one of the biggest net contributors to the EU .\" The foreign secretary meanwhile said the \"justice\" of the rebate remained. \"We have one of the lowest net receipts of any EU country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency. \"That continues to be the case.\"\n\nUK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman said the rebate was \"set in stone\" and there was no reason to negotiate about it. \"It is extraordinary to do it at this time, just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the EU. If we lose our rebate as well, the British taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that I think everyone will go off the European project.\" EU leaders are holding talks in Brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish European economy. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is meeting his EU counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the European Constitution. The plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. Critics - including Germany and France - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in Eastern Europe, undercutting large EU economies and undermining social protections. There are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern European countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in Germany.\n\nMr Straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate. \"European countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods,\" he said. \"What we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.\" Britain's low unemployment meant there was less \"neurosis\" about people coming from eastern European countries. \"In countries like Germany and France, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in,\" he said.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What specific contribution to the EU budget is being talked about?\nWhat questions might the observer ask about this contribution?\nWhy are French president Jacques Chirac and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw talking about changing the UK's rebate?\nHow does UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman feel about France, Germany, France and Germany's desires to change or eliminate the UK's rebate?\nWhat message could Mr. Chirac send to those who want the rebate eliminated by eliminating it himself first in a negotiation?"}

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nAbortion not a poll issue - Blair\n\nTony Blair does not believe abortion should be an election issue, arguing it is a matter for individual conscience.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesman set out Mr Blair's view after the top Catholic in England and Wales backed Michael Howard's stance on abortions. The Tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are \"tantamount to abortion on demand\". The prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law.\n\nMr Blair's spokesman said: \"The Catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the Cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context.\" His words came as Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor, the Archbishop of Westminster, backed Mr Howard's stance and distanced himself from Labour. In a statement, he said abortion was a \"very key issue\", saying: \"The policy supported by Mr Howard is one that we would commend, on the way to a full abandonment of abortion.\"\n\nCardinal O'Connor claimed Labour had \"developed\" the notion that it was the natural party of Catholics, but he said: \"We are not going to suggest people support one particular party.\" The Family Planning Association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later. More than 180,000 women in England and Wales had terminations last year, of which fewer than 1% were carried out between 22 and 24 weeks.\n\nIn the Cosmopolitan interview Mr Howard said: \"I believe abortion should be available to everyone, but the law should be changed. \"In the past I voted for a restriction to 22 weeks and I would be prepared to go down to 20.\" All three main parties say the issue is one for each MP's conscience, rather than one where there is a party-wide policy. Mr Howard stressed his views were his personal views. Shadow home secretary David Davis said he understood Mr Howard had been signalling that a Conservative government would allow a Commons vote on the issue. Mr Blair and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy also gave their views during interviews, conducted as part of the magazine's \"High Heeled Vote\" campaign.\n\nMr Blair, who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the Catholic faith despite regularly taking communion, said abortion was a \"difficult issue\". \"However much I dislike the idea of abortion, you should not criminalise a woman who, in very difficult circumstances, makes that choice. \"Obviously there is a time beyond which you can't have an abortion, and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue.\" Mr Kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean \"I don't know what I would do now\".

Anne Weyman, chief executive of the Family Planning Association, asked: \"What is the benefit to women, or to the potential child, of forcing a woman to have a baby?\" Anti-abortion group the Pro-Life Alliance \"congratulated\" Mr Howard on his new stance, but said it did not go far enough.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the main ideologies in this passage?\nWhat's Tony Blair's stance on abortion?\nWhat does Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor think about abortion?\nHow does the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cardiff feel about abortion?\nDoes Anne Weyman believe abortion should be legalized for all women?"}
{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nProfile: Gordon Brown\n\nThe ultimate prize of 10 Downing Street may continue to elude him but, as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget, Gordon Brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.\n\nHe reached that milestone last June, when he overtook David Lloyd George, who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. How much longer Mr Brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: \"those who fail and those who get out in time.\") There are rumours he will be moved to the Foreign Office if Labour wins the general election. But, for now, Mr Brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.\n\nGordon Brown was born in Glasgow on 20 February 1951, the son of a Church of Scotland Minister in the small Fife town of Kirkcaldy. At 12, he was canvassing for Labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in Scotland. He achieved a first class degree in history from Edinburgh University, where he went on to complete a PhD. His early career was spent lecturing, working in television and making a name for himself in the Scottish Labour Party.\n\nHis first attempt to enter Westminster, for Edinburgh South in 1979, was thwarted by the present Tory spokesman on foreign affairs, Michael Ancram. But in 1983, he took Dunfermline East, a new constituency including Rosyth naval base, pit villages and coastal towns.\n\nEntering Westminster, he came to share an office with the newly elected MP for Sedgefield, Tony Blair. Within four years, Mr Brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. He became shadow chancellor under John Smith's leadership in 1992. After the death of leader John Smith in 1994 he stood aside, agreeing to give Tony Blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the Granita restaurant in Islington.\n\nThe other part of the deal, that Mr Blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor, is the stuff of Westminster legend. Mr Blair's supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns - and even a television film - have been devoted to the alleged deal. But if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, Mr Brown continued his devotion to politics. During the 1997 election campaign, he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day, six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning.\n\nThis dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by Mr Brown's former girlfriend of five years, Princess Marguerite of Romania, the eldest daughter of ex-King Michael of Romania, who said a relationship with him was \"politics, politics, politics\".\n\nIf that was true then, Mr Brown, who married PR executive Sarah Macaulay in 2000, changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002. Their daughter Jennifer died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, 10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely. A year later, in October 2003, the couple had a son - John - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. A trip to Africa earlier this year, to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations, also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side.\n\nThe ideological differences between Mr Brown and Mr Blair remain relatively modest. The chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the NHS and is seen as being more \"Old Labour\" than Mr Blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. But their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the New Labour project. Yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict, with Mr Brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger Downing Street neighbour over the succession. Mr Blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful Mr Brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his Budget until the last possible minute. After a recent run of negative headlines, Labour MPs took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering, for the good of the party. Events like this, and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues, make it impossible to dismiss the Brown/Blair feud as just journalistic hearsay, cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of Westminster. How much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question.\n\nA truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by Blairite Alan Milburn being brought in over the head of Mr Brown to run the election campaign. But with the Tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that Mr Brown - using the Budget as a springboard - is to revitalise Labour's campaign. Amid all this it is easy to forget that Mr Brown remains the man most likely to succeed Mr Blair as Labour leader. There may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including Mr Milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that Mr Brown can. And Mr Blair's decision to name his own retirement date has at least given Mr Brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister's intention to \"serve a full third term\" if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is Gordon Brown's nationality?\nWhat is his first and last name?\nWho are the two people he shares a history with - Tony Blair and Princess Marguerite of Romania?\nWhat is the city where he was born?\nWhen did he enter Westminster?\nWhat is his current job title in regards to the budget?\nHow much longer will Gordon Brown stay chancellor if Labour wins the general election?\nWhy has Mr Brown been Chancellor for so long in modern times and who was David Lloyd George before him as Chancellor of Modern Times?"}

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nFeta cheese battle reaches court\n\nA row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe Danish and German governments are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole rights to use the name. The Commission's decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to Italian Parma ham and French Champagne. But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside Greece.\n\nThe Commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave \"protected designation of origin\" status to feta cheese made in Greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.\n\nFrom 2007 onwards, Greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in Europe must find another name to describe their products. The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years. \"In our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese,\" Hans Arne Kristiansen, a spokesman for the Danish Dairy Board, told the BBC. Denmark is Europe's second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece. It is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in Denmark such as brie. \"It would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation,\" Mr Kristiansen said. \"That is just one of the costs.\"\n\nThe case will also have a major impact on Britain's sole feta producer, Yorkshire company Shepherds Purse Cheeses.\n\nJudy Bell, the company's founder, said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product. \"If we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation,\" she said. \"We have never tried to pull the wool over anyone's eyes - it's very clear from the label that it's Yorkshire feta.\" The original decision was a victory for Greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nRadcliffe tackles marathon tasks\n\nPaula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\n\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \n\nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\n\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \n\nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\n\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \n\nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \n\nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.\n\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\" \n\n\n\nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\n\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\"\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the most likely outcome for Radcliffe in the race?\nWhat are her chances of winning or losing?\nHow will she know whether she has won or lost at the end of the race?\nWhat are possible consequences for Radcliffe if she wins or loses?\nWhere does Radcliffe want to finish and how much does it matter to her if she does not make this goal?\nWill Radcliffe's old running success factor into how people might react to her should she fail in New York City?\nIf Radcliffe fails, will this be a setback that makes or breaks her as an athlete?"}

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nRecord fails to lift lacklustre meet\n\nYelena Isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record, but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in Birmingham.\n\nAnd hey, there are not many meets that go by without the Russian breaking a world record.\n\nApparently, Isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and I would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time. Athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can, and I would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition. Mind you, every time she breaks the record she gets $30,000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it. World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes. She looked good and was very positive. Agnes Samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season. Yes, Samaria let Kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race, so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly. My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships, but she just hasn't convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in Madrid. He started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. Jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish.\n\nIt would have been nice to see what Mark Lewis-Francis could have done in the final, if only he hadn't got himself disqualified. He was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage, but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. My view is you're meant to go when the gun goes and not before. And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. Having said that, Mark is looking in much better shape. But I haven't seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests France's Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans. From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.\n\nSomething else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Championships. Scotland's Lee McConnell is probably going to run too, so we have a real prospect of a medal. From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don't think the pace-making was great. Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money. She had a go but just could not hang in there. We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. But he has only just come over from the USA, so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape. As for Kenenisa Bekele, he was well beaten by Markos Geneti. But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season. It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How many world records did Yelena Isinbayeva break during the meet?\nWhat is standing in between Kelly Holmes and a European Indoor Championship medal?\nWhat are the standings of Mark Lewis-Francis, Jason Gardener, Agnes Samaria, Meseret Defar, Bernard Lagat, Kenenisa Bekele?\nWhy were conditions not optimal for distance runners?"}

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nMan Utd stroll to Cup win\n\nWayne Rooney made a winning return to Everton as Manchester United cruised into the FA Cup quarter-finals.\n\nRooney received a hostile reception, but goals in each half from Quinton Fortune and Cristiano Ronaldo silenced the jeers at Goodison Park. Fortune headed home after 23 minutes before Ronaldo scored when Nigel Martyn parried Paul Scholes' free-kick. Marcus Bent missed Everton's best chance when Roy Carroll, who was later struck by a missile, saved at his feet.\n\nRooney's return was always going to be a potential flashpoint, and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. And Rooney's every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. Everton started brightly and Fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from Bent near the goal-line. But that was the cue for United to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a Goodison Park pitch that was cutting up. Fortune gave United the lead after 23 minutes, rising to meet Ronaldo's cross from eight yards after the Portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless Gary Naysmith. United dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances, and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. Mikel Arteta played a superb ball into the area but Bent, played onside by Gabriel Heintze, hesitated and Carroll plunged at his fee to save. United almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when Ronaldo's low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off Tony Hibbert, but Martyn dived to save brilliantly. And Martyn came to Everton's rescue three minutes later when Rooney's big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through, but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. But there was nothing Martyn could do when United doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. Scholes' free-kick took a deflection, and Martyn could only parry the ball out for Ronaldo, who reacted first to score easily. Everton's problems worsened when James McFadden limped off with an injury. And there may be further trouble ahead for Everton after goalkeeper Carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. Rooney's desperate search for a goal on his return to Everton was halted again by Martyn in injury-time when he outpaced Stubbs, but once again Martyn denied the England striker.\n\n- Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson: \"It was a fantastic performance by us. In fairness I think Everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out. \"The boy Ronaldo is a fantastic player.

But Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hinted he may be back early. He said: \"There is a chance he could be involved at Everton but we'll just have to see how he comes through training.\" The 28-year-old has been training in Holland and Ferguson said: \"Ruud comes back on Tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is. \"The training he has been doing in Holland has been perfect and I am very satisfied with it.\" Even without Van Nistelrooy, United made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at Manchester City on Sunday. But they will be boosted by the return of the Dutch international, who is the club's top scorer this season with 12 goals. He has not played since aggravating the injury in the 3-0 win against West Brom on 27 November. Ferguson was unhappy with Van Nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury.

Opposite number Ronald Waterreus had been Rangers' hero, saving superbly from Craig Bellamy and John Hartson. Striker Novo secured victory, lobbing Douglas with eight minutes remaining. It ended Celtic's 11-game unbeaten run at home in Old Firm derbies and gave Rangers manager Alex McLeish his first victory at the home of his Glasgow rivals. Celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch, including twice already this season. They started confidently, with new signing Bellamy, on loan from Newcastle United, given his Celtic debut up front with Wales international colleague John Hartson and Chris Sutton dropping into midfield. It took Bellamy just four minutes to threaten, taking on Marvin Andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by Waterreus at the second attempt. He had an even better chance after Hartson dispossesed Sotiris Kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat. But Waterreus did well to beat away Bellamy's disappointing low drive from 16 yards. Waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to Hartson just inside the box and the Dutch goalkeeper made a brave block. It was an Old Firm return for Barry Ferguson as McLeish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past Hibernian. But Rangers found Celtic harder to break down and Douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break. Dado Prso turned inside Neil Lennon only for the Celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful 18-yard drive. A great defensive header by Andrews prevented Hartson pouncing from five yards out. Hartson foxed Vignal at the edge of the Rangers box, but the striker's shot on the turn was again beaten away by Waterreus. Rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and Vignal, collecting a knock back from Fernando Ricksen, broke the deadlock, Douglas somehow letting the Frenchman's dipping drive slip through his grasp.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nWhy few targets are better than many\n\nThe economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world's leading economy by 2010.\n\nBut the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe doesn't become a global economic laggard. They are also about ensuring Europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of Asia, India and China, as well as with the economic might of the United States. That's why there was a tone of urgency in the report, out on Wednesday, by the former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok. Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception. His conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed.\n\nLisbon risks becoming a \"synonym for missed objectives and failed promises\", his report said. \"The status quo is not an option.\"\n\nAt risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society Europe has built, it said. The report comes at a time when Europe's competitive position is waning. The EU's economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next. While there has been growth in overall employment rates in Europe, productivity lags behind that of the US. But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far. That has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years.\n\nAs Mr Kok's report noted: \"The ink had scarcely dried on the [Lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.\" \"The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit.\"\n\nThe circumstances weren't conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000. Neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development, money needed if the EU was to meet its target of becoming a so-called \"knowledge-based economy\". \"The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,\" said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels-based citizen action group. \"What you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change. You find trade unions fighting change. But also the employers' associations. \"Even though they tell you they're in favour of change, many are actually pushing for less competition, more subsidy and less free market activity.\"\n\nBut part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago. Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the Wim report. Economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion, and even safety at sea. The agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised.\n\n\"Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing,\" the Kok report said. \"Everybody is responsible and thus no one.\" That's why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. It also recommends that the European Commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they're taking towards meeting the targets, effectively \"naming, shaming and faming\". \"Rhetoric and delivery don't necessarily go hand in hand,\" Mr Kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report. \"We don't have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another.\"\n\nOn one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy. The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. In that sense, the Lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth. \"It's very ambitious,\" said John Palmer, political director at the European Policy Centre, a Brussels-based think-tank. \"This is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do. It's going to require quite new and innovative policies.\" But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality. For example, it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce. But it doesn't say how companies should be convinced to do this. It will be up to the incoming president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, to adopt Mr Kok's recommendations and press them on EU governments. Mr Barroso has said that the EU's competitiveness will be his top priority. He expects his five-year term in office to be judged on Europe's success in meeting the Lisbon agenda.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why were the original targets set for the Lisbon summit too broad and all encompassing?\nWhat are Wim Kok's recommendations for dealing with the severity of these Lisbon goals and challenges?\nHas there been an agreement from EU member states to these targets?"}

The first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly, pushing referee Alan Wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee Paul Norman. And the second charge is for using threatening words and/or behaviour to a match official during the 1-1 draw.\n\nPaolo di Canio was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee Paul Alcock over in a Premiership game between Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal in 1998. Prutton will be joined at Wednesday's hearing by Saints boss Harry Redknapp, who believes that the FA will throw the book at his player.

The Nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11,740.60 points, with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen. Weaker exports, normally the engine for Japan's economy in the face of weak domestic demand, had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking GDP. Only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline.

Neil Mellor gave Liverpool the lead before half-time from Milan Baros' pass before the Czech added a third after rounding Shay Given on the hour. Newcastle then had Lee Bowyer sent off for two bookable offences. Liverpool brought back Luis Garcia after a hamstring injury, while Newcastle were forced to draft in Kluivert after Craig Bellamy was a late withdrawal with a back injury sustained in the warm-up. And Garcia should have crowned his return with a goal inside the opening minute when he took a pass from Baros but shot wildly over the top from eight yards. Olivier Bernard was only inches away from giving Newcastle the lead after 20 minutes, when he fired just wide from a free-kick 25 yards out. But Souness's side did go ahead 11 minutes later in highly controversial circumstances.\n\nKluivert looked suspiciously offside when Kieron Dyer set Bowyer free, but the Dutchman was then perfectly placed to score from six yards. The lead lasted three minutes, with Liverpool back on terms as Bramble headed Gerrard's corner into his own net under pressure from Sami Hyypia. And Liverpool were ahead after 37 minutes when Baros slid a perfect pass into Mellor's path for the youngster to slip a slide-rule finish into Given's bottom corner. Garcia's finishing was wayward, and he was wasteful again in first-half injury time, shooting tamely at Given after good work by Xabi Alonso. Any hopes of a Newcastle recovery looked to be snuffed out on the hour when a brilliant turn and pass by Harry Kewell set Baros free and he rounded Given to score. Jermaine Jenas then missed a glorious chance to throw Newcastle a lifeline, shooting over from just eight yards out from Shola Ameobi's cross.

Under-pressure coach Bernard Laporte has made four changes, with Yannick Nyanga, the debutant Julien Laharrague, Aurelien Rougerie and Yannick Jauzion coming into the side.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nItaly 8-38 Wales\n\nWales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\n\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\n\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\n\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\n\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\n\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\n\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\n\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\n\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\n\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\n\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\n\nAndrew Cole (Australia).\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are Wales's positions of the game?\nWhat is Wales's goal in this match and how does it wish to achieve this goal?\nHow does Italy feel about its position in the game, what goals does it have?\nWhat changes should England be making after watching this game (if any)?\nWhat should Ireland do to get ahead of Wales (if they needed to)?"}

Rusedski had match point at 6-5 in the second set tie-break after Henman double-faulted, but missed his chance and Henman rallied to clinch the set. The British number one then showed his superior strength to take the decider and earn his sixth win over Rusedski.

Williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games.

At the same time, finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to French growth. \"[Oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,\" he said. World oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand.\n\nAnalysts said French companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. \"[The unemployment figures] show the main problem of the French economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment,\" said Marc Touati, an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires. \"Politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late.\" Obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in France than in many other European economies. Many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours.

So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.\n\nThe system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said Sun's chief operating officer Jonathan Schwartz. \"Why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?\" he asked in a webcast launching Sun's quarterly Network Computing event in California. The company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil, gas and financial services industries.\n\nSome of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, Sun said. Mr Schwartz ran a demonstration of the service, showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. Hundreds of servers were used simultaneously, working on the problem for a few seconds each.\n\nAlthough it only took a few seconds, the experiment cost $12 (\u00a36.30) because it had used up 12 hour's worth of computing power. The Sun Grid relies on Solaris, the operating system owned by Sun. Initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nPiero gives rugby perspective\n\nBBC Sport unveils its new analysis tool Piero at the Wales v England rugby union match on Saturday. But what does it do and how does it work?\n\nPicture the scene - Wales are camped on the England line in the dying seconds of the Six Nations' opening match. A ball is flung out to winger Shane Williams who crosses to score the winning try for Wales. But the England players are incensed - arguing that the pass was forward and the try should not stand. In the past, sports fans would be left debating the validity of the try for days and weeks to come. But BBC Sport's new tool Piero could end discussions in minutes.\n\nPiero, named after the Italian painter and pioneer of perspective Piero della Francesco, creates a virtual stadium in which virtual players can be tracked from almost any angle. Viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom, giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts. The technology has been created by BBC Research and Development for BBC Broadcast and BBC Outside Broadcasts. BBC Sport is the first client to start using the system. \"In order to keep audiences growing and growing... we need to work closely with people who create technology and innovation to bring sport to life,\" said Andrew Thompson, the BBC's head of development, new media and sports news. \"We want to appeal to core fans - to give them more analysis, more detail, more definitive answers about key passages of play.\" Piero works by taking telemetric data from fixed camera positions and sending that data inside the video signal to a PC which can then render the information into 3D graphics.\n\nThe more cameras using Piero, the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into 3D models. \"It allows us to tell the story of a passage of play, tracking individual players across the field, looking at tactics,\" said Andy Townsend, from BBC Broadcast.\n\nAn operator can manipulate the information and provide almost real-time replays of incidents, as well as more in-depth analysis. The \"virtual camera\" can focus on virtually any aspect of the pitch, giving viewers an insight into action that the camera normally cannot see. Piero also provides a wealth of statistical detail - from the length of kicks, to the length of a run of an individual player and the height of a lift at any lineout.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nBlind student 'hears in colour'\n\nA blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.\n\nVictor Wong, a graduate student from Hong Kong studying at Cornell University in New York State, had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. To study \"space weather\" Mr Wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. A number of solutions were tried, including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in Braille. Mr Wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.\n\n\"The images have three dimensions and I had to find a way of reading them myself,\" Mr Wong told the BBC News website. \"For the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - I felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images.\" He tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. In order to have an exact reference to the screen, a pen and tablet device is used. The software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. Mr Wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally. \"If I took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it, it wouldn't work that well.\"\n\nMr Wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a \"colour memory\" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. \"As the notes increase in pitch I know the colour's getting redder and redder, and in my mind's eye a patch of red appears.\" The colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially, and Mr Wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nConcern over RFID tags\n\nConsumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops, a survey says.\n\nMore than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags, which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low. The survey of consumers in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini. The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology. The tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.\n\nMore than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. Fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that RFID tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. Ard Jan Vetham, Capgemini's principal consultant on RFID, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology. \"Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. \"With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point.\" He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. They are also in use as a passcard for the M6 Toll in the Midlands, in the UK. Mr Vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that RFID tags could be read from a distance. He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. At least once consumer group - Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (Caspian) - has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nDigital guru floats sub-$100 PC\n\nNicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (\u00a353).\n\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\n\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\n\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nTough rules for ringtone sellers\n\nFirms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all UK phone networks.\n\nThe rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. The first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. The rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.\n\nIn the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. But fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone.\n\n\"If you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services,\" he said. To combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. This tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. Mr Flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. Websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. \"What made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently,\" said Mr Flynn. \"People did not know they were being offered a subscription service.\" \"We saw potential for substantial consumer harm here,\" he added.\n\nThe swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. The drafting of the new rules was led by the Mobile Entertainment Forum and the UK's phone firms. \"Everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct,\" said Andrew Bud, regulatory head of the MEF and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox.\n\n\"It's all about transparency,\" he said. \"Consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it.\" \"The consumer has a right to be protected,\" he said. Christian Harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. \"The groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out,\" he said. The new rules came in to force on 15 January and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. Some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said Mr Flynn. Also, said Mr Flynn, Vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. \"We have quite draconian contracts with firms,\" he said. \"We do not have to say why. We can just cut them off.\" Under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal \"stop\" command sent via text message. He said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. \"The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality,\" said Mr Flynn.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How will this code of conduct improve service provision?\nWhat caused the recent spike in content subscriptions from mobile phone users?\nAre consumers who have subscribed to these services vulnerable or at risk?\nWhat is the extent of consumer harm?\nHow did the drafting of the new rules help to stop potential abuse by companies that sell content for mobile phones?"}
{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nChina 'to overtake US net use'\n\nThe Chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the US in less than three years, says a report.\n\nChina's net users number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country's 1.3 billion people. Market analysts Panlogic predicts that net users in China will exceed the 137 million US users of the net by 2008. The report says that the country's culture will mean that Chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations.\n\nAlready net use in China has a very different character than in many Western nations, said William Makower, chief executive of Panlogic. In many Western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. By contrast in China workplace machines are relatively rare. This, combined with the relatively high cost of PCs in China and the time it takes to get phone lines installed, helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in China. Only 36% of Chinese homes have telephones according to reports. \"Net usage tends to happen in the evening,\" said Mr Makower, \"they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233;.\" \"Its fundamentally different usage to what we have here,\" he said.\n\nNet use in China was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country's eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. The net is key to helping Chinese people keep in touch with friends, said Mr Makower. Many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes. What people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of Chinese life. For instance, said Mr Makower, credit cards are rare in China partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt. \"The most popular way to pay is Cash-On-Delivery,\" he said, \"and that's quite a brake to the development of e-commerce.\" The arrival of foreign banks in China, due in 2006, could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare, said Mr Makower. But if Chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on Western ways of living. \"A large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar,\" he said. \"Generally it's more difficult for the government to be able to control it.\" \"Its real value is as an open window onto what's happening elsewhere in the world,\" he said. Government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages Chinese people would not see anywhere else. Familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet. \"It's a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it,\" said Mr Makower.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "The \"Chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the US in less than three years\"\nHow much does the population of China use the internet?

Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch, with prices ranging from \u00a319 to \u00a329. More than 2.8 million DS consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the US and Japan at the end of 2004. Rival Sony has said it will launch its first handheld console, the PSP, in the US and Europe before the end of March. The PSP is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market, despite Sony's assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers.\n\nThe 15 games available on the European launch date will include Nintendo's Super Mario 64 DS, as well as titles from third-party developers such as Ubisoft's Rayman DS.\n\nMore than 120 games are in development for the new console, Nintendo has said. The DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance, allowing the earlier machine's back catalogue of 700 games to be played. Additionally, a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the DS, with a \"download play\" option which allows a group to play against each other, even if just one person owns a copy. Other features include a short-range messaging application called Pictochat, and a built-in microphone which is used in Sega's launch title Project Rub. Nintendo has also announced a media adapter, which will allow the console to play music and video on the move.\n\nThe launch price of \u00a399 (149 euros) compares favourably with the US price of $149, according to John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine. \"It's a very, very competitive price point. There are some innovative features, and Nintendo has created quite a buzz,\" he says. \"However, the line-up of games could have been stronger. Everyone wanted to see the eight-player Mario Kart DS, for example.\"\n\nMr Houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the Nintendo DS and Sony's new PSP, with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. \"The PSP is a sexy bit of kit, but Sony's attitude to the PSP has been very understated in Europe, so far,\" Mr Houlihan said. The worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004, according to industry analysts Screen Digest.\n\nIn the past, games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in Europe than in other parts of the world. However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company was \"pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the US and European launch\". \"Europe is an extremely important market for Nintendo,\" Mr Iwata added.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nNet regulation 'still possible'\n\nThe blurring of boundaries between TV and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog Ofcom has said.\n\nContent on TV and the internet is set to move closer this year as TV-quality video online becomes a norm. At a debate in Westminster, the net industry considered the options. Lord Currie, chairman of super-regulator Ofcom, told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. At the debate, organised by the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA), Lord Currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.\n\n\"The challenge will arise when boundaries between TV and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves,\" he said. Adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate TV content or self-regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion.\n\nSome studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, and the technology opens the door to TV content delivered over the net. More and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. BT has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as BSkyB, ITV and the BBC. Head of the division, Andrew Burke, spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. \"How risque can I be in this new age? With celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners, surely I can push it to the limit,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, he said, if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it, then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. Internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the Law Commission dubbed them \"mere conduits\" back in 2002. This defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. The level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. Richard Ayers, portal director at Tiscali, said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. Huge changes are afoot in 2005, he predicted, as companies such as the BBC offer TV content over the net. The BBC's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as EastEnders and Top Gear will make net TV mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions, he said.\n\nOne of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee, said Mr Ayers. As inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said MP Richard Allan, Liberal Democrat spokesman on IT. Mr Allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of \"impossible to regulate\" and \"just apply offline laws online\". In fact, instead of seeing regulation brought online, the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all TV content. After Lord Currie departed, the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. \"If content is on-demand, consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them, then it is the consumers' choice to watch it.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nHome phones face unclear future\n\nThe fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species.\n\nResearch by handset maker Nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45 million people in the UK, Germany, US and South Korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile.\n\nThe Nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter, between mobiles and to friends. In the UK 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile. However, when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared. In the US and Germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds. In all the countries where interviews were carried out, older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile. Women aged 50 or above almost never use a mobile phone, the research found.\n\nThe move to mobile was most pronounced in South Korea where 65% of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile. 18% said they would not get a landline if they moved house.\n\nMany of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the \"cosiness\" of making a call there. Nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap, reliable and providing good call quality. The survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless. Some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nPutting a face to 'Big Brother'\n\nLiterally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets.\n\nImagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour, and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. Basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist. Together with speech and voice recognition systems, they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. Some of these ideas have been showcased at the London's Science Museum, as part of its Future Face exhibition.\n\nOne such avatar is Jeremiah. It is a virtual man, which you can download for free and install in your computer.\n\nHis creator, Richard Bowden, lecturer at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing at the University of Surrey, refers to Jeremiah as \"him\", rather than it. \"Jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. He is very childlike, he likes visual stimulus,\" he told the BBC News website. \"When he sees children running and laughing and waving at him, he smiles at them. If you ignore him, he gets angry. If you leave, he gets sad. And you can also even surprise him.\" Jeremiah is not actually intelligent. It works on vision, reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system. It is not able to talk or to hear you, at least not yet. The Surrey team is already working on Jeremiah's next version, that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: Finn the fish. \"I am interested in the interaction, providing the ability of a system to watch what's going on and make decisions based on that,\" explained Dr Bowden.\n\nThe research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets.\n\nExperts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos. \"If you get up at three o'clock in the morning, and you go downstairs, there are probably two things you are going to do: either going to the bathroom, or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea,\" said Dr Bowden. \"Now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on.\" You might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday, and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left. This might sound like a scary vision of an Orwellian future. But it might all depend on the face that is watching you. \"When we put the surveillance cameras in our centre, a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them,\" said Dr Bowden. \"But when Jeremiah's camera went in, nobody minded, because although it's still watching them, they could see what it was watching.\"\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the purpose of this passage?\nWhat does Jeremiah do?\nWhat are the benefits of avatars?\nHow do avatars have an impact on society?\nWhat is the next step in Dr. Bowden's research with avatars?"}

But the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words \"Stay tuned\". No one at Lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.\n\nLycos Europe's \"Make love not spam\" campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. People were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their PC was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. Lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. But the plan has proved controversial.\n\nMonitoring firm Netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.\n\nThe downing of the sites could dent Lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. In such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. Laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. Lycos Europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. The site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, \"Stay tuned\". The numerical internet address of the site has also changed. This is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the Lycos screensaver site. The campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. Many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. \"Attacking a spammer's website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick,\" said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for Sophos. \"Not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.\"\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the Lycos campaign?\nWhat are the different positions of other organisations about the campaign?\nWhat are the implications of all this for companies that rely on spam to advertise their services?"}

The company also said it now believed the development area would be able to produce oil for more than 25 years. Cairn's share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds, but its shares were hit in December following a disappointing drilling update. December's share fall means that Cairn is still in danger of being relegated from the FTSE 100 when the index is reshuffled next month. Cairn's shares closed up 64 pence, or 6%, at 1130p on Thursday.\n\nBefore Christmas, Cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in Rajasthan had been disappointing, which caused its shares to lose 18% in one day.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, the group said its belief that the path of oil in the area actually moved further to the west had proved correct. \"This area does need more appraisal drilling but it looks very strong,\" Dr Mike Watts head of exploration said. Chief executive Bill Gammell added: \"The more we progress in Rajasthan the better we feel about it.\" Cairn made the discovery after having been granted an extension to their drilling licence in January by Indian authorities. The firm has applied for a 30-month extension to scout for oil outside its main development area, which includes the Mangala and Aishwariya fields where Cairn has previously announced major discoveries.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nFile-swappers ready new network\n\nLegal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down.\n\nOne site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. A test version of the new Exeem program will be released in late January. But doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are \"quality copies\".\n\nIn late December movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the BitTorrent network. The legal campaign worked because of the way that BitTorrent is organised. That file-sharing system relies on links called \"trackers\" that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. Shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the BitTorrent network. One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to.\n\nNow the man behind suprnova.org, who goes by the nickname Sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed Exeem. In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems. Like BitTorrent, Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. Like Kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. There will be no centrally maintained list. This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. The Exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. An early public version of the software should be available before February. Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software was in development. There were no plans for a Linux or Mac version. He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. Despite Suprnova administrator Sloncek's involvement with Exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called Swarm Systems that is based on Caribbean island Saint Kitts and Nevis.\n\nUsers of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, Sloncek told Novastream.\n\nDr Johan Pouwelse, a researcher at the Delft University of Technology who studies peer-to-peer networks, said Exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. But, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. \"Exeem cannot prevent pollution,\" he said. \"The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,\" he said. Studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine Kazaa by putting in fakes. By contrast moderators on Suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. \"The moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like Kazaa,\" he said. \"There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity,\" he said. Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. When big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said Mr Pouwelse. He added that the legal attacks on BitTorrent had driven people away from sites such as Suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. \"It's hard to compete with free,\" he said. No-one from the Motion Picture Association of America was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the drawbacks of Exeem?\nWhat is Swarm Systems?\nWhat problems might Exeem have that BitTorrent did not have?\nWhich organizations may be working to sabotage the success of Exeem?"}

Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created, through each of the stages of its distribution, to its playback. The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly, when on the move, at home or at work, no matter who supplies the devices, network, content, or content protection scheme. More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica. It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required.\n\nThe European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach. They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses. The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. This is bound to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes. Currently DRM solutions are incompatible, locking certain types of purchased content, making them unplayable on all platforms. With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant DRM scheme is huge. Although entertainment is an obvious first step, it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare, energy efficiency and control of the smart home.

But a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. And yes, that includes Halo 2.

It is also the toughest game you are likely to play, as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on.\n\nPlayers must battle soldiers, snowmen, zombies, giant crabs and aliens, not to mention the huge, screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels.\n\nThe shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. Fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers, instead, to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. Tanks, jets and submarines can be commandeered, as well as cannon-toting camels, elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of Iraq. Doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls, and while this is a tough nut to crack, it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nScreensaver tackles spam websites\n\nNet users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites\n\nInternet portal Lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail. Lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out. The net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool, spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data.\n\n\"We've never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do,\" said Malte Pollmann, spokesman for Lycos Europe. \"In the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users,\" he said, \"but now we are going to go one step further.\"\n\n\"We've found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers.\" By getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver, Lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity. Mr Pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with. He said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web. \"Every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day,\" he said, \"about one MP3 file.\" But, he said, if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day.

The list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as Spamcop. To limit the chance of mistakes being made, Lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods. As these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs, the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive, said Mr Pollmann. Sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests. Early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85%. Users do not have to be registered users of Lycos to download and use the screensaver. While working, the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data. The screensaver is due to be launched across Europe on 1 December and before now has only been trialled in Sweden. Despite the soft launch, Mr Pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days. \"There's a huge user demand to not only filter spam day-by-day but to do something more,\" he said \"Before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive.\"\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Who is publishing this article?\nIs the screensaver being made available to all users, or only those who are Lycos subscribers?\nDo the screensaver requests themselves slow down other internet browsing/content downloading time?\nDoes this screensaver affect other people's computer usage besides spam websites (e.g. slowing their download rates)?"}

Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by handset maker Ericsson. \"Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab. \"We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives,\" he said. \"We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing,\" he told the BBC News website.\n\nFor the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. \"People's habits remain the same,\" said Dr Bjorn. \"They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it.\"\n\nOne good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. Youngsters' use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. Ericsson's research has shown that consumers divide into different \"tribes\" that use phones in different ways. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. \"For instance,\" he said, \"older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago.\" This was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.\n\nAnother factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.\n\nOnce this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off. Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. In 2003 the figure was 29%. Similarly, across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. In 2003 only 4% of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month. Now the figure is 14%. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. \"Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras,\" he said. Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings, holidays and birthdays. By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why did the 14,000 participants in the study use their mobile phones?\nWhat specific reasons led to the popularity of camera phones in Japan and Europe?\nWhat are some of the different \"tribes\" of phone users according to Ericsson?\nWhy is it important for 25% of all consumers to have handsets with new innovations on them before use of these innovations becomes widespread?"}
{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nCyber criminals step up the pace\n\nSo-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004, say security experts.\n\nThe number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. In 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. Other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.\n\nIn its end-of-year report, MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. In September 2003, MessageLabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. But by September 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. Worryingly, said the firm, phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data.\n\nOlder attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. Other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. \"E-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity,\" said Mark Sunner, chief technology officer at MessageLabs. \"In just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online,\" he said. Mr Sunner said MessageLabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. \"Already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed, indicating a shift from the random, scattergun approach, to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses,\" he said. Although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. One of the biggest outbreaks took place in January when the MyDoom virus started circulating. To date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. Also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. In 2003 only 40% of messages were spam.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nHalo 2 heralds traffic explosion\n\nThe growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms, warns network monitoring company Sandvine.\n\nIt issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the Xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of Halo 2. The 9 November traffic explosion has continued into December, said Sandvine. Service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth. As well as being a popular single-player title, Halo 2 can be connected to Microsoft's subscription-based broadband network, Xbox Live. Gamers who want to play online can create their own clan, or team, and take on others to see how well they compare.\n\nBut the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said Sandvine's chief technology officer Marc Morin.\n\nIn a bid to cope and ease congestion, providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent, finding out who is using bandwidth and for what. It could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use. \"The explosion in Xbox Live traffic attributed to Halo 2 should be seen as a clarion call,\" he said. \"ISPs need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games,\" he added.\n\nOne of the main factors that spoils online gaming is \"lag\" in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world. Gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest \"lag\". Analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said Lindsay Schroth, an analyst with research firm The Yankee Group. \"In the competitive broadband environment, operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming,\" she said.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nSet your television to wow\n\nTelevision started off as a magical blurry image. Then came the sharpness, the colour and the widescreen format. Now the TV set is taking another leap forward into a crystal clear future, although those in Europe will have to be patient.\n\nAfter years of buzz about high-definition TV (HDTV) it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world, mainly the US and Japan. If you believe the hype, then HDTV will so wow you, that you will never want to go back to your old telly. \"HDTV is just the latest must-have technology in viewers' homes,\" says Jo Flaherty, a senior broadcaster with the CBS network in the US. All television images are made up of pixels, going across the screen, and scan lines going down. British TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. By contrast, HDTV offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. The result is a picture which can be up to six times as sharp as standard TV. But to get the full impact, programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a HDTV set to receive them. Most new computer displays are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures. Viewers in Japan, the US, Australia, Canada and South Korea are already embracing the new TV technology, with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format, which includes 5.1 digital surround sound.\n\nBut TV viewers in Europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images.\n\nMany high-end European TV programmes, such as the recent Athens Olympics, are already being produced in high-definition. But they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines. The prospects for getting sharper images soon do not seem very encouraging. According to consultants Strategy Analytics, only 12% of homes in Europe will have TVs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by 2008. But the HDTV hype spilling out of the US and Japan has spurred European broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change. Big sports and entertainment events are set to help trigger the general public's attention. The 2006 World Cup in Germany will be broadcast in high-definition.\n\nIn the UK, satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006. There is already a HDTV service in Europe called Euro1080. Other European broadcasters, especially in France and Germany, also aiming to launch similar services.\n\nIn Britain, digital satellite and cable are largely seen as the natural home for HDTV, at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options. The communications watchdog Ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequencies freed up when the UK switches off its analogue TV signal. For now, broadcasters like the BBC are working on their own HDTV plans, although with no launch date in sight. \"The BBC will start broadcasting in HDTV when the time is right, and it would not be just a showcase, but a whole set of programming,\" says Andy Quested, from the BBC's high-definition support group. \"We have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by 2010, which would put us on the leading edge.\" One of the options under consideration is to offer high-definition pictures on the web. The BBC has already dipped its toe into this, including some HDTV content in recent trials of its interactive media player - a video player for PCs. It is planning to offer special releases of selected flagship programmes online in the near future. According to Mr Quested, this could help put Europe back into the running in the race to switch to HDTV. This is backed by recent research which suggests that the number of Europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into TV viewing habits.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What makes the picture sharper in HDTV than in standard TV?\nWhat are the advantages of HDTV over standard TV?\nWhat causes HDTV to be harder to access in Europe than in America?\nAre BBC plans for high-definition television a sign that Europe will catch up with America and Japan?"}
{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nPC photo printers challenge pros\n\nHome printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from High Street developers, tests shows.\n\nA survey carried out by PC Pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab. The tests found that images from top PC printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs. But using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months, warned the magazine.\n\nThe group test of 100 home photo printers for PCs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as High Street names such as Jessops, Boots and Snappy Snaps. The comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images, the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage. It found that although some ink for printers now costs more than \u00a32 per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a High Street store. \"If you really like your photos, then it's definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street, but only if you choose the right printer,\" said Nick Ross, top tester at PC Pro.\n\nMr Ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many High Street developers or even some professional wedding photographers. Some High Street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were 6x4in, said Mr Ross, but the test revealed that images 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home. According to PC Pro, producing a print 8x10in on an Epson R800 printer using top quality paper costs \u00a31.87. At Jessops the same image would cost \u00a32.50 and at Snappy Snaps \u00a39.99. A 10x7in snap at Boots would cost \u00a34.99. \"Considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the High Street and how silver-halide prints can fade in the sun, we're adamant that it's now better, cheaper and more convenient to print at home,\" he said. Ann Simpson, marketing manager at Snappy Snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers. \"Some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one,\" she said. \"Many people are not skilled at getting the colour, contrast and cropping right and they don't want the hassle,\" she added. The magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading. It recommended avoiding so-called third-party inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Can the quality of the image be preserved if it is printed in a different format than the original?\nWhat are the requirements for maximum resistance to smudging or water damage?\nWhat is the cost of a digital photo print 8x10in using an Epson R800 printer with top quality paper?\nIs home printing cheaper than sending images to high street stores like Snappy Snaps, Boots, and Jessops?\nIf we \"really like our photos\" then \"only if you choose the right printer.\""}

The release of the media add-on is an attempt by the Japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market. Nintendo said the media adapter will be available from February in Japan.\n\nThe Nintendo DS is the successor to the hugely successful GameBoy handheld game console and went on sale in Japan on 2 December. The DS has two screens, one of which is touch sensitive, and also has on-board a short-range wireless link that lets people play against each other.\n\nThe launch of the media adapter, and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device, is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the Sony PSP which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start. Sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the PSP. The add-on will also work with the GameBoy Advance SP. Nintendo dominates the handheld gaming console world thanks to successive versions of the GameBoy. More than 28 million GameBoy Advance handhelds have been sold around the world. The dual-screen DS is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004. Nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside Japan.

Critics say the law would favour large companies over small, innovative ones. They say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software.\n\nPolish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software.

So, for instance, US-based Amazon.com holds a patent on 'one-click shopping'. Critics claim the law, which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US, is little more than a law on ideas. \"Patent rights, it is claimed, protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected,\" Eva Lichtenberg, a Austrian Green member of the European Parliament said in a statement. \"Smaller, innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them,\" she added.

It is the second time in two weeks Apple has taken legal action to protect its future products. Tiger is due to be shipped in early 2005. Last week, it filed a lawsuit against \"unnamed individuals\" who leaked details about new products onto the web.\n\nThe latest action was against members of the Apple Developer Connection, a group of programmers which gets to see test versions of upcoming software so they can develop or change their own programs to work with them. \"Members of Apple Developer Connection receive advance copies of Apple software under strict confidentiality agreements, which we take very seriously to protect our intellectual property,\" Apple said in a statement.\n\nIt added that its future financial results were very much dependent on developing and improving its operating systems and other software.

Scottish speech technology firm CEC Systems launched the site in November. But experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments.\n\nThe Edinburgh-based firm CEC has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search. The ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web.\n\nAccording to search engine Ask Jeeves, around 80% of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net. People visiting Speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the BBC and Reuters. \"It is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad,\" said Speegle founder Gordon Renton. \"The system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else. \"We are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people, although the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) is looking at the technology,\" he added. But Julie Howell, digital policy manager at the RNIB, expressed doubts over whether Speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people's experience of the web. \"There are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be,\" she said. \"Blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way,\" she added.\n\nThe site uses a technology dubbed PanaVox, which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech. In the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but CEC says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial-up connections. Visitors to Speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known, if silent, search engine Google. Google has no connection with Speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments, said Mr Renton. \"It is not a rip-off. We are doing something that Google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,\" he said.

Search has become a lucrative and hotly-contested area of expansion for net firms, looking to extend loyalty beyond the web. With hard drives providing bigger storage, users could need more help to locate important files, such as photos.\n\nThe desktop search technology has been licensed from a US-based firm X1 Technologies. It is designed to work alongside Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail programs. Searching e-mail effectively is becoming increasingly important, especially as the amount of spam increases. According to research from message analysts the Radicati Group, up to 45% of businesses' critical information is stored in e-mail and attachments. Yahoo's software can also work separately on the desktop, searching for music, photos and other files. Users can search under a variety of criteria, including file name, size, date and time. It doesn't yet incorporate web searching, although Yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web-based and desktop data. \"We are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content,\" said Julian Smith, an analyst with research firm Jupiter. \"It is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well,\" he said.

EA publishes blockbuster titles such as Fifa and John Madden, as well as video game versions of movies such as Harry Potter and the James Bond films. Its revenues were $3bn (\u00a31.65bn) in 2004, which EA hoped to double by 2009. EA is the biggest games publisher in the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies each. Nine of the 20 biggest-selling games in the UK last year were published by EA.\n\nGerhard Florin, EA's managing director for European publishing, said: \"Doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science.\" He said it would take many years before EA could challenge Disney - which in 2004 reported revenues of $30bn (\u00a316bn) - but it remained a goal for the company. \"We will be able to bring more people into gaming because games will be more emotional.\" Mr Florin predicted that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create real emotion.\n\n\"It's the subtleties, the eyes, the mouth - 5,000 polygons doesn't really sell the emotion.\n\n\"With PS3 and Xbox 2, we can go on the main character with 30,000 to 50,000 polygons,\" he said. \"With that increased firepower, the Finding Nemo video game looks just like the movie, but it will be interactive.\" Mr Florin said that more than 50% of all EA's games were sold to adults and played by adults, but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children. \"Our goal is to bring games to the masses which bring out emotions.\" EA said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry. \"Nobody queues for music anymore.\"\n\n\"You can't ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it,\" he said, referring to demand for titles for such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Halo 2.\n\nJan Bolz, EA's vice president of sales and marketing in Europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. He said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality TV show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game The Sims. \"One idea could be that you're controlling a family, telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom, and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world 'playing the show',\" said Mr Bolz.\n\nHe also said EA was planning an international awards show \"similar to the Oscars and the Grammys\" which would combine video games, music and movies. Mr Bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities. \"People will want to play video games if their heroes like Robbie Williams or Christina Aguilera are in them.\" Mr Florin said the challenge was to keep people playing in their 30s, 40s and 50s. \"There's an indication that a 30 year old comes home from work and still wants to play games. \"If that's true, that's a big challenge for TV broadcasters - because watching TV is the biggest pastime at present.\"\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the significance of EA's goal to become the world's largest entertainment company?\nWhat are EA's best selling games in Britain and why do they think this is relevant?\nWhat challenges might EA face while trying to become the world's largest entertainment company?\nDoes being a successful video game publisher mean being a successful movie producer?\nWhat will an international awards show combining video games, music, and movies entail?"}

The Intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade.\n\n\"We've overcome a fundamental limit,\" said Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel's photonics technology lab. Writing in the journal Nature, Dr Paniccia - and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. Currently, says Dr Paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it.\n\nTelecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved. \"We're trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas,\" said Dr Paniccia. While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. This improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. \"It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light,\" he said. But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. Even better, the laser light produced in this way can, with the help of easy-to-make filters, be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. Semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. The result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. Dr Paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. \"It's a technical validation that it can work,\" he said.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the benefits of using silicon for laser light amplification?\nWhat does the breakthrough consist of?\nWhen will products be seen that utilize this breakthrough?\nWhy has it been so difficult to use silicon for laser light amplification?\nWhat would it take to develop semi-conductor lasers that can process and transmit light in a wide range of frequencies?"}

That was 26% more than in December 2003. The records even surpassed the MDA's own predictions, it said. Every day 78 million messages are sent and there are no signs of a slow down. Before December's bumper text record, the previous highest monthly total was in October 2004, when 2.3 billion were sent. Text messaging is set to smash more records in 2005 too, said the MDA, with forecasts suggesting a total of 30 billion for the year.\n\nEven though mobiles are becoming increasingly sophisticated with much more multimedia applications, texting is still one of the most useful functions of mobiles.

The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\n\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\n\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\n\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nCabs collect mountain of mobiles\n\nGadgets are cheaper, smaller and more common than ever. But that just means we are more likely to lose them.\n\nIn London alone over the past six months more than 63,000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs, according to a survey. That works out at about three phones per cab. Over the same period almost 5,000 laptops and 5,800 PDAs such as Palms and Pocket PCs were left in licensed cabs. Even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets. Jemima Khan reportedly left her iPod, phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be Hugh Grant. As the popularity of portable gadgets has grown, and we trust more of our lives to them, we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers. The numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71% in the last three years.\n\nThis has left Londoners, or those travelling by cab in the capital, as the world's best at losing laptops, according to the research by the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association and Pointsec, a mobile-data backup firm. More than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in London as in any of the nine other cities (Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Chicago and Sydney) where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. By contrast Danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in Germans, Norwegians and Swedes. Top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data - enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details. Given that few people back up the data on their PC it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. You could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else.\n\nEqually, phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends' numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to. This growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as Retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny, shiny expensive one they have just lost. Briton's growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the Mobile Equipment National Database that lets you register the unique ID number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen. According to statistics 50% of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles. Millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as Transport For London regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. For the drivers, finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nMobile music challenges 'iPod age'\n\nNokia and Microsoft have agreed a deal to work on delivery of music to handsets, while Sony Ericsson has unveiled its phone Walkman and Motorola is working on an iTunes phone.\n\nCan mobile phones replace the MP3 player in your pocket? The music download market has been growing steadily since record firms embraced digital distribution. Ease of use, relative low price and increased access to broadband has helped drive the phenomenal growth of MP3 players.\n\nFull-length music downloads on mobile phones have not taken off so quickly - held back by technical challenges as well as issues over music availability. But the mobile music industry is confident that the days of dedicated MP3 players are numbered.\n\nGilles Babinet, chief executive of mobile music firm Musiwave, said: \"Music downloads on mobiles have the potential to be the biggest-ever medium for music.\"\n\nMusiwave provides downloading infrastructure for the mobile phone market and Mr Babinet said the industry was enjoying \"definite momentum.\" But there are hurdles to overcome. Mobile phones offer limited storage for music - certainly nothing to rival Apple's 60GB iPod. But the first mobile phones with hard disk players will be on the market soon and the current generation of mobiles using flash technology can store up to one gigabyte of music - enough for 250 songs. \"We are working in the hard disk area and we will be bringing out exciting devices,\" Jonas Guest, vice president for entertainment at Nokia, told the BBC News website. But will mobiles become mere storage devices? \"One of the problems we could have is that mobiles are used just for storage and playback while PCs are used for downloading,\" said Mr Babinet\n\n\"We don't want people to cast aside their PCs - we want mobile users to hook up into the existing ecosystems,\" explained Mr Guest. \"You must enable people to transfer music from a PC to a handset and vice versa.\"\n\nOne of the key elements of the Nokia and Microsoft deal is the agreed ability to transfer songs between a handset and a PC. Microsoft will adopt open standards allowing music to cross boundaries for the first time. Songs can be downloaded on PC or mobile and transferred between the platforms. \"The line between online and wireless is going to blur,\" predicted Ted Cohen, senior vice president of digital development and distribution at EMI. He said: \"The market is more regional in its maturity. In Asia it is beyond belief. \"The majority of our digital revenues in Asia comes from mobiles. In North America it is fixed line while there is equilibrium in Europe.\"\n\nEMI currently offers its entire 200,000 download catalogue for use by both by PCs and mobile phones. Mr Cohen said: \"It's going to be just as important to connect through 3G or wireless as it is through your PC. \"We want music to be a continuum.\" The seamless experience of mobiles and PC downloads is approaching, he predicted. Mr Babinet said the mobile phone had a number of advantages over PCs which would see it become the focus for music downloading in the future. \"Getting music from your PC onto a device is not an easy experience. You have to switch the PC on, load the operating system, load the program, buy the music, download the music, and then transfer the music. \"All of these steps can be done in one step on a mobile phone.\" He said the mobile phone's billing system would make it easier for teenagers to embrace downloads, because pre-paid cards were already accepted by the age group.\n\n\"Certainly, we have a problem with battery, memory and bandwidth. But it's not about the current status. It's about the potential. \"You will have all of your music on your mobile.\" All three men said that the social interaction of mobile music would drive the market. Mr Cohen said: \"I can send you the song and it is either billed to me or I send it to you and if you listen to it and want to keep, it is billed to you. \"It's a social phenomenon.\" Mr Babinet said: \"Today you use radio and TV to discover music.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nVideo phones act as dating tools\n\nTechnologies, from e-mail, to net chatrooms, instant messaging and mobiles, have proved to be a big pull with those looking for love.\n\nThe lure once was that you could hide behind the technology, but now video phones are in on the act to add vision. Hundreds have submitted a mobile video profile to win a place at the world's first video mobile dating event. The top 100 meet their match on 30 November at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA). The event, organised by the 3G network, 3, could catch on as the trend for unusual dating events, like speed dating, continues. \"It's the beginning of the end of the blind date as we know it,\" said Graeme Oxby, 3's marketing director. The response has been so promising that 3 says it is planning to launch a proper commercial dating service soon. Hundreds of hopefuls submitted their profiles, and special booths were set up in a major London department store for two weeks where expert tips were given on how to visually improve their chances. The 100 most popular contestants voted by the public will gather at the ICA in separate rooms and \"meet\" by phone.\n\nDating services and other more adult match-making services are proving to be a strong stream of revenue worth millions for mobile companies. Whether it does actually provide an interesting match for video phone technologies remains to be seen. Flic Everett, journalist and dating expert for Company magazine and the Daily Express, thinks technology has been liberating for some nervous soul-mate seekers. There are currently about 1.3 million video phones in use in the UK and three times more single people in Britain than there were 30 years ago, With more people buying video mobiles, 3G dating could be the basis for a successful and safe way to meet people.\n\n\"One of the problems with video phones is people don't really know what to video. It is a weird technology. We have not quite worked out what it is for. This gives it a focus and a useful one,\" she told BBC News. \"I would never have thought online dating would take off the way it did,\" she said. \"Lots of people find it easier to be honest writing e-mail or text than face-to-face. Lots people are quite shy and they feel vulnerable.\" \"When you are writing, it comes directly onto the page so they tend to be more honest.\" But the barrier that comes with SMS chat and online match-making is that the person behind the profile may not be who they really are. Scare stories have put people off as a result, according to Ms Everett. Many physical clues, body language, odd twitches, are obviously missing with SMS and online dating services. Still images do not necessarily provide all those necessary cues. \"It could really take off because you do get the whole package. With a static e-mail picture, you don't know who the person is behind it is.\" So checking out a potential date by video phone also gives singletons a different kind of barrier, an extra layer of protection; a case of WLTS before WLTM. \"If you are trapped in real-life blind date context, you can't get away and you feel embarrassed. \"With a video meeting, you really have the barrier of the phone so if you don't like them you don't have to suffer the embarrassment.\"\n\nThere is a more serious side to this new use of technology though. With money being made through more adult-themes content and services which let people meet and chat, the revenue streams for mobile carriers will grow with 3G, thinks Paolo Pescatore mobile industry specialist for analysts IDC. \"Wireless is a medium that is being exploited with a number of features and services. One is chatting and the dating element is key there,\" he said. \"The foundation has been set by SMS and companies are using media like MMS and video to grow the market further.\" But carriers need to be wary and ensure that if they do launch such 3G dating services, they ensure mechanism are in place to monitor and be aware who is registers and accesses these services on regular basis, he cautioned. In July, Vodafone introduced a content control system to protect children from such adult content. The move was as a result of a code of practice agreed by the UK's six largest mobile phone operators in January. The system means Vodafone users need to prove they are over 18 before firewalls are lifted on explicit websites or chat rooms dealing with adult themes. The impetus was the growing number of people with handsets that could access the net, and the growth of 3G technologies.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the benefits of video phones when looking for love?\nWhat has happened to dating because of the internet and mobile phones?\nWhy is \"being honest\" in person important when looking for a partner?\nWho is 3G aimed at?"}

The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May. The BDO optimism index - a leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to 102.5, from 102.2 in October. The rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.\n\nThe only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, BDO said.

This week, we're hearing from Marianne Petersen, who is planning to convert a barn in Sweden into a base for her freelance writing work. Click on the link under her photograph to read her story, and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say. And if you want to take part in the series, go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch.\n\nWorking from home presents a multitude of challenges. Understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style. Do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others? Are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done? Do you build on the ideas of others - or are you a more introspective problem solver?. In order for a virtual office to succeed, keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential. It may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit, and to keep strict office hours. Referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space. It is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours, keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network. Isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out, and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry. Joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like-minded people may assist. It is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy - with the danger that when the workload eases, they have to be resurrected.\n\n\n\nPrior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight, and the structure is checked for stability. It appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing.\n\nIdeally, the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn. This would also allow for a well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured. It is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity. In order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating, power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate. Ideally, it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities. The walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed, and the walls should be painted in a light colour. The owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks; this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface. I would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn. As for lighting, consider a combination of floor mounted uplights, wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights. Use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior.\n\n\n\nPlease click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for Marianne's barn.\n\nThe layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space. Large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available. The finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting, while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace.\n\n\n\nRegarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house, your plan of going wireless is sensible. A wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless LAN card in the PC in the renovated area may be sufficient. However, important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass, which could result in a weak signal strength. You may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area. Your local IT supplier will be able to advise on this. If you haven't already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software, it is essential to do so, to protect your investment. To really take advantage of wireless technology, you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor. Or you could use one of the new Tablet computers, which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built-in hand recognition software. And finally, you will save money and space by considering a multi-function product for print, scan, copy and fax.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the purpose of this office?\nWhat are the challenges associated with remote working environments?\nWhat are considerations for creating a remote office that will be both efficient and comfortable for employees and visitors?\nHow do you think this space would function according to what is outlined in the passage?"}

And its owner, P&O Cruises - now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential PR fiasco. No-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. The warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world's biggest investment banks had upped its target for Carnival's share price, from \u00a335 to \u00a336.20. Other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 GMT Carnival's shares in London were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at \u00a332.26.\n\nWhy the mismatch between the public perception and the market's response? \"The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,\" says Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion. \"It was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise, after all. But the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events.\"\n\nDespite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel in a large Carnival fleet, the UK's P&O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003. And generally speaking, Carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. \"Carnival has an incredibly strong track record,\" Mr Champion.\n\nSimilarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the Aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. That should mitigate some of the PR risk, both for Carnival and its main competitor, Royal Caribbean. \"While not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,\" wrote analysts from Citigroup Smith Barney in a note to clients on Friday. \"Moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises.\" After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK - but for Carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash.\n\nAssuming that Citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in Carnival's favour. In the wake of P&O Princess's takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. Given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, \"slowing supply growth\" is a certainty, said David Anders at Merrill Lynch on Thursday. In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited. And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated Aurora in the future.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the difference between public perception and market response?\nWhat's the impact on markets for this event?\nHow is it possible that Carnival stocks in London have fallen only a single penny or 0.03% (London)?\nHow do analysts not expect the Aurora incident to affect future bookings, pricing, and demand for Carnival cruises?\nWhy will supply of new cruise ships slow down?\nWhat is Merrill Lynch expecting to happen with a supply decrease in new ships with Carnival as market leader?"}
{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nBT offers equal access to rivals\n\nBT has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals.\n\nThe move comes after telecom regulator Ofcom said in November that the firm must offer competitors \"real equality of access to its phone lines\". At the time, Ofcom offered BT the choice of change or splitting into two. Ofcom is carrying out a strategic review aimed at promoting greater competition in the UK telecom sector. BT's competitors have frequently accused it of misusing its status as the former telecoms monopoly and controller of access to many customers to favour its own retail arm.\n\nThis latest submission was delivered to the watchdog ahead of a deadline for the second phase of its review.\n\n\"Central to the proposals are plans by BT to offer operators lower wholesale prices, faster broadband services and transparent, highly-regulated access to BT's local network,\" the former monopoly said in a statement. \"The United Kingdom has the opportunity to create the most exciting and innovative telecoms market in the world,\" BT chief executive Ben Verwaayen said. \"BT has a critical role to play, and today we are making a set of far-reaching proposals towards that framework,\" he said. BT wants lighter regulation in exchange for the changes, as well as the removal of the break-up threat.\n\nThe group is to set up a new Access Services division - with a separate board which would include independent members - to ensure equal access for rivals to the \"local loop\", the copper wires that run between telephone exchanges and households. The company also unveiled plans to cut the wholesale prices of its most popular broadband product by about 8% from April in areas of high customer demand.\n\nIt added that it plans to invest \u00a310bn in the next five years to create a \"21st Century network\". To meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth, BT said it would begin trials in April with a view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn.\n\nTelecom analysts Ovum welcomed the move, saying BT had \"given a lot of ground\".\n\n\"The big question now is whether the industry, and particularly Ofcom feels BT's proposals go far enough ...Now the real negotiation begins,\" director of telecoms research Tony Lavender said. Internet service provider (ISP) Plus.net also backed the proposals saying \"we will be entirely happy if Ofcom accepts them\". \"BT has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field. The scenario now is how well people execute their business plans as a service provider,\" chief executive Lee Strafford said. Chris Panayis, managing director of ISP Freedom2surf said that it would make the situation clearer for business. \"I think it's the first productive thing we've had from BT,\" he said.\n\nAOL backed the price cuts but said regulation was still needed to ensure a level playing field. \"This is a reminder to Ofcom that as long as BT can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will, the process of opening up the UK's local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile,\" a spokesman said. \"Ofcom needs to return to regulation of the wholesale broadband service [IPStream] and provide more robust rules for local loop unbundling if consumers are to see the benefits of increased competition and infrastructure investment.\" More than 100 telecom firms, consumer groups and other interested parties are expected to make submissions to the regulator during this consultation phase.

The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) said regional exports reached $445.1bn (\u00a3227bn;331bn euros) in 2004. Doubts about the strength of the US recovery and overheating of the Chinese economy do however pose risks for 2005. Both organisations also warned that high oil prices raise the risk of either inflation or recession.\n\nNevertheless, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) still forecasts growth of 4% for 2005. Strong recovery in some countries, such as Venezuela and Uruguay, boosted the overall performance of the region. ECLAC also said that the six largest Latin American economies (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) grew by more than 3% for only the second time in 20 years. Chinese and US economic strength helped boost exports, as did strong demand for agricultural and mining products. In fact, Latin American exports to China grew 34%, to $14bn.

In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\n\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (\u00a3398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\n\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending.

In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this.

Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\n\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the main reason behind investor's lack of concern about economic impact?\nHow much might Thailand lose in tourism revenue over the next three months?\nHow long before tourists in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level?\nHow much does a Maldives government spokesman estimate its economic cost of the disaster at?"}

Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes.

Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\n\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA's 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called \"magic circle\", in the hope of propping up one another's share prices.\n\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews.

The Xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The Beijing News said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the Three Gorges Underground Power Plant and the Three Gorges Project Electrical Power Supply Plant.\n\nSo far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by China's State Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order.

At the same time, India's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.\n\nIndia produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. Consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.\n\n\"For countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,\" said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. India is a \"dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil\". By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim. \"We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline,\" Mr Westwood said. \"By 2020, production may only be at half of today's levels.\" ONGC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam, Sudan and Russia. The company is a partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin-1 oil field off Russia's Siberian coast.\n\nONGC is, however, not the only firm interested in Yugansk.\n\nChinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on Thursday, Italy refused to rule out an interest. ONGC's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees. The dispute is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk. On Thursday, a US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February. Should that happen, Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why are they interested in Yukos?\nWhat do they want to do with Yugansk?\nWho else is interested in the assets?\nWhy did Russia take over Yukos and what are the consequences for Yukos shareholders, employees, and stakeholders?\nWhat will be ONGC's strategy if the US court turns down Yukos' bankruptcy petition on 16 February 2006?"}

In addition to the penalty, Monsanto also agreed to three years' close monitoring of its business practices by the American authorities. It said it accepted full responsibility for what it called improper activities.\n\nA former senior manager at Monsanto directed an Indonesian consulting firm to give a $50,000 bribe to a high-level official in Indonesia's environment ministry in 2002. The manager told the company to disguise an invoice for the bribe as \"consulting fees\".\n\nMonsanto was facing stiff opposition from activists and farmers who were campaigning against its plans to introduce genetically-modified cotton in Indonesia. Despite the bribe, the official did not authorise the waiving of the environmental study requirement. Monsanto also has admitted to paying bribes to a number of other high-ranking officials between 1997 and 2002.\n\nThe chemicals-and-crops firm said it became aware of irregularities at a Jakarta-based subsidiary in 2001 and launched an internal investigation before informing the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nChinese exports rise 25% in 2004\n\nExports from China leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth.\n\nThe spurt put China's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. It may also increase pressure on China to relax the peg joining its currency, the yuan, with the weakening dollar. The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. State Administration of Taxation head Xie Xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; \u00a3165bn).\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. With imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. The increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to Mr Xie. China's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with China a sensitive political issue in Washington. The peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses at home. A US report issued on Tuesday on behalf of a Congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003. The pace accelerated in the final three years of the period, said the report for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors.

The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them. Instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option. \"The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable,\" said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper. Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. Indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.\n\nSports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission's road rage. It wants them to use public transport, and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. Mr Wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. Indoor parking may be costly, but it is not always secure. Mr Wang's team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; \u00a326). The Beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries' motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic.

Nearly 9,000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for Business and HIV/AIDS: Commitment and Action?\n\nDr Taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as \"too little, too late\". The issue will be highlighted to business and world leaders at the World Economic Forum, which meets in Davos, Switzerland, next week. The WEF report shows that despite the fact that 14,000 people contract HIV/Aids every day, concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months. Most (71%) have no policies in place to address the disease. Nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of HIV among their staff. The UN programme tackling Aids, UNAIDS, pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with HIV/Aids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible.\n\nOne company that does have a plan is Anglo-American, the international mining company, which estimates an HIV prevalence of 24% among its 130,000-strong Southern African workforce.\n\nOver the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for HIV infection, coupled with anti-retroviral therapy for employees progressing to Aids. Over 90% of the 2,200 employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work. \"Effective action on HIV/Aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations,\" said Brian Brink, senior vice-president, health, at Anglo-American.\n\n\"Companies should encourage all workers to know their HIV status, making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol,\" he said. \"Providing access to treatment is a critical part of this.\" Across sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place, according to the report. The gap is even wider in China, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Russia, the so-called \"next wave\" countries, which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new HIV/Aids cases worldwide by 2010. The report adds \"an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the HIV/Aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting,\" said David Bloom, professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nThe WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV/Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them. A key priority, in both high and low-prevalence settings, said the WEF is to establish a policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why did the study conclude that more than 90% of employees with HIV who were on the company's treatment plan were well and had returned to normal work?\nWhy was there a decline in concern among businesses about the disease in the last 12 months despite 14,000 people contracting it every day?\nWhat is one step that businesses could take to be more aware of their potential risks and vulnerabilities to HIV?"}

One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in London. The judges, who included authors Jenny Colgan and Amanda Craig, were full of praise for her writing. \"What could have been a didactic or preachy prospect turns out to hilarious, moving humane and eye-popping. It's hard to think of anybody not enjoying it,\" wrote the judges.

Fletcher has recently graduated from graduated from the University of East Anglia creative writing course. Waterstone's fiction writer buyer Suzie Doore said: \"It is great to see Susan Fletcher win in the first novel category. As a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the Whitbread. \"Fresh out of university she is certainly one to watch.\"\n\nIn the biography category it was John Guy's The Life of Mary Queen of Scots that was picked as winner. The judges called it \"an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens\".

Her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an $11bn (\u00a35.7bn) accounting fraud. Mr Ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nProsecution lawyers have argued that Mr Ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at WorldCom, ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet Wall Street earnings estimates. But Ms Cooper, who now runs her own consulting business, told a jury in New York on Wednesday that external auditors Arthur Andersen had approved WorldCom's accounting in early 2001 and 2002. She said Andersen had given a \"green light\" to the procedures and practices used by WorldCom. Mr Ebber's lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud, arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.\n\nMs Cooper also said that during shareholder meetings Mr Ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company's finance chief, giving only \"brief\" answers himself. The prosecution's star witness, former WorldCom financial chief Scott Sullivan, has said that Mr Ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to \"hit our books\". However, Ms Cooper said Mr Sullivan had not mentioned \"anything uncomfortable\" about WorldCom's accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting.

She felt, as we did, that it's a very strong case and she was telling the truth.\" She also said that the woman supplied further evidence to prosecutors that she believed strengthened her allegations. Cosby emerged as one of the first black comics to have mainstream success in the US.

GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent Fiat shares down 1.2% on Tuesday, after Monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The US firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (\u00a31.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by Fiat's decision to sell off Fiat's finance arm and halve GM's stake via a capital-raising effort.\n\nThe 2000 deal resulted from a race between GM and DaimlerChrysler to ally with Fiat. The German firm wanted to buy Fiat outright. But Gianni Agnelli, the godfather of the group, wanted to keep control, and preferred GM's offer to buy a 20% stake and give Fiat the right to sell in the future, known as a \"put option\". Since then, however, Fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses, while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut GM's stake in half to 10%.

Not that I ever did that. \"But things have moved on a lot now so it was time for a change.\"\n\nThat change involved ejecting previous host Wes Butters and relocating King and DJ partner Joel Ross from their weekend afternoon Radio 1 slot. The pair have worked together for a decade - meeting on Viking Radio in Hull before moving to Manchester station Key 103 and winning two Sony Radio awards. They also presented gadget series Playboyz and car show Motor Maniacs for cable TV channel Granada Men and Motors, and Pure Soap on BBC Three.\n\nOn the revamped chart show their cheeky, laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions, film and DVD charts plus a look at future single releases, in addition to the singles chart itself. \"The chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme,\" says Ross. \"The show used to be the only way to discover who was in the Top 40. Now you can just click on the internet to find that out, so the show has plenty of extra items too.\" The show's reduced reliance upon the Top 40 also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc, vinyl or cassette.\n\n\"I personally buy downloads rather than CD singles,\" says 27-year-old Ross. \"Even my grandma can download songs now. JK is still struggling with the technology, though.\" \"But it's premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead,\" Ross adds. \"While sales of singles on traditional formats are down, interest in songs has been revived by download sales, which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from April. \"Music fans still want to know what is the most popular song of the week.\"\n\nRoss will be plumping for chart success from rapper Verbalicious and the Stereophonics on Sunday, while King is more of an R&B and dance music fan. \"So listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes,\" says King, 30, who describes outgoing host Butters as \"an extremely professional and competent broadcaster\".\n\n\"The advantage Joel and I have is that we're a double act, with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive,\" King says. \"Wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him.

Apart from this, however, the festival has continued as originally planned. \"When the disaster happened, we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel,\" said the festival's executive director, Craig Prater. \"The decision was made that we would continue, but that the focus would change.\n\n\"Our premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund,\" he continued. \"But we feel like we've turned a page. We've acknowledged our position, and now it's business as usual.\"\n\nMr Prater's sentiments were echoed by Christine Rush, director of the festival's sister event, the Bangkok Film Market. \"We have been careful to be respectful of the Thai nation's recovery from this terrible disaster,\" she said.\n\n\"However, the nation's recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life. \"We are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out,\" she added. Given the conspicuously low audience figures, that support may be more symbolic than significant. However, poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties.\n\nThe eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles, including such Oscar hopefuls as Ray Charles biopic Ray and Mike Leigh's abortion drama Vera Drake. That said, the absence of Thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.\n\nOn a more positive note, the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city. Problems securing air transport, the clash with last Sunday's Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel.\n\nBut the festival has still attracted such Hollywood directors as Oliver Stone and Joel Schumacher, alongside such screen stars as Michael Douglas, Jeremy Irons and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Irons, whose film Being Julia is in competition for the festival's Golden Kinnaree awards, said he had wondered whether he should attend after December's catastrophe. \"I questioned whether I should come when such a tragedy had happened,\" the British actor said. \"I thought it might be in rather bad taste. But then I spoke to the organisers and I was encouraged to let life go on. \"Now I've come here I'm very glad. What impresses me about Thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the West,\" he continued. \"Basically I was invited here by Thailand. If they still want you to come, you should.\"\n\nNow in its third year, Bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. And while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Pusan in South Korea, Mr Prater predicts it will soon become their equal. \"It's grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast,\" he concedes. \"We've had some bumps in the road, but that's only because the festival is still a baby. \"I have no doubt in my mind that in five years, this will be the top Asian film festival in the world.\" The Golden Kinnarees will be awarded on Friday.

Although an Oscar has so far eluded her, her status as one of Hollywood's favourite actresses remains solid. One of the biggest Oscars buzzes in recent years was for Bening's role as troubled Carolyn Burnham in 1999's American Beauty. But her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of Hilary Swank's leading role in Boys Don't Cry. After opening her career in the theatre - and gaining a Tony Award nomination in 1986 - Bening had a low-key spell in television. She then made her film debut as a sex-starved wife in 1988's The Great Outdoors, opposite comics Dan Akroyd and John Candy.\n\nFollowing a cameo in Postcards From The Edge, Bening's breakthrough role came in 1990, playing seductive con artist Myra Langtry in The Grifters - a role that won her an Oscar nomination. Despite some rave reviews, Bening did not win the best supporting actress Academy Award.\n\nHowever the high-profile performance enabled Bening to capture roles in a number of big budget Hollywood productions, co-starring with some of Hollywood's greatest players, including Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford. But it was her role opposite Warren Beatty in 1991 gangster flick Bugsy which had the greatest impact. Bening played Virginia Hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 Oscar nominations.\n\nBugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for Bening - she married Beatty, with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in Europe. The couple now have four children together. A pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered Bening's career in the mid-1990s. She played Michael Douglas' opposite number in romantic comedy The American President, and as a \"fiery\" Queen Elizabeth I in a contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III.\n\nBening was the first choice to play the female lead in American Beauty, director Sam Mendes' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a Bafta award for her strong performance. But current film Being Julia has made Bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the Golden Globes. The witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s London sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by Bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young American - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted Academy Award.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Was Bening born in Texas?\nWhat was the first big award that Bening won?\nWhy did Annette Bening star in American Beauty?\nDid she win the Academy Award for her performance in Being Julia?"}

It's a day I never thought would come.\" The move followed a huge campaign in Ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the IRA bombs which killed seven people. Mr Blair's official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would \"ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister's statement brought to them\".\n\nMost of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. All were arrested because of a family connection to Gerry Conlon. Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe was arrested when travelling to London from Belfast to help his son. He died while serving his sentence. Also arrested were Anne Maguire and members of her family. Mrs Maguire was the relative with whom Giuseppe planned to stay in London, as well as two family friends. She said it was a \"wonderful feeling\" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\n\n\"The people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent,\" she said. They were all jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four, and in June 1991 it overturned the sentences on the Maguire Seven. Mr Conlon's case was highlighted in the Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, starring Daniel Day-Lewis.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "When was the apology delivered?\nWhat does it mean that the families want Prime Minister's Questions to be used for apologies in the House of Commons?\nHow long were the people wrongfully convicted in prison?\nHow many members of each family was arrested for involvement with IRA bombs, and what did they do wrong?\nWho is Gerry Conlon and why was his story made into a movie?"}
{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nConcerns at school diploma plan\n\nFinal appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England's secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.\n\nThe government's response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay. Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday. \"It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,\" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman.\n\nHis main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. \"We must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system,\" he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement. \"It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak.\" The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to \"compromise\". The QCA said the potential \"step-change in participation and attainment\" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. \"Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity,\" said its chairman, Sir Anthony Greener. It is a sign of the QCA's concern that its advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently. But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills. They may be content if it does not \"close too many doors\" in writing - whatever spin is put on it.\n\nThe chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go. \"One of the reasons why I'm so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,\" he said. \"If we don't say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity.\" Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills. In an attempt to address this, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in \"functional\" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs. It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score. Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a \"massive upheaval\". The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the concerns?\nWhat would a \"half-hearted response\" look like?\nIs a four-tier diploma better than GCSEs and A-levels for some people or not?\nHow will the government address the firms' concerns of insufficient skills, as well as the concerns of employers and schools?"}

She said this would counter \"so-called independent\" groups like Migration Watch, which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent. Migration Watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the organisation, says there is no need for an independent body because Office of National Statistics data are accurate. He says he opposes large-scale immigration \"both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture\".\n\nHe said: \"For example, over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration. \"We are already more overcrowded than India and we are four times more overcrowded than France.\" Ms Roche, Labour MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, believes legal migration is something we should welcome. She said her proposals mean \"we wouldn't have so-called independent experts, like Migration Watch, who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view.\" She went on: \"What I would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures, published them, and was independent of government. \"I think that would go a long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate.\"\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What \"independent\" groups does the passage mention?\nWhat is the \"debate\"?\nWhat does Ms. Roche propose?"}
{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nBlunkett sorry over murder plan\n\nDavid Blunkett has apologised to MPs after the Home Office announced \"prematurely\" via press release a review of murder laws.\n\nThe home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as \"a mess\". He said the review would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences. The Home Office has already said the review will begin next year.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and Wales. News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday. But the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. Amid opposition anger, Mr Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday. He said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. Shadow home secretary David Davis welcomed his \"gracious apology\" and the review itself. But he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be \"dragged\" to face MPs.\n\nIn its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. The panel suggested different kinds of murders could be \"graded\" to recognise the seriousness of the offence.\n\nBut the Home Office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. The commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. But it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law. Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was \"indefensible and should cease\".\n\nA key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: \"Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. \"Where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence.\" The commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Who apologised to MPs and why?\nIs the commission review supposed to look at all types of murder in England and Wales or only some?\nWhat is the current opinion among criminal justice professionals on mandatory life sentences for all types of murder?\nWhat does the commission say it will do (or not do) in regard to partial defences to murder?\nWhat are different kind of murders classified as, according to the commission's report?\nDoes this classification have anything to do with the sentence imposed by a court, if found guilty of murder?"}

The rise reflects stronger spending by businesses on capital equipment and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. GDP is a measure of a country's economic health, reflecting the value of the goods and services it produces.\n\nThe new GDP figure, announced by the Commerce Department on Friday, also topped the 3.5% growth rate that economists had forecast ahead of Friday's announcement.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nNuclear strike 'key terror risk'\n\nThe UK and US must realise they cannot prevent all terror attacks and should focus on making sure they are not nuclear strikes, says a top academic.\n\nAmitai Etzioni, a key influence on New Labour thinking, says the US emphasis on an \"Axis of Evil\" is misplaced. The priority should instead be on \"failing states\", including Russia and Pakistan, who cannot properly control their nuclear material, he argues. His report demands a major overhaul of world rules on nuclear technology.\n\nProfessor Etzioni was a senior adviser to President Carter's White House and is the guru behind communitarian ideas which influenced the development of Blairite Third Way politics. In a report for the Foreign Policy Centre think tank, he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations.\n\n\"Attempts to defend against it by hardening domestic targets cannot work, nor can one rely on pre-emption by taking the war to the terrorists before they attack,\" he says. That means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists' access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them. \"We must recognise that we will be unable to stop all attacks and thus ensure terrorists will not be able to strike with weapons of mass destruction,\" Prof Etzioni continues.\n\nHe suggests so-called rogue states such as Iran and North Korea are less of a problem than \"failed and failing states\", which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials. He names Russia as the \"failing state\" of gravest concern as it has an estimated 90% of all fissile material outside America. And he is also worried about Pakistan after one of its top nuclear scientists, Abdul Qadeer Khan, admitted leaking nuclear secrets. Prof Etzioni criticises the US for overlooking those reports, suggesting it was done in return for Pakistani help in hunting Osama Bin Laden. \"This is like letting a serial killer go because he promised to catch some jay-walkers,\" he says.\n\n\n - Upgrading security at nuclear arms stores as a temporary measure \n - Creating a new Global Safety Authority to tackle nuclear terrorism, using the intelligence links established in the wake of 11 September - backed by the United Nations' authority \n - Encouraging, pressuring and using \"all available means\" to persuade countries to switch their highly-enriched uranium for less dangerous less-enriched uranium \n - When possible, taking fissile material away from failing states to safe havens where it can be blended down or converted \n - Compelling \"failing and rogue states\", and eventually all states, to destroy their nuclear bombs.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What does Professor Etzioni mean by a nuclear terrorist attack?\nWhat are some of the main dangers faced by many nations that will result from not taking action against nuclear terrorism?\nHow does the US, and what was or were their role in current international nuclear policy, not adequately take into account other problems that are more important to deal with right now?\nWhat is the significance of Axes of Evil as it pertains to Bin Laden's hunt and the likelihood of future terrorist attacks involving nuclear materials?"}
{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nEU China arms ban 'to be lifted'\n\nThe EU embargo on arms exports to China is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite US objections, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said.\n\nThe 15-year-old ban was imposed in the aftermath of China's crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square. Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained. But he said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.\n\nIn December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. The EU's move was welcomed at the time by Beijing, which described the embargo as a \"product of the Cold War\". German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious on the issue, but on Wednesday Mr Straw said he also wanted it to end. \"I have long understood China's argument, that to lump them in with, say, Burma and Zimbabwe is not appropriate and I don't think it is,\" he told the joint committee on Strategic Export Controls. He said \"it is more likely than not\" that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July. But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country. \"If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now.\"\n\nMr Straw said the US government was suspicious of \"the motives of some other countries within the EU\" in wanting the ban lifted. But he said many of Washington's objections were based on a \"lack of information and understanding\" of how export control guidelines worked in EU countries. And \"intense discussions\" were taking place with US officials to convince them it was the right thing to do. Washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by China to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan. US officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the EU code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses. US Undersecretary of State John Bolton is meeting British officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What does the embargo prohibit?\nWhat has led the EU to consider lifting it now?\nWhy do they think the US government would be suspicious of this?\nHow would this affect Taiwan?\nWhat is Washington's stance on this issue?"}

The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed. Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body's tissue types. Scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney, heart or even brain tissue.\n\nMr Howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. But he argued: \"We mustn't be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future. \"Politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. \"With the life expectancy of the average Briton now around the mid-70s, society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people's lives as they grow older. \"I know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. They are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls. \"I respect those concerns. But I also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Alzheimer's and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems.\"\n\nMr Howard acknowledged there were \"no easy answers\" over such an issue but it was necessary to \"have the courage to do what we know to be morally right\". He added: \"Of course, stem cells are still a recent discovery. More research needs to be done. But we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nI spent 3 yrs writing this horror book, making a soundtrack for it, and making it viewable like a film. I put my heart into something that will go nowhere. I just want to fucking die. I\u2019ve been made unemployed bc of coronavirus. I\u2019m so stressed\nI put an embarrassing amount of time into being a writer. So many hours spent at university studying and practicing. I would honestly stay at the library until it would close at 2 am and then sneak into a classroom to finish studying before classes would begin at 6 am. I won the praises of my professors, taking honors classes, being told I will go far. All for a Creative Writing degree that I can't do anything with. But It's been my dream since I was 11 and read Harry Potter to be a writer. I'm 29 now. That dream turned into a nightmare.\n\n\nI've thought a lot about form and what a book could be. I felt literature has to be updated. Because now we have movies that are a lot more entertaining to watch than just sitting and staring at some lines on paper for hours. So I made a soundtrack for this book I wrote as though it were a film that cannot be made and I made a video for it so you can watch it rather than just read it. \n\n\nAnd now what? Post it to reddit? Hope it will go viral by spamming it? All that will do is get trolls to spit on something I spent so much time and energy on. Go to a publisher? So they can butcher it to make it palatable for large numbers of people? And to get a publishing deal, it would take months. And before I could a publishing deal, I would need to get a literary agent, which also would take months. And then, it would probably be another year before it would hit the shelves. And then, on top of all this, to add insult to injury, I, the writer, would make very little. The profits, if there would be any off of my book would go mostly to the publisher and to the agent. This is because I would just be starting out. I'm not a veteran established writer like Murakami or Rushdie. They can get better deals. Me though? I would have to wait 3 years and see very little in return. \n\n\nI have it all already prepared though and available right now. I just can't reach an audience. I don't know how to. In my mid-20s I had a youtube channel that was growing in popularity. Precisely because I did post on reddit. A lot of people seemed to like what I was doing. But, it grew to be so frustrating having to deal with trolls and comments who hated me only because I was posting something I made. Like it's the worst thing in the world trying to advertise something I put a lot of work into. It's not like I was making hundreds of posts. Any post I would make where I would say: \"I made this\" it would get nothing fucking really negative comments by people who wouldn't even take the time to read what I wrote or listen to the poem I would read - they would hate my post, just because I posted about something I made. I mean they treated it like I was forcing my work down their throats, but am I forcing my work on people by making a post about it? You don't have to click. It's just a post and I would make those kind of posts because hey maybe someone out there who I haven't reached yet might like what I do. Is that really so terrible? I don't understand why people treat it like it's the worst thing in the world and like it's so aggravating and annoying. Companies can have advertisements, but me, a single person, trying to do something on my own, it's not called advertisement, it's called \"spam\" instead. It was so frustrating. I didn't become famous, I'm not saying this, but I did get attention eventually and I did grow in popularity. Precisely because I did post to reddit and stopped saying \"I made this\" to \"I found this.\" Instantly got more recognition. One night while I was drunk I deleted everything I made and my entire online presence, because I was so frustrated by this. 1,700 subscribers on youtube, videos with tens of thousands of views. All gone. I could try posting my things on reddit again, but oh my fucking God there is no way I'm doing that a second time. It was a nightmare to get that far, I'm not making that mistake a second time (except now bc this is a support subreddit and this is all more confessional and I hope people'd be a bit more tolerant and to provide context here's what I wasted 3 fucking years of my life on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLcoexhuMI)\n\nWhat else can I do? Write like Rupi fucking Kaur and shit all over instagram like all these \"instapoets\"? Just write a couple sentences draw some stick figures, I could get fame for that. It'd be very easy. But I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror and be proud of what I accomplished. Suicide I guess is what happens to people who try to have dignity in this world today where everyone besides the wealthy are nothing and worthless. If you don't whore yourself out it seems you will be a failure.\n\n\nI lost my job because of the coronavirus. I can't bring myself to get unemployment. I have never been on government assistance. I feel weird even getting this $1,200 check. I grew up in a libertarian/objectivist household. I can't get something for free, I can only be ok with myself if everything I have I worked for. I always told myself I would die before being in this position. I try to have integrity and pride. This is just humiliating. And it was humiliating working at my previous job.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nI can't stop crying. I can't shut my brain up. I can't function and I can't stand it and I need to make it stop.\nI'm sorry this is so rambly and incoherent, I'm sobbing so fucking hard and I can barely breathe but I tried my best to make it make a little sense and to break it into paragraphs at least.\n\nLast week I got in an argument with someone I was close to and said things to them that really hurt them because I was hurting a lot myself.  It's things that I didn't and never ever would actually think or mean but they just spilled out because I was hurting and terrified and my brain just...broke.  I know that's no excuse, I hurt them and it's awful, that's all there is to it, I feel horrid and I always will.  But yeah, they said and did hurtful things too, it was bad on both ends.  I ended up in the hospital on a 72 hour hold.\n\nAs a sidenote I realized a few hours after the fact I'd forgotten to take my depression/anxiety/etc. meds the day of that fight and I hate myself so damn much.  If I ever forget them (which happens from time to time because I have quite severe ADHD that makes me very forgetful) I get especially sensitive and emotional and more prone to being a big whiny baby and if I'd just remembered to take them I'm 99% sure none of this would have happened but I'm so goddamn stupid and useless that I forgot and now everything's ruined due to my own fucking stupidity.\n\nAnyway.  I came home and things are ruined, people who used to say I'm amazing and wonderful are now saying I'm a bad person.  Everything I thought I knew about myself and others and my relationships and friendships has been completely shattered.  I don't know or understand how people who truly cared about me could change their opinion in a heartbeat.  I don't understand how people who claimed to love and care about me can be so indifferent to the fact I was in the damn hospital having a nervous breakdown over this.  I'm entirely lost and confused and broken, I don't know what ever was real anymore because I just don't understand how someone can go from \"you're amazing\" to \"you're a bad person\" in the span of days.  I have a couple other people still telling me \"no, no, you're wonderful, anyone who knows you knows you're the kindest and most selfless person there is with a heart of gold, fuck anyone who says otherwise\" but I feel like I'm being pulled in all directions.  I know I shouldn't depend on other people so much to base my worth or my opinion of myself but I'm really a weak person with no self esteem so it's really sometimes the only way I can gauge what kind of person I feel like I am.  If that makes any sense at all.\n\nI feel like I've lost so much.  People who meant so much to me.  Memories that I should be looking back on with fondness make me cry and panic and I get so scared and confused because I just don't understand.  Not just memories with the person in question but memories with ANYONE because it's like my whole sense of trust in people is gone.  I don't know what's real anymore.  I don't understand.  I've tried talking and doing everything I can to make it right and people refuse to listen.  I've been hurt so much by people and I always forgive because I understand that who we are when we're upset doesn't always reflect reality and what we actually think or feel, I know that saying things in the heat of the moment doesn't necessarily mean anything.  Being mean and hurtful in the heat of a fight doesn't always come from a place of calculated malice and mean you don't care.\n\nI forgive and forgive and forgive and I've bore so fucking much lasting damage that my brain finally just snapped and broke and then I fuck up and everything is ruined.  It doesn't seem fair.  It doesn't seem right.  And I know that me forgiving someone doesn't mean they have to forgive me in return but I just...I don't understand.  I don't know how someone can go from saying I'm wonderful to saying I'm a bad person in a span of days.  It doesn't make sense and it has completely fucked with everything I thought I knew about everyone and every relationship I have.  I'm so scared and I feel like I can't trust a single person or anything they say anymore.\n\nAll I fucking wanted was friendship and company and I tried so hard and now I don't even know what's real anymore and I'm being told I'm a bad person...I've been crying and crying and crying so fucking hard for days on end, since I got home.  I keep having panic attack after panic attack and freaking out thinking I'm having a heart attack.  I can't handle this, I can't function.  I just want it to stop.  I just want it all to fucking stop.    I'm so fucking tired of feeling alone and worthless and useless and fragile and unlovable and broken.  I can't fucking take it anymore and I just need to make it stop.\n\nI've had fights with people, including very close friends, before and it has never, EVER affected me like this.  I feel like my entire brain and sense of self and everything I thought I knew about every relationship I've ever had has been absolutely shattered and I don't know what to do.  I tried to talk and make it right and I get pushed away.  I just don't know what to do.\n\nI was going to post this under a throwaway because some people know my Reddit account and I'm honestly scared I'm even going to be accused of attention seeking or trying to guilt them or something by posting about it but I can't even be bothered to, I'm so mentally and physically exhausted, my brain feels absolutely broken and I don't have the energy or will to do much of anything.  They already think I'm a bad person, who fucking cares.  I'm terrible.  I'm so sorry.\n\nUpdate a few hours later:  thanks for the kind words everyone, they mean a lot to me but i really really can't do this right now.  i made everything worse and really ruined everything and i'm nothing but a huge joke to people i love and care about.  i'm weak and I'm stupid and i forget things and words come out wrong and I hurt people and I can never ever forgive myself.  I made an utter fool of myself in front of everyone and said horrible horrible things and I accidentally blabbed about something someone's extremely insecure about because I'm so stupid and forgetful and my brain is so foggy I straight up fucking forgot (not that they'd ever believe me regarding that).  I never once judged anyone and I always cared and loved everyone with all my heart, I'm just too much of a goddamn stupid broken mess to go about anything properly.  I hate myself, I hate my brain for betraying me and confusing me and upsetting me and making me act in ways I don't want to or mean to.  I take full responsibility because it's not an excuse but I hate it I HATE IT, I HATE that I hurt people and I really am a bad person and i'm so so sorry.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "In what circumstances did the narrator lose their temper and say hurtful things to someone they were close to?\nHow do other people react to the narrator's outburst and subsequent behavior?\nIs there a chance the relationship can be repaired or is it too late?\nWhat made the person finally snap and how does this affect them mentally/emotionally?\nHow are they coping with their anxiety/depression when they forget to take medication?"}

I can't even say the...word...itself because I am so sickened by how I think sometimes.\n\nBelieve me: you cannot hate me more than I hate myself.

Now this friend is a mild mannered Christian guy, so very different from me, but I love him all the same. I guess I kinda lost it Thursday night and just started drinking. Heavily. And then Friday rolled around and I said \u201cScrew it, it\u2019s a bachelor party\u201d. So I woke up and continued drinking. This kept going till Sunday. By Sunday I was more hungover than I\u2019ve ever been, and more depressed and anxious than I\u2019ve been in a long time.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\n[Serious] Do I have to love my difficult, self-centered and narcissistic father?\nHey guys! Ever since I could remember my father and I have had a pretty strained relationship. Growing up my father had a very hard time expressing his emotions. For most of my childhood he was always at work and was always thinking about money. I vividly remember being really young, maybe six years old, and him showing me his bills and how much he had to pay. He would explain how much he is doing for me and that I should be thankful for his sacrifices. My whole childhood was spent discussing money, bills and my father's stress about making money and paying the bills. **I felt like his therapist instead of his daughter.** He only seemed to talk to me when he WANTED to rather than being there for me because he was my father. He never really took the time to get to know me, however, he didn't have any problems trying to exercise his control over me. He knew how to push my buttons with guilt, always trying to make me feel like his behavior was MY fault. He was very verbally abusive and didn't hesitate to curse or put me down. I spent a lot of my childhood trying to earn his love through awards, a nearly perfect GPA and a full four-year merit scholarship to college. Little did I know chasing after those things would never make him change. My dad is 62 years old now, and he still hasn't changed. Sure he doesn't yell as much anymore, but he's still the same guy. The only reason he's changed is for HIS own health because HE doesn't want to take in stress although he didn't mind making me and my mother stressed for the past 18 years. I'm at a stage in my life where I no longer felt empathy towards him. I don't know if I should love him. **How can I love my father if I don't like his personality? I really need help because these experiences still cut deep and hurt.** \n\nJust to sum up some of my traumatic experiences/memories associated with my father:\n\n1. My dad talking non-stop about his stress and piling his emotional pain onto me . His favorite sentence is \"I'm sick\" (even though he isn't sick) and \"My head hurts\". He doesn't know how to have a conversation that doesn't involve HIM. It is always about him, his life and his problems. \n2. He only talked about money and bills. He always painted money in a negative light, and constantly reminded me of how sad and stressed he was about paying our bills. As a result, he made me feel like a burden on him. \n3. He likes drinking and socializing more than being a father. The only time I've seen my father really happy is when he drinking or with friends. He may stress about money but does not hesitate to buy a big bottle of alcohol for him and his friends. He drinks almost every night and self medicates his pain with alcohol. \n4. He use to be aggressive when I was a child. He would swerve the car if he got mad and his yell was very very very loud. He would basically scream in our faces and threaten to hit us if we challenged him or his authority. \n5. I saw him treat my mother like shit. He never once respected my mother or the work that she does to provide for me and my family. I watched him yell at her and curse at her. The first traumatic memory I have had of my father is him yelling and screaming and cursing at my mother to the point she left our apartment and ran out the door. I was five. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you for taking the time to read about my emotions, it means a lot!\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "How do the narrator's dad and mother feel about her father's behavior?\nIs the narrator conflicted over whether she should love her father?

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nI have no hope that I can survive in society.\nYesterday, my mother admitted to me that if she had the power to have me put down peacefully like a family pet, she would do it.\n\nI turn 26 in a few months.\n\nI am hyper sensitive. I get easily drained by very insignificant actions. Things like going to my therapist take less than 3 hours out of my day but leave me feeling unable to do anything for a day afterwards. I also suffer from very bad allergies. My room has to be kept as a clean room, no clothing or bodies that are not washed or showered are allowed in. When guests visit, I have to be sure I sit in MY spot, or else them sitting with outside clothes in the place I normally sit will cause me to have sneezing, itchy and painful throat, and clogged sinuses which often leads to infections. \n\nWhen I worked a 15 hour a week job, I became so drained both physically and mentally that I could no longer keep my relationship healthy. I lost contact with every nearby friend I had. I ate only boxed meals because I had no energy to make anything healthier. I no longer enjoyed gaming or writing, two hobbies that normally distract from my depression. I would get home from work and make my food and sleep, or watch YouTube until I could sleep.\n\nMy entire life is a burden. A huge financial burden. I am keeping my mother and sister from being able to save for their retirements.\n\nI have to earn money and live on my own eventually, but doing so will only cause me to no longer enjoy anything in my life. But not earning money makes me a burden and puts me into a depression because I'm burdening everyone around me and I am only alive for three reasons.\n\n1- I am terrified of death.\n\n2- The people who care about me don't want me to die.\n\n3- I am greedy and have things I want to see or experience.\n\nI don't have any hope that I will ever be able to live a normal life. I don't think I will ever have a job that doesn't take over my entire existence and cause me to be depressed. But I also know I will continue to be depressed because I'm actively harming the people who care about me.\n\nI want to help people. I want to create things that make others lives worth living. But I know, statistically, I won't ever be able to obtain a living doing anything remotely like that and even if I did, it would drain me into depression regardless.\n\nI wish I believed anything could change. But I stopped believing in that years ago. Every time I leave the house or even Skype call a friend... After its over I just have this instinctual gut feeling of, \"thank the universe that is over. I never want to do that again.\" But I always do. Because everyone says I need to leave the house and have friends. But how many times do I have to slam my face into the brick wall before others will acknowledge the brick wall exists for me and they just can't see it?\n\nBut then there ARE some rare times where I enjoy things. \n\nBut it's like fucking gambling. I've lived for 25 solid years and I can think of all the times I've been happy with my life... And it adds up to maybe 2 to 3 years of it. \n\nWhat if I live another 25 and that number stays consistent? Is 50 years worth living if I can only look back on 5-6 years of that and say I was happy? \n\nI feel like I should quit now while the ratio is slightly more likely to be less dismal. I'm terrified that is only going to get worse. I'm going to live till I'm 100 somehow and the number of years worth living for will still be only 8 or so.\n\nI don't know what to do.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\n24 with no work experience and completely lost in life. What should I do?\n Hello all, I know this probably gets asked a lot but I felt like I really needed to get some advice. Lately I have been experiencing anxiety and panic attacks at night while I think about the future. I graduated from university exactly 2 years ago, and I have been unemployed and lost ever since. In college I was initially a business major with plans to specialize in sports business (sports are by far my biggest passion). After taking and struggling with the required classes such as Accounting, I did not meet the requirements to make it into the business school. With my business degree chances evaporated I changed majors and graduated with a more generic economics/business/sociology type degree with a minor in media studies.\n\nAs graduation approached I still had no answer to the classic question of \u201cso what are you going to do next?\u201d. I still love sports business but that field seems incredibly cutthroat and unstable. As an introverted guy I would really not fit in with that style of super social and outgoing personality to have success in that field. At this point in my life I feel just completely overwhelmed. The thought of a 9-5 job that I don\u2019t enjoy makes me sick to my stomach just imagining it. My resume is barren and the more time that goes by the worse it will be. I have been studying for an IT certification but have made little progress. It makes me incredibly disappointed in myself that I can\u2019t even get myself to study anymore. After 2 years of doing nothing I feel like I have snuffed out any flame of ambition I once had. I dread holidays and get anxious thinking about how I\u2019m going to answer when family and strangers ask me \u201cwhat do you do?\u201d.\n\nI know this is more of a rant but I felt like I needed to get some of this off my chest and see if anyone here has battled through a similar period in their life.\n\nMy main passions are sports, film, animals/environmental justice, poker (I love game theory and statistics).\n\nThank you!\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your advice and wisdom.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nI NEED GUY ADVICE!!!\nI need advice on guys. Recently I went to Canada to go and visit family friends with my mom and my brother. There are three guys and they have always acted like cousins to us. One guy who is 19 has always been close to me I\u2019m 15. During winter break me and him were watching Netflix in a twin bed and he put his arm around me. After he put his arm around me and my mom walked into the room and yelled at us on how this is not lady like on my behalf. She left the room and later I pause the movie because of the awkward tension between us. My mom pulled him aside without me knowing and asked him if he liked me. He said he didn\u2019t know his feelings towards me in that way. The next day at night he asked my brother if he wanted to watch TV. My brother said no because he was tired so when the 19-year-old walked past me I suggested we could watch Netflix. Earlier that day it was his birthday and he got a new phone. So I said I could help him set it up before we watch Netflix. I sat on his bed waiting for him to get changed into comfy clothes in the bathroom. After a while everyone in the house fell sleep and I asked him if we were still going to watch Netflix. He said yes and put on a new movie for us to watch. We watched the hunger games. His arm was uncomfortable so I suggested he put his arm around me. He sat there for a while and I told him I wanted snacks. I told him to come with me because I had to walk all the way downstairs and it was dark. After we got snacks we went upstairs and he sat on the inside of the bed closest to the wall and he got mad because he\u2019s bigger than me. I told him that I should lay on the outside because I was gonna go to bed soon. When he went to lay on the inside of the bed he put his arm on the pillow. So when I would lay down his arm would be behind me. He put his arm around me without asking me. After 10 minutes he slid his arm down my waist and kept it there. I put my head on his chest and we watched the movie for an hour. I got tired and suggested that I should go to bed. He told me that I should stay longer because we were both comfortable. I told him I had to go to bed because I was tired and we were gonna wake up early the next day to hang out with family. When I went back to my room I did not know what just happened. The next night he asked me if I wanted to watch Netflix. At this point I do not know if he likes me or not because I didn\u2019t think anyone would act this way towards someone they don\u2019t like. He had his arm around my waist. We were comfortable with each other. Expected that I was most likely going to go to bed and he wouldn\u2019t argue for me to stay longer. I went to bed at 3 AM and we both had to wake up at 8 AM to go skiing. While we were skiing I fell down and he picked me up. To make sure I wouldn\u2019t fall down again he put his arm around my waist. He asked me if I wanted to do it an all nighter. He later fell asleep because he was tired from skiing all day. I woke him up and asked if he still wanted to watch Netflix and he said yes. He later fell asleep. The next day I told him why didn\u2019t he stay awake so we can watch Netflix because it was my last night there. He said I was supposed to wake him up again and got mad at me. The day we went skiing was my last day in Canada and I was leaving the next day so it was our last chance to cuddle and watch Netflix.

Unfortunately, most women view a majority of men as being absolutely unapproachable. Read on and I\u2019ll tell you the five biggest reasons why!  \n\n\n **1. Not smiling** :  \n\nIf you see a woman scowling, does it make you want to approach her? Probably not, as you already get the idea that she\u2019s in a bad mood. \n\n**2. Avoiding eye contact :**  \n\nEye contact is the universal signal that you\u2019re into someone. So if we\u2019re looking over in your direction but you never lock eyes with us, then it\u2019s much less likely we\u2019ll approach you. \n\n**3. Closed body language:** \n\nThe more closed off your body language, the more unapproachable you seem. It might be crossing your arms or legs. Or keeping your hands in your pockets.\n\n**4. Not having fun:** \n\nThis one is mainly relevant if you\u2019re in a social environment e.g. a bar or a party.\u00a0We\u2019ll naturally gravitate to the men who are clearly having the most fun. Why?\n\n**5. Looking busy:**\n\nWe\u2019re socially conditioned to not want to interrupt people who are busy.\u00a0But most of us these days are doing things to keep from being bored \u2014 which also makes us look unapproachable.  \n\n\nThanks.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the \"simple truth\" about people who are not \"projecting an air of approachability?\"\nWhat are the five biggest reasons why \"most women view a majority of men as being absolutely unapproachable?\"\nWhat are the five main contributing factors that make someone appear unapproachable?"}

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nI'm absolutely gutted, from 100 to 0 in a instant.\nSo, I really haven't been that interested in dating anyone for a very long time, for at least 5 years. Sure I've met people that I liked but never really clicked, or they have other issues which stop me from wanting to be with them. I haven't really been looking... But I haven't been turning people away either.\n\n4 months ago, I met someone who I thought was freaking amazing.  Very pretty, smart, funny, similar personalities, similar interests. She was absolutely stunning. She wasn't perfect, but initially we got on like a house on fire. Honestly It's been so long since I've felt a genuine connection with a female. I'm typically pretty awkward, but things just seemed really natural and easy going between us. We seemed extremely well matched.Issue was, that this was a camping trip and she had come from another part of the country. So we only saw each other for a few days before separating. For the last four months, we have been talking every day, and calling weekly. Things seemed really healthy, and I was becoming optimistic that I had finally found someone.\n\nBut things between us slowed down in the last few weeks. Largely because of me having a rough time with life in general.\n\n* My sister tried to commit suicide, I saved her life after she overdosed.\n* My dad has been extremely low with depression.\n* My friendships have been suffering, due to me finding out about one of my good mates cheating in his relationship.\n* My granddad is very ill, and likely wont leave hospital again.\n* One of my mates died in a car crash.\n* I lost my job (redundancy). And have been struggling financially.\n* I failed study because of the above.\n* I have felt really low, and depressed. Feeling like I don't have much support.\n\nI let her know what was happening, and she didn't seem that worried at all. Although I wasn't reaching out to her as much as normal during this time, she would always respond straight away. She said she understood, and was really caring and supporting of the situation. So I planned a trip to go visit her and my brother, after things settled down. At this point we were not in a relationship, but were still really close. My plan was to see how things went, and perhaps consider asking her out if things went well (I knew for sure she liked me).Keeping in mind, I have family where she lives, and was graduating soon. The job market in her part of the country is ideal for what I'm studying... So moving to be closer to her and my family was defiantly an option. Any relationship with her wont have been long distance for long at all.\n\nI booked flights, and she was really excited. All systems were go.... Until today. She messaged me, saying that she probably couldn't make it to our date, since she had to work instead.... I was really confused, since we had been talking about this for awhile, and she had told me she had taken the time off work.I then saw something on one of her mates snap chat, which to me looked like she was with someone else at a party.So I asked her whether she was seeing someone else. Her response, \"Yea, sort of... We have been staying at each others house, and seeing a lot of each other. But we are not really dating\". She then goes on to say how he is her ex, and they were together for 3 years a couple of years ago, and how they have caught up, and things are starting to pick up again.\n\nI then asked weather I could have done anything differently, and weather things would have worked out if we were in the same city. Her response was that yes, she probably would have dated me if we were in the same city, and that she did like me.\n\nSo well, fuck. There's my weekend plans ruined. At least I have family up there, so my plans now are just to catch up with my brother, and help him work on his project car.Just feels like a really shitty ending, to a really shitty point in my life... So I've got a plane to catch in a couple of days, to go spend some time with my brother. Which is fine.... I was just really looking forward to seeing this girl. It's been so long since I've actually developed feelings for someone, and now I'm crushed.  \n\n\nEdit: Grammar.   \n\n\nHoly shit. Wasn't expecting such a large response everyone.

On mobile.\n\nI've known this guy since we were in middle school, we started talking during high school, and after a failed attempt at my life I dropped out of college moved back home and we ended up dating.\n\nThis guy had been my rock for all those years. He experienced with me the pain of having my dad get a stroke, my only uncle on my dad's side pass away, being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, having my dad's mom pass away, my dad have a second stroke, and finding out my mom had breast cancer and going through chemo.\nThings weren't always perfect.\n\nI nagged a lot on things he did because he tend to me reckless and not have a plan. Overall I just wanted things to be better for him. To be prepared and essentially have a backup plan.\nThis year he started going through a rough phase at work, being in a call center and having upset customers he would take it to heart when they would tell him to kill himself. For a very long time I told him to find someone to talk to, to go look for a counselor. He never did and I saw him get worse and worse.\n\nI tried being the best support I could for him. It was only fair and obviously I did it because I loved him.\nOn the November 7th he finally spoke to a counselor. I asked how it went and he said it went well.\nThen on November 9th he asked to speak to me once I arrived home from being out of town. He arrived at my house after work. He begins explaining to me that when he was talking to his counselor he was asked what made him happy and responded with photography. He mentioned that he never thought of us. Which is fair because it had been rocky.\nHe said he didn't love me anymore.\nHe finished what he said and waited for me to reply. I was in shock. I didn't realize just how bad it was. It was like a curve ball was thrown at me. I didn't know because he never opened up to me even when I asked.\nHe then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. \nIn that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didn't love me? It wasn't logical.\nWe argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me.\nFine.\n\nI let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day.\nWe didn't end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday.\nWe talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant.\n\nBefore I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know.\nFast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together.\nWe went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination.  While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didn't want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me.\nAfter our naps we went out to explore the town. Had a couple drinks went back to our Airbnb and ended up sleeping together.\n\nThe day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. We eventually got ready for the event we were in town for.\nWe ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming. We decided to stay and just wait it out.\n\nDuring this time I noticed he was texting someone a lot. I read the name and realized it wasn't someone I was familiar with. I clicked on me what might be happening, with being on the verge of a panic attack I asked him if he was talking to someone else and he could just as nswr honestly. He told me no, that it was just a girl that was a friend. I wasn't buying it. We went through the concert. Went to the local bars had two drinks and headed back to the Airbnb.\nI didn't want to be the fool so I did what needed to be done where I could get answers. I looked through his phone. Sure enough, he was talking to someone else. I didn't know how to handle the situation but I knew I needed to make aware the other party of my presence. I told them who I was, how long I've known him, and the status we were in. I then added them on Snapchat and sent them pictures of us through the years to proof that I wasn't lying and that I wasn't just anyone.\n\nAs soon as he woke up he saw his phone and knee something was up because she sent him a message. That if he had a girlfriend that he should have told her that way she would have kept it more friendly.\nI ended up messaging her for quite a while and basically becoming more aware of the situation as he had lied to her as well that he hadn't been dating me since August.\n\nHe wouldn't speak to me and he wouldn't care to admit that he was a liar and cheater.\nHe decided he would be taking an Uber to the bus station because he couldn't stand being with me. It didn't work out as plan and he ended up leaving back home with me.\nOnce we got closer I confronted him. I couldn't keep in what I was thinking and wanted to let him know what I felt. It sucked.\nHe said he hadn't loved me for a while.\nThat when he said he wanted to get married that it was just a lie.\nThrough all this I couldn't get him to see that he had lied and cheated.\nWe argued the rest of the way home.\nAt the exit to his apartment I made a comment of how if he cared for the person he was talking to he wouldn't have been a liar. That triggered him. He went into a screaming rage in my face while I was driving on the highway. It was verbal abuse. I feared for my safety in that moment and so I pushed him back. That made him even more enraged and put our lives in danger by grabbing a hold of my steering wheel and attempting to swerve us off the road.\nI ended up dropping him off at his apartment a few minutes after that and asked for my things back.\n\nSince I still had the girl on Snapchat I watched as how he had already rebounded not even after dropping him off.\n\nAnd so now I'm just here. Feeling worthless.\nI cared for him\nI loved him.\nBut I didn't even recognize him anymore and all I ever wanted to do was help him feel better.\nHe didn't even have a regard for me anymore. He didn't even have the guts to tell me straight forward that he was breaking up with me and masked it with the excuse of needing space. And so I've been writing this since 5:23 AM and now it's 6:29 AM. I don't know how to feel. But I feel worthless.\n\n\ndit: during our argument he brought up that I had ruined our trip to Seattle which happened the last of August of this year. I ended up taking 40mg of sativa which he said I would be fine. I then proceeded to trip out because of a bad joke. He started mocking me that obviously I had to fee bad. And I did start feeling bad because I couldn't control my mind and I was going suicidal. I told him that.

There is one employee in particular (I'll call her RD) who is very harsh and has an attitude problem towards me specifically. Turns out, RD interviewed for my position but didn't get it, and I did. The problem now is that she is VERY obviously bitter towards me for it and she is openly that way in front of other employees and even my boss. \n\nThe problem is that when the previous manager was preparing to leave, she taught RD a lot of her responsibilities. Now RD has taken over and won't let me touch anything or really do anything that is part of my responsibilities. When I answer the phone she will talk in my other ear about how to answer a question I've been asked like I have no idea what I'm doing.

He told me that if I feel the need to talk to her, to talk to her. GM told me that he will try to let us figure it out between ourselves, but if it becomes a real issue he will step in. He also made it clear to me that if I ever needed to talk about it or need advice I can ask. \n\nGM also made it clear that RD has had issues with the manager before me, GM himself, and even other office staff. He even told me that I'm \"going to make her mad no matter what. That's just how RD is\".  He also said that he doesn't trust her at all with anything personal and that if she walked out tomorrow, we would be okay because her job is just an unnecessary extension of my own. \n\nRD even admitted to me that she is \"a control freak and has to do things herself\" and that she had a \"tough childhood and that's why she is the way she is\" neither of which are excuses to treat anyone, let alone your boss, the way she treats me. \n\nI had the opportunity to talk with the girl who had my position before me and she made it very clear that my boss wanted ME for the position and that I need to establish my position with RD quickly.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nHow to gain back confidence after being fired twice in a row?\nSo this whole situation started late 2018 when i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, after i was given an offer for a really good opportunity to work at an highly respected company to start Jan 2019.\n\nWhen i started the job i disclosed my mental illness at the time as this company gave the impression that they care about their employees mental health, and that they had a number of mental health ambassadors around so if someone needed to talk they could have a chat with one of them. This obviously appealed to me at the time as i felt as though i could be open... boy was i completed wrong.\n\nThings started to hit the fan only a few days into this job where my manager caught me crying outside the office, and she told me that i was not capable of this position and that they needed someone strong to be in this position and it was a highly pressured role dealing with various reports and having meetings with senior managers and directors. Now her response did take me back, so i plead with her to give me a chance and that i can make this work.\n\nNow to cut a long story short here my manager was micromanaging me as this was her first time being a manager so i figured she didn\u2019t know how to manager due to being inexperienced. So i carried on doing what I\u2019m doing and then she started becoming hostile and shouting at me for things like spelling issues, fonts not right and not cleaning the email mailbox. \nNow to be honest my mental health through this got worst as i was making mistakes but i felt i could not concentrate as my manager was always on my back making me feel more nervous, and at times every task i would do i felt i would have to run it past her just to see if i was doing the work to her standard. But all this came to backfire on me as i was fired at the end of my probation and one of the major feedback points were that i did not take initiative and that i felt everything i do had to be audited\n\nThe second job i started this year in January and from the start i noticed that manager that was trying to train me wasn\u2019t clear in her expectations of what i was supposed to be doing in the role and i found my self having to ask her over and over what i needed to be doing. Once i started getting an hang on what i was supposed to be doing she would say things like \u2018 i didn\u2019t say, if you remember i said\u2019 but the thing is i was documenting everything she said and i even told her this but she claimed she could not recall her saying anything i told her she said. So during my time at this job i noticing more and more that my manager backtracks on everything that she says, its almost like she has amnesia and also she would say small things that would offend me like \u2018I\u2019m not a senior as I\u2019m not doing senior work\u2019 but when i would ask her for specifics she was say \u2018well your a senior you should already know, and its not my job to tell you your job\u2019 so after this i reported her to her manager as at the time i didn\u2019t want to speak to HR yet and her manager advised me that he will go to HR on my behalf and obviously that backfired and i was let go about 3 weeks after that \n\nNow prior to these two jobs i had a really good career and done my job at an excellent level according to previous employers and coworkers. But I\u2019m not gunna lie these last two jobs really took a hit at my confidence and it had make me question my competency in my career. I realised that the problems at these two roles were me and managers jointly. So during the quarantine i have been doing different courses and researching materials online with relation to my role and to also improve my mental health so that i try and gain back the confidence lost, however i cant help these negative thoughts about not succeeding in my next role.

During my time as a grad student I never had any issues with my committee members or any of their edits except for one. One member refused to help most of the time, because he saw it as doing it for me. I get where he was coming from so I just taught myself instead of going to him with any questions.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nWhy does every Virginia governor issue an executive order banning forms of discrimination that are already illegal under both federal and state law?\nEvery governor of Virginia since Linwood Holton has signed an executive order banning the state workforce from engaging in racial, religious, or sex-based discrimination.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832) Recent governors have expanded these executive orders to include further protections, some of which are not currently covered by federal or state law, such as protections on the basis of sexual orientation and on the basis of gender identity.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832)[[2]](\nhttps://augustafreepress.com/lieutenant-governor-northam-casts-tiebreaking-vote-end-employment-discrimination-state-government/)\n\nI'm not familiar with how to read legal documents, but if I'm understanding [this page](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/) correctly, it seems that Virginia may not have had any anti-discrimination laws until the 1980s. Holton took office in 1970, and so considering Virginia's history of racial discrimination, Holton's executive order likely made an impact, even though racial discrimination was already illegal under federal law at the time. \n\nBut as that Virginia.gov page I just linked to clearly shows, in the time since Holton's governorship, Virginia has passed a state law banning racial, religious, and gender-based discrimination. So it's unclear to me why these protections are still included in executive orders. The protection against anti-LGBT discrimination still serves a clear legal purpose. But why does the governor still have to issue an executive order banning, say, racial discrimination, if racial discrimination is illegal under both federal and state law? Is this done solely for symbolic purposes? Or does it have any practical impact? \n\nMaking matter even more confusing, the Virginia legislature has recently attempted, unsuccessfully, to codify these executive orders into state law.[[4]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0)[[5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-house-panel-kills-bills-to-ban-anti-lgbt-discrimination-in-housing-and-jobs/2018/02/08/17051270-0d15-11e8-8b0d-891602206fb7_story.html?utm_term=.cc3b3bd8324d) Most of the news coverage about this has focused on the fact that such legislation, if passed, would ban LGBT discrimination in Virginia. But a few of the news articles that I've seen, such as this one [[6]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0), explicitly state that the proposed legislation would codify all of the protections that have been offered under these executive orders, including those protections that are *already* codified as part of existing  state law. \n\nSo as with the executive orders, I can see why the anti-LGBT discrimination portion of this proposed legislation would serve a purpose. But the parts of this legislation having to do with racial discrimination, religious discrimination, etc. seem to be redundant to existing state law.\n\nIt seems like the legislature could propose a law simply banning LGBT discrimination, rather than proposing a law that would ban, in addition to LGBT discrimination, a bunch of things that have already been banned in Virginia. \n\nI know that this is a really specific, wonky question, and so I'm not sure that anyone will be able to answer it. But does anyone know why -\n\n1. Virginia governors continue to issue executive orders banning things that are already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of issuing executive orders that are solely focused on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? \n\n2. the Virginia legislature has proposed legislation that would ban things already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of proposing legislation that would solely focus on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? \n\nIs there some very subtle thing that I'm not understanding here?

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nIndirect complement or postmodifier in NP In the sentence[1] He is the most talented artist (that) I knowwhat is (that) I know in terms of function \\u2013 an indirect complement, licensed by most, or simply a common postmodifier? Why?Similarly, what is in the world in[2] the most talented artist in the worldand why?Addition to the original post:Having read the answer and the comments that I've received for this question, along with answers to other questions about licensing and the modifier/complement distinction, I have to give this another go: According to the comments below, we are dealing with modifiers rather than (indirect) complements in both the above examples. I'm not doubting the validity of these comments \\u2013 I just still don't understand. This is why:   As far as I've been able to understand, licensing is all about setting up \\\"slots\\\" for specific kinds of structure. For instance, a verb such as give sets up a slot for something being given, and a slot for a recipient; consequently it licenses two object complements (direct and indirect object). Part of the deal is also that the slots set up are specific to a subset of \\\"licensers\\\"; in this case: not all verbs license two objects.Now, to me it seems that this 'setting up slots that are specific to a certain subgroup' is exactly what superlatives do, something that, I think, is supported by John Lawler's answer below:<blockquote>  Most is a superlative marker and takes a superlative construction. One of the things required for the construction is a range for comparison </blockquote>Looking again at [1] and [2], it seems to me that both the relative clause in [1] and the PP in [2] elaborate on the \\\"range-for-comparison-slot\\\" set up by most; hence, they should both be licensed by most, no?Now, if these dependents are indeed licensed, they should be complements \\u2013 shouldn't they? Only, since they aren't licensed by the head noun, but rather by another constituent within the NP, they'd be indirect complements. This is my take on all this \\u2013 could someone please explain to me where I go wrong, and how I should think instead?Thank you\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are the functions of the relative clause in [1] and the PP in [2]?\nWhat is the range for comparison set up by most?\nWhat does it mean that they are indirect complements, rather than direct complements?\nWhy can't we say that these dependents are licensed by the head noun?"}

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nAre particles and waves separate entities? Can this be proven incorrect: Particles and waves are separate entities. Waves are the energy mechanism that transports the particle but not part of the particle itself. If a photon gets created the electron that created it drops to a lower energy level, providing the energy wave around the photon to travel in a certain direction. Does this not explain why a particle acts as a particle and as a wave - as it rides the wave energy to a destination. A surfer rides a wave but behaves like a \\\"particle\\\" and as (part of) a wave - moving up an down and along the wave he is riding. But the surfer is not a body/particle and a wave although he acts like a particle and a wave. Therefor with the double slit experiment the wave travels through both slits, but the particle only through one and is affected by the interference pattern on the other side of the slits. The current \\\"crude\\\" particle detectors destroy the wave energy and therefore there is no interference pattern - this should mean the particle should reach the screen with less energy (if the waves are removed) which should be measurable on the electron it interacts with on the screen, if it has sufficient energy/momentum left to reach the screen.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What is the result if waves are interfered with in a particle and wave?\nWhat is an electron?"}

The probability that we get a specific state corresponds to the coefficient from fourier decomposition of the wavefunction.

Basically I was initially thinking about a mechanical transmitter, essentially just taking two equal opposite charges and fixing them to the opposite ends of a pole. Then you spin the pole around it's center (like a baton twirler) and it will emit some (mostly dipole) radiation.Take an identical setup and fix the centers of the two poles together so we have a cross and spin that in the plane of the cross (picture a tire iron), and we should have a decent quadrapole moment and thus some quadrapole radiation (supposing you could spin it fast enough).This made me consider iterations of this until you've a ring of alternating charges side by side spinning in a circle. Naturally I thought of table salt (some ionic crystal or another). So classically I get that it should radiate, but since it's a bound quantum state I'm not sure? Also, the strongest multipole moment I imagine would be some ridiculously large number for such a setup (probably making the radiation exceedingly weak and hard to detect?).Sorry no pictures or equations, I'm tiredAnyway, for those interested I was initially considering how the moment of inertia of our initial pole would end up being dependent upon rotation speed.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "What are \"equal opposite charges?\"\nWhat is a \"quadrapole moment?\"\nWhat is the strongest multipole moment?\nWhere would the emission of radiation be detectable?"}

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nShort story or novella about an extrasolar planet that develops intelligence, sends comet-like probes towards Earth? Plot Details/SummaryAs best as I can remember, the focus of the story is a planet that is in deep/interstellar space, balanced between the gravitational pulls of two distant star systems.  One of these is Sol, and I do not remember the other (Centauri or Proxima, perhaps?).  The planet's is comprised of a number of frozen chemical compounds that are able to exist in this form because of the planet's unique location.  I believe supercooled helium might be one, but I can't say for sure.  The relevant point here is that the compounds form the \\\"building blocks\\\" for the planet's development of intelligence.The first few paragraphs of the story chart the progress of the planet's development.  Naturally occurring electrical impulses begin a process where, over the course of several millennia, simple chemicals develop into rudimentary circuits, which in turn become more sophisticated circuits, which eventually develops into a complex, planet-wide matrix.  In effect, the planet has become a massive organic supercomputer.Once the planet reaches the supercomputer stage, it develops an imperative to reach out and make contact.  The planet creates icy, comet-like \\\"probes\\\" which it launches into space in the direction of Sol system.  I'm not sure how these are launched. I do recall the story details how the first few probes were destroyed when they were close enough to a system that a change of even a few degrees Kelvin was enough for them to dissipate from the heat.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nArea Under The Receiver Operating - incompatible explanations There is one thing which confuses me about two very common explanations regarding the interpretation of the Area Under The Receiver Operating Characteristic (referred to shortly as AUC). Concretely, these are1) The benchmark of 0.5 for a coin toss, i.e. that if a simple coin toss is determined as a \\\"test\\that in this case the AUC-value would be 0.5.2) That the AUC-value corresponds to the probability of correctly classifying two randomly individuals, one from each group (e.g. a person who has the disease a person who does not have the disease). For the matter of this post, the alternative explanation that, using normalized units, the AUC area under the curve is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one (assuming 'positive' ranks higher than 'negative').What confuses me is the following thought: Suppose I use the coin-toss \\\"test\\\" and apply it two the two individuals from property 2.). This test has a probability of 0.5 for a false negative and 0.5 for a false positive. The probability that I classify a positive and a negative outcome correctly is thus 0.25 (Prob[no false negative for the positive indivudual] * Pr[no false positive for the negative individual]). In all other cases, the two scores/tests will be either equal or have results opposite to what is actually true (interpreting the test inversely as often suggested when the area is &lt;0.5 does not help either for the coin flip case). This seems to be at odds with statement 1).Of course, I could just pick one of the two individuals, test it, and assign it the outcome the test shows - which is correct in 50% of all cases - and assign the other individuals the opposite outcome. This would achieve an accuracy of 0.5 as described in 1) but it would not really be what is described in 2) since I am only testing one person (i.e., one person in the sample would not have a test-score). The two paragraphs of reasoning seem to contradict each other. Is any of them wrong, if yes where or is this really a paradox?*Note that I see that the coin toss would be under the diagonal and would get, together with other tests where the false-positive rate equals the true-positive rate, get an area of 0.5 under curve.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nBidirectional effects? When testing relationships between variables, we are often trying to establish a finding that Variable A causes (or is connected with) an increase in Variable B, or that Variable A causes a decrease in Variable B, or that Variable A doesn't cause neither an increase nor a decrease in Variable B.However, I have a vague idea that effects of one variable on another variable can often be bidirectional. More specifically, I think that sometimes Variable A simultaneously causes both an increase and a decrease in Variable B. For example, how is the openness of the window related to the number of flies in the house? Suppose there are no flies in your house. If your window is open, some flies will fly into your home. After some time, they will fly out, but other flies will fly in. Perhaps the number of the flies will be constant over time because the fly in/fly out rate is stable. However, if we kept our window closed, the number of flies would be zero. This may lead us to believe that the openness of the window causes an increase in the number of flies. However, if the openness of the window is related just to the increase in the number of flies, then no flies would ever fly out of the house, but we know this is not true. My point is that the openness of the window causes an increase in the number of flies that fly in the house, but it also causes an increase in the number of flies that fly out of the house. Or, more simply, openness of the window is related both to the increase and the decrease in the number of flies in the house.I suspect a similar mechanism may be behind some confusing findings in the literature. For example, some studies link cannabis usage to increased cancer risk, while other studies link it to decreased cancer risk. What if cannabis simultaneously increases and decreases cancer risk? What I suspect most researchers would do is look for a moderator variable, so that they can say \\\"Cannabis increases cancer risk in those participants, but it decreases cancer risk in these participants\\\". However, I believe that this \\\"bidirectionality\\\" can arise in a standalone manner, with no moderator variables, like in the window/fly example.What are your thoughts on this topic?

They are universal estimators, over-fitting can be managed with dropout, l2 regularization, l1 regularization, batch-normalization. Training speed is not generally an issue if we have just 50,000 training examples. They are better at test time than, let us say, random forests.So why not - clean the data, impute missing values as you would generally do, center the data, standardize the data, throw it to an ensemble of neural networks with one hidden layer and apply regularization till you see no over-fitting and then train them to the end. No issues with gradient explosion or gradient vanishing since it is just a 2 layered network. If deep layers were needed, that means hierarchical features are to be learned and then other machine learning algorithms are no good as well.

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nHow to Train Your Mimic (or, why would a Mimic be capable of domestication) I'm making a world where I want domesticated Mimics to be a thing.These Mimics are pretty similar to the original concept of D&amp;D Mimics: shapeshifters that imitate objects, and hunt by imitating something desirable to their prey, then attacking when the prey comes close using a sticky secretion and a bludgeoning pseudopod.The questions I have are as follows: Why would a creature with this kind of lifestyle be trainable, let alone domesticatable?How might one go about domesticating and training them?Animals that humans have domesticated tend to have similar characteristics: social, active, and preferably herbivorous (with a few exceptions).  Mimics are none of these.I want them to be roughly similar to dogs in intelligence: not civilized creatures, but smart enough to learn and sociable enough to train for various diverse purposes (the most obvious being as house guards, but can also make good pets, can be used by hunters as decoys, and can even help the disabled using the versatility a tentacled shapeshifter has to offer).  As with dogs, they come in various different breeds that vary in size and disposition.The exact details of their evolutionary progress aren't important (they can be presumed to have evolved from an already existing class of amorphous muscular blobs) but they are a natural creature that evolved in a natural environment, without magic or human involvement (\\\"wild\\\" Mimics usually imitate plants or dead animals to lure their prey).  As such, their intelligence and disposition should make sense for a creature with their lifestyle to have.(Interestingly, D&amp;D does have a precedent for the occasional friendly Mimic and even talking Mimics, though these are rarely used.  But this is more for gameplay reasons and isn't really explained in a plausible manner.)The main goal is to design a creature that, while functionally a traditional shapeshifting Mimic, also has a plausible survival-based reason for having a \\\"domestication-friendly\\\" brain despite its solitary, ambush-predator hunting strategy.Additional details about these Mimics:Mimics are obligate carnivores.  Like snakes and crocodiles, they prefer large single meals over regular small ones, at least in the wild.While they can change their topography, color, and texture, and are capable of \\\"locking\\\" their muscles into place to remain stationary for long periods of time without expending excess energy, they are basically muscular blobs and can't really maintain a convincing shape while in motion (though they are capable of \\\"jiggling\\\" a part of their body to attract prey, and can form basic shapes like tentacles).  They also can't change their mass, though some cleverer ones can change their apparent volume by expanding hollow spaces inside their bodies.They are not good at moving quickly (the fastest they run is about the speed of a brisk human walk, and they don't like to do this often) but they can lash out with a pseudopod extremely fast, and they can climb walls using a combination of shapeshifting and their sticky glue.  House Mimics can be trained not to \\\"slime\\\" but this is difficult.Wild Mimics rarely prey on humans (not enough opportunity for the risk, and not enough overlap between the items humans go for and those that more common prey go for).  Most \\\"chest Mimics\\\" are domesticated Mimics who have been specifically trained to guard a house by imitating an object that a thief is likely to go for.  Some notorious Mimics have been known to target humans though; as with other \\\"man-eating\\\" animals they are usually hunted down and killed.They can see using any part of their body, but their \\\"eyes\\\" must be dark and smooth for them to see effectively.  This makes it difficult for them to disguise themselves perfectly and see at the same time.Mimics are not born knowing how to shapeshift, nor can they imitate an object perfectly on sight: they learn through experience and observation (usually by extending an \\\"eye\\\" on a pseudopod to look at themselves).  The more a Mimic has practiced a particular form, the quicker it is able to take that shape and the more accurate the imitation will be.  Young Mimics can take a few hours taking on a new form; more experienced ones can adopt a shape in seconds.Mimics can pass the mirror test, and learn much faster when they have a mirror available.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why would a creature with this kind of lifestyle be trainable, let alone domesticatable?\nHow might one go about domesticating and training them?\nAnimals that humans have domesticated tend to have similar characteristics: social, active, and preferably herbivorous (with a few exceptions).

{"prompt": "PASSAGE:\nHow can I erase all photos on my iOS 11 device that can't be removed with Image Capture trick? I have over 17,000 photos sync'd from my Mac on to my iPhone running iOS 11. As seems these days, the synced photos do not give you the option of deleting them from the phone (yes, I understand this wouldn't delete them from my Mac). The problem is that I don't want all these photos on there, I only want the last few weeks or so but I think iTunes and the phone are confused as I'm not sure how to get rid of the extraneous photos.To be clear, the photos in question are ones previously sync'd to the phone from iTunes on a Mac that runs the Photos.app; there are no photos in the camera roll. Photos that have been sync'd do not give the option to be deleted, that privilege only exists for those in the current Camera Roll. As well, the Image Capture trick suggested does not work because that method only addresses pictures in the Camera Roll; it does not see the sync'd photos.In the past, I should have been able to simply uncheck the \\\"Sync Photos\\\" box and accept the \\\"Remove from Phone\\\" button, sync and then see the photos disappear from the phone. However, that doesn't do the trick - the photos are still there. I've tried re-enabling and sync'ing with a subset of photos which appears to complete successfully, but then when I try to uncheck and \\\"Remove from Phone\\\" and sync again, they still don't delete.In the past you used to be able to go into the Settings app and under storage for Photos you could press a button to delete all photos from the phone; it doesn't appear to exist as an option anymore, only \\\"put everything on the cloud\\\" which is something I do NOT want to do. It just seems that iTunes sync doesn't try to remove the old photos like it doesn't understand that they're there.Is there any way to delete all the photos on my phone or do I have to completely wipe my phone and start all over again? Strangely, the last backup iTunes took of my phone was nearly 3 months ago and the button to manually do one is grayed out thus I'm a little hesitant to do the restore.\nEND PASSAGE\nQUESTIONS:", "completion": "Why was the Image Capture trick not working?\nHow would deleting the photos from the phone solve the problem of too many photos on the device?\nIs there a way to delete all photos from the device without wiping it and starting over?\nWhy did iTunes stop automatically removing old photos and syncing new ones?"}

I have turned off secure boot and fast boot, partitioned my hard drive (I gave 100GB to Ubuntu) and created a USB Drive that was formatted to have the Ubuntu boot on it (I don\\u2019t have a DVD drive on my computer, so I have to use USB).  I used Rufus 3.1 to accomplish this.  I also changed my boot order to boot first to the USB HDD.When I boot up with the USB drive inserted, it boots to the GRUB Menu.  I have tried both \\\"Try Ubuntu\\\" and \\\"Install Ubuntu\\\".  Both bring me to an Ubuntu loading screen, and then to one that says \\u201cPlease remove the installation medium, then press ENTER\\u201d.  If I do not do anything, it will just stay there.  If remove the USB drive and press enter, it shuts down the computer.  If I DON\\u2019T remove the USB drive and just press enter, the same occurs.After the shutdown, I have tried to restart.  Restart without the USB drive loads Windows 10.  Restart with the USB drive brings me back to the GRUB startup screen.I have tried multiple USB ports and USB drives, so that is not the issue.  The computer is a 2018 model laptop with intel i7, 16GB RAM, and a SSD - power or RAM shouldn\\u2019t be a problem.
