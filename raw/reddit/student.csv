A running list of university closures and actions in response to COVID-19. How is your work changing?,"We're up to two dozen US universities and college campuses that have either suspended classes or relocated a bulk of in-person classes to online/distance learning. Some locations have cancelled classes for a few days or a week; others have done so indefinitely or until the end of the current semester or quarter. I'll keep a running list here if there's any interest.

It appears in most cases, classes are cancelled or altered, but offices are remaining open. Student events are being cancelled, air travel and international travel cancelled or advised against, but staff are still working. Can any SA professionals share how their university's actions are changing their day-to-day job?

As per CDC guidelines [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/student-foreign-travel.html) and [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-ihe-response.html), most institutions have imposed restrictions and guidelines on international travel that includes canceling or postponing some or all international travel. Many universities are also employing restrictions on university-sponsored domestic air travel. Many institutions are also recommending students, staff, faculty, and others to follow guidelines from the CDC and stay home when sick, wash and sanitize hands properly, self-quarantine following exposure to known infected individuals or onset of respiratory symptoms. For the sake of simplicity, the list below is only inclusive of institution closures and alterations of academic coursework.

Thank you to users like u/suzannem18 for providing information on additional institutions to add."
"In addition to starting my first Student Affairs job this year, I have been accepted to an Ed.M program in College Student Affairs!","I just wanted to thank this subreddit for all the help when it came to applying to graduate school and so many looking at my essay! Following my application, I was invited for interviews at Rutgers University's Graduate School of Education in late February! Admission is contingent on obtaining and accepting an internship, and after a scary interview days I am blessed to have been offered a position! I can't wait to start this Fall and learn more about how I fit into higher education! As someone future-oriented, I hope to learn so much and eventually obtain my PhD and become a Dean/Director of a program!"
Advice on taking a supervising position overseeing two men who clearly have an issue with my age and gender,"I’m currently in an office of 4 with one vacant position: three advisors (including me) and one manager (the vacant spot is a fourth advisor).

Two of the advisors are older men while I and my supervisor are younger women. Both men struggled with my supervisor in different ways. Both men also clearly do not respect me and my ideas in their own way.

My supervisor had given her two weeks and I have been offered to take her position. This would be my first supervisory role AND I would now be supervising the two men.

One of the men is very unprofessional in every meeting and sends unnecessary unprofessional and passive aggressive emails to our supervisor and copies our whole team. My supervisor had me provide a statement for HR to put in his file. Another department submitted another statement addressing his lack of professionalism. This guy also does the minimum. 

The other man told me from day one to get out. He has been applying to every position he can. He’s been in the same position for 10+ years. He treats me like a child and dismisses my thoughts and ideas. He always complains to me about our current supervisor and does not follow procedures when it effects other students, even after addressed three separate times in different ways. This guy also does the minimum.

I intend to meet with my supervisor and talk to her about my concerns before deciding on the position.

Pros to accepting the position: a slight pay raise and supervisory experience

Cons: adding an hour to my commute there and back again (currently 45-60 mins) which means more gas, seeing the first man everyday since my office would’ve next to his (currently my office is not on main campus), not work directly with students as often (which I know comes with moving up in student affairs).

Any thoughts on taking or not taking?
Anyone who’s dealt with experienced such as this?
Any webinars or books to look into for new supervisors or dealing with people such as this?

I’m looking for any and all opinions/advice/stories I can get as I have to make my decision at the beginning of the next week. 


NOTE: I was told the two guys will NOT be offered the position because they don’t trust them in the position and don’t think it fits. They said they MIGHT offer it to someone else on campus if I say no, otherwise they have to open for applications.


UPDATE 1.6.20: I got a call this morning saying they’ve changed the position slightly. They’re removing the supervisory aspect and would only give me 2k more a year for the position (which would probably just cover the additional gas for the heat). The two incentives to take the position have been removed so I will NOT be taking the offer and will be focusing on helping my students and finding another job (still). Here’s to hoping my interview goes well at the institution closer to home in two weeks!"
Is anyone else feeling burned out as a result of working from home?,"Since March, our institution has been functioning remotely. I advise students and while they have never been a problem, doing this remotely allows the parents to be within earshot. Every week I deal with a new angry parent who is frustrated for xyz reasons (depts are not answering their phones, the wait times are ridiculous, certain processes not being fulfilled in their usual time frame, etc). The parents (usually the mothers) take it out on me because I’m the person who has a scheduled appointment with their son/daughter.  By the time they get to me, they are upset and trashing the entire institution and I just have to sit there and let them vent. I’m supposed to be dealing with the students directly but these parents (who are seemingly also at home) always monopolize the conversation. I’m getting so frustrated and tired. I’ve been very happy at the job, but lately I think about looking for something else. Has anyone else felt this low?"
Recently Hired Advisor Here,"I was recently hired at an R2 institution as an advisor. It was a batch hiring, so I thought I would share with folks looking into advising what the job requirements were, and  the actual profile of the hired candidates.

**Job posting**

*Requirements*\-

Bachelor's degree, 2 years working with college aged students, knowledge of advising best practices.

*Preferred qualifications-*

Master's degree, advising experience, working knowledge of institution.

&#x200B;

**Profile of folks actually hired-**

All had Master's degrees. All master degrees were closely aligned to education. All had at least 2 years experience working at a university, and the majority were internal hires. All external hires had at least 2 years experience working advising students. The majority of the external hires were alumni of the institution."
I got a job as an Academic Advisor at a CC! But need advice!,"Hello!

A little background about me: Graduated with a BS Public Health last year May but have been wanting to work in student affairs prior to graduation after having an epiphany! I spent the entire year of 2019 applying to student affairs jobs, and luckily started 2020 with an Academic Advisor position for a nearby Community College! I am SO excited to begin my path! I also applied to an Ed.M in Student Affairs program and i'm awaiting a decision this month!!

But aside from that, does anyone have advice about being an Academic Advisor, specifically working with adults returning to school, minority students, etc.?

Thanks so much!!!!!"
The Importance of Academic Advising,"I am an academic advisor at a community college. I have been tasked with creating an online resource to train staff and faculty advisors.  As many of us know, in depth advising can have a positive impact on retention.  

I wanted to ask other student affairs specialists and advisors what you believe is the importance of academic advising?

What role does advising play in student's success?  

Do the advisors at your institution have case loads? 

I have a good amount of information compiled already, but would love to hear the opinion of others. 

Thanks!"
You're welcome [RANT],"Happy awards season everyone. Fuck this time of year.

So here's a shout out to everyone who busts their ass day after day without so much as a thank you. High five to everyone who gives, gives,  gives and rarely takes.

And the biggest ""YOU'RE FUCKING WELCOME"" to the lazy bastards who give just enough effort to not get fired, from those of us who carry the weight and give a shit about what we do."

Job Search Expereince in COVID-19,"Hey all,

 I just graduated with my M.Ed. in College Student Personnel Administration and have been job searching primarily in student success and academic advising. I know with the COVID-19, not as many jobs have shown up and have been pretty competitive. As such, I need to anticipate a long wait in this search process. I was wondering if there are folx that are willing to share their expereinces with the job search with me, and folx who are willing to share with me other areas of student affairs they went into, because I want to be prepared to go into other areas I may not be as interested in. Thanks!"
Why does it seem like no schools publish how much GAs make?,"I’ve been admitted (thankfully) to two programs and in looking at GA spots, they finally made the list of opportunities public. There was no indication though of how much they made. These schools are well-known but it does me no good to know that I can get a GA but not afford school. 

The closest I have gotten is a generic paragraph that says “some GA spots can make 50%-100% of tuition and a stipend” but being in a major east coast city (both schools are in this environment) that can be everything. 

Does anyone know of a website where people discuss these or have everything organized to an extent?"
SUBMITTED NASPA APP,"It’s been 5 months in the making on top of school and work, I finally submitted my application for the grad summer intern with NASPA.

Applying for SA jobs during COVID-19,"So I found a student engagement & housing position the other day and applied for it. It's at a small private institution. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, would you all say that institutions are looking to fill vacant positions or hold off on it? 

I should also add that the job posting didnt have a published date or anything.  After I submitted my application this week I saw it posted on a job board (not higheredjobs.com) and it says the position was posted March 3rd. I'm hoping they're still accepting applicants"
Stuck in job and wanting to job search,"I’ve been wanting to get an entry level job in a university to get some experience for graduate school in student affairs. Now, however, I fear that I’ll have to be stuck in my job that I have now for longer with the covid-19 outbreak. I’m curious as to if anyone thinks that it’d be possible in the somewhat near future to take a leap and go job searching in the field. I’d also like to network in the meantime but am having troubles with that as well. Any suggestions or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
Thoughts on getting a Ph.D.?,"I'll be graduating in less than a month with my Master's Degree but really want to continue to pursue my education and have found some programs that really interest me. I'd be interested in applying this year to join the cohort for 2021. 

However, my goal is to be a career or academic counselor and I'm worried that heading into a Ph.D. so soon might make me over-educated and under-experienced and hurt my chances of finding work.

What are your thoughts on this?"
What's going to happen to education students/student teachers?,"So I'm starting a GA position at my university's education department in May (supposed to be, who knows now) working with students who are going into their student teaching practicums/internships to become state certified teachers. 

Now that all universities in my state are remote/online learning and all k-12 schools closed for at least the next 4 weeks (some have opted for more) - What do you think will happen to students that have had their student teaching completely halted? Do you think they'll have to start all over next semester, finish the k-12 school year with whatever time is left over, or something else?

I know this will vary state to state, but I'm wondering if any universities have come up with their own solutions yet.

Hope you're all hanging in there and staying safe!"
Anyone worried about SA layoffs?,"If there are no students on campus next fall what happens to services like residence life, counseling, study abroad? Can most universities afford to keep staff on if there’s no revenue from ancillary services?"
Supporting students who are brand new to online learning,"With most colleges and universities shifting modalities from face-to-face, to fully online, I am wondering if anyone has seen any great articles or crowdsourced documents that are ""student guides"" for shifting to fully online?  Any tips for students who would be brand new to online classes?"
Student Employees,"My students, rightfully so, are freaking out about school closures because they’re not getting paid. Does anyone’s school have a plan for making sure our student workers are able to afford what they need now that they can’t work? Is teleworking an option at your institution for your students?"
Let me hear some Student Affairs career success stories.,"Hi everyone, I’m currently in the midst of a job search in Student Affairs and after receiving multiple rejections, am feeling very discouraged and disheartened.

College Admission Bribery Scandal,"Shock, outrage, scandal!  Honestly, who is surprised?  Rich people paying to get their children into elite colleges.

We all know that there are lists at schools of students you don't mess with, the untouchables, the students that get the best rooms, the administrative doors open for them, and they get what they want.  Money makes the world go round.

Can't get an Academic Advising position with a Masters?,I have a friend who has completed both her Bachelor's and Master's in higher education.

Hall Director with questions of layoffs,"Hello all.

I hope I'm not adding to the fear and anxiety already present everywhere. I just want to be prepared for whatever happens next.

As the title states I am a Hall Director. I recently (as in the last 6 months) started my job but now with residents leaving and things like summer courses going online  and summer conferences canceling I am wondering if there would be layoffs. I have never been fired or experience a layoff so I don't know what to expect. I am hoping a four-year university is able to keep me but I dont know what I'm looking at.

Is it likely that they will layoff the newest person first? Would I get enough warning? I do not have the ability to move back home without being a big burden on my family, went bankrupt, and spent 4 months of near  homelessness before finding this job. I barely started saving up money again so I d ok nt have that cushion yet. I know I can get through this but I don't know how this works and how it would work in a university.

Any help or pointers would be appreciated."
Moving on from student affairs.. how? Looking for advice.,"Hi! I’m a first year professional who was a non traditional student. I loved what my mentors did for me which is why I went into the field. In my current position, I feel stuck for many different reasons mainly being fit into the office culture. I’m a young mom of a toddler who works with women around my age but just act like mean girls. I just feel depressed every other week and want to find a new job. 

I work crazy hours - last month I had accumulated ~40 overtime that I can “use” as comp time (only when it is convenient for them). My leadership changed a month or two after I had started, the entire office dynamic had changed. I felt no support for the programs I have been running. It’s exhausting and emotionally taxing.

I had moved my entire family to a different state for this job and I have really not enjoyed my time in this position. Im searching for a new position but it seems like everything is out of my expertise. 

So I’m looking for advice, what can I do outside of higher ed with a masters degree in higher education? If you left higher ed, where did you go? Anyone have positive success stories?"
They Checked My References.,"Hi y’all!

Last week I had a campus interview that I think went incredibly well. Several days ago I received some info confirming that they were checking my references. However, now I am at the point of the waiting game. 

I know nothing is definitive until I have the contract in hand, ready to sign. However, I was wondering do y’all contact multiple candidate references in your searches, or your top candidate? What are some other factors that could be at play here that would result in a waiting period after reference screenings?

I’m attempting to ease my anxiety/excitement, so I thought hearing from colleagues would help. Thank you in advance!"
Clemson M.Ed. in Student Affairs,"Hi all, 

I was hired in November at Clemson University in an advising job that I really like. After a year of work, I have the opportunity to take 6 credits/semester for free, so I am considering an M.Ed. in Student Affairs here. A couple questions: 

* Does it seem like a good idea to get an M.Ed. at all if I already have a first job in Student Affairs? 
* Does anyone have any thoughts about the Clemson M.Ed? 
* Does it generally have a good reputation in the field? What if I am looking to take a job outside of the Southeast? 

Thanks for your time and help!"
Moving from Teaching to Student Affairs/ Academic Advising???,"Hi everyone! New to this sub & I really liked the advice y'all were giving, so I thought I would seek some of my own! 

I currently teach high school history and have since I graduated undergrad in 2017. Right now I'm 5 classes away from being finished with a masters in middle grades education, which I began when I thought I still wanted to teach. After doing some soul searching (and continuously being yelled at by teenagers) I decided that the classroom is not where I want to spend all my time. I'd really like to move into an academic advising position or something similar. I want to stay in education, but not as a teacher.

How easy/ possible do you think this would be? A lot of the skills that are posted on job listings match what I do as a teacher, except I do them with students before they hit university age. I've applied to a few places but either haven't heard back or have been rejected. Any helpful hints? Thank you!!"
Leaving Student Affairs... advice?,"I'm a fairly young professional. I have about five years of experience in student affairs and higher ed admin, and I want to leave. I have my undergrad degree in psychology and a minor in communications. I have a M.Ed in Higher Ed Administration. 

I try to stay positive here, but my time in higher education has been pretty miserable. I never secured roles in the departments I wanted, I've gone to a number of professional development events and conferences, I utilized my University's career development program, and it gets me nowhere. I've asked colleagues for advice and it usually isn't helpful. Either they contradict each other or they give empty advice like "" this role is only temporary"" or ""it will happen."" Meanwhile, I'm stuck at a job where 75% of my work shouldn't even require a Bachelor's degree. I'm worn out from the constant e-mail and phone interruptions. So, I've decided I'm done. It's not that I've given up hope in finding a better job in higher ed, it's that I no longer find it appealing.

In this process, I've come to realize that the things that appealed to me in higher education are present in other fields. Things like training and development, project assessment, and out of classroom learning. I have also found that the interactions I do have with students are far less meaningful than expected and I work well independently or with less interaction with people. I'd love to find a role in either digital marketing or a training-related role. I'm hopeful these role will appeal to me more and give me more job satisfaction.

For anyone in student affairs, do you have advice for making this type of transition? Or do you have a colleague who made a similar transition? I'd love to know what they found successful and helped things move along. I keep applying for jobs and putting myself out there and I get nothing. It's hard to reach the realization that my master's degree didn't lead to career development and it seems my past couple of roles have given me few marketable skills. But, it's time to move past that and work toward the next goal. Any advice is appreciated."

Currently I work in a university as a publicist and webmaster for a department. I've realized I really like the higher ed environment but I'm not exactly sure where I ultimately want to fit in, so my mind is on the master's program in higher ed my university offers.

Anyway, I really like the idea of academic advising, but I'm worried about not being personable or relate-able enough, if that makes sense. I'm an INTJ and I take a daily medication for anxiety/depression, but I have been happy and stable for years. I'm totally fine interacting with people and I consider myself easygoing and friendly, but part of me feels like an academic advisor needs to be a sort of counselor that can relate to students, empathize with them, etc., whereas I tend to be more...reserved and analytical?

This is sort of a ramble, but what are your thoughts on working in student affairs as an introvert with mild anxiety (but not debilitating)."
Word of advice to student leaders considering a career in SA,"Just because you enjoy being a student leader and working with fellow students younger than you (in the capacity of peer mentor, resident assistant, orientation aide, etc.) doesn't mean you'll actually enjoy Student Affairs as a career unfortunately. It's much different and with changes in the field the past half decade or so (I won't elaborate too much on my criticism here to avoid backlash), it's not something I'd recommend for a great deal of people. Just my thoughts!"

Cheap/Free Online Licenses/Certifications?,"Hi everyone! 

I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during these hard times. I am currently employed full-time as an academic advisor at a large university and am also currently pursuing an M. Ed in Counseling at the same university. I have been working from home for the past 2 months and although things have been busy, I still find myself with a decent amount of leisure time at night. 

With that being said, I was wondering if anyone on this sub was aware of any online certificate/licenses/courses that I could take on my free time just to gain more knowledge/skills within the scope of higher education. For example, there is a Mental Health First Aid class that I'm interested in taking. I'm not looking for anything in particular, just anything I can do it my free time. Preferably I would want something that I could put on my LinkedIn as proof since I expect to be on the job hunt sometime later this year. 

Thanks for reading! I appreciate any advice I can get."

How to Organize Coursework in a SA Degree,"Hi folks! I just recently enrolled in my first semester of graduate school courses and I’m ecstatic. These don’t start until August obviously, but I wanted to get a head start as to how to organize myself for graduate level coursework.

To be honest, it took me a few years in undergrad to get a system down that worked for me. I realized (a little bit later than I would have hoped) that writing everything down is the best way for me to go about studying.

How do y’all take notes for these courses in lecture and for readings? What suggestions do you have organization wise that will help me do my best? What was the biggest difference from undergrad to grad school?

I want to earn a PhD in the field, so getting a 4.0 to secure funding is very high on my list. I’m really embarrassed about my undergrad GPA and would love to redeem myself during grad school. Thank you!"
Breaking into an Academic Advising Career,"Hi all, 

A little background about me.  I have a B.S. degree in Biological and Conservation and Environmental Sciences.  The past three years after college I have either spent unemployed, working for academic research centers, or working for municipalities doing environmental work.  After doing some reflecting, Im realizing that the science fields are too strict and impersonal for my taste.  I am considering doing a teaching residency, but I am not sure how I feel about working with children.  I would love to stay in Academia though, so Ive also been considering Academic Advising.  

I was hoping to get some insight on Academic Advising.  What are the main functions of the position? Does it require a Masters Degree, and if so, why?  I have read that people have a better chance of working their way into an Academic Advising role by starting off as an admin assistant at a college and just getting to know people.  Ive also read that Academic Advising is flooded with people with PhDs that didnt make it in their respective field and effectively block anyone else from entering the field.  

Through my past jobs I got some exposure to interacting with clients (supervisor event production job in college) and some PR work (showing investors, future students, and visiting professors around our research facility), so I feel that I could effectively communicate with students about colleges and the paths they can take, especially if its in the sciences."
I created a survey but got zero credit/recognition...,"I’m in a position where there’s practically zero opportunities to grow in my office. I graduated last year and so I’m the freshest face in our office of 5. When I was hired I was told because I have an outside perspective that want me to help improve the program, review and provide improvements for policies and procedures.

One huge recommendation was an annual or bi-annual survey. So they had me take the lead on it. So I created two surveys and told them we can edit whatever, add/delete, change anything. I also asked for feedback. This was also 2 months ago. I followed up with my boss about two weeks later and they said they’ll review it and get back to me.

5 minutes ago I received an email from my boss to the 4 of us. She had sent out my survey, made it live, collecting data, and didn’t say a word to me, not even as a “thanks, this is awesome, we’re gonna go ahead and make it live and send it out.”

I feel bad for feeling upset, but at the same time I spent a lot of time putting it together a long survey and didn’t receive ANY communication that it was going live nor feedback on it."
"A.M.A. Leah Wescott, Editor of the Cronk of Higher Education","HELLO REDDIT!!!

This summer CronkNews.com, higher education’s satirical news blog, celebrates its fifth birthday. If you’re not familiar with The Cronk, we aim to spur conversations and provide a voice for educators who may not have the safety to talk about the problems they encounter in the ivory tower. I’ve been in the higher ed game for over 20 years, worked at public, private, co-ed, single-sex, religious, independent, altruistic and soulless colleges. The same characters appear on every campus, which gave me hope that other educators would relate The Cronk’s satire. I had no idea!

In addition to editing, I’ve begun a traveling show called “There’s Something Funny about Higher Education,” in which small teams of educators use elements of humor as a springboard for innovation. Next summer I will tour with that workshop and another one called “There’s Something Funny about Assessment.” Assessment and humor? You know that’s possible, right?

What’s on your minds these days, student affairs?"

When is it time to move on?,"What are the signs that you’re not getting a promotion ever at your institution and that you should move elsewhere to either try and advance your career or get out of higher ed altogether?

I’m losing hope in my job search and I don’t know what to do.,"This is a throw away account for obvious reasons. I have been job searching in Student Affairs for almost 8 months now and I just got my masters degree. I’ve changed my resume, my interview style, and everything I can think of, and I’m still getting nowhere. Every place I’ve been rejected from has said “your just not the right fit for us” and I’m sick of it. I feel like I have wasted 2 years of my life getting a degree in a field that does not want me. I seriously don’t know if I should keep trying, get some additional help (I’ve used 3 job coaches over the course of 6 months), or just quit higher education altogether and search for some other job. No matter what, I could really use some advice."
Higher Education Job Search Stories,"Given that we're entering the peak hiring time, and a lot of the soon to be new grads are going to various hiring conferences (i.e. TPE, OPE, etc) and actively searching, I figured it would be fun for people to share some of their craziest/funniest/weirdest job search or interview stories. I'm going through a particularly brutal job search right now (I've been applying for about a year), so my selfish reasons for this is that hopefully it will cheer me up...?

Can I get a breakdown of NACA/ACUHO-I/NODA summer internships?,"Howdy all, 

I'm a first year grad in a student affairs administration program, currently GAing in housing. I don't really know what my goals are long-term job wise upon graduation, but hoping to get a better breadth of experience the next few semesters.

I'm a little confused on what all the summer internship programs are (one is required for my program). Obviously, I'm somewhat familiar with ACUHO-I, but NACA and NODA are two programs I've been recommended, but have no idea what they really are. Could anyone give me rough breakdown of what they are, are they paid, time commitments, etc.? I think that'd be really helpful!"
Anyone want to trade mock interviews?,Hi all! I have an interview for an academic advising position coming up and I'd love to do a practice interview beforehand.

Let me know if you're interested.
Death by a thousand cuts by supervisor. Finally stood up for myself.,"My boss left in February and I was asked to take her position. I would’ve gotten a raise, had a longer commute, and supervised two older men who clearly had a problem with me (one more thank the other). When I was going to say yes to the position, I got a call saying the position changed so that I wouldn’t supervise, the raise was being taken away, and I would still need to go farther for a commute. I was also told that if I didn’t accept the position, they would NOT offer it to my coworkers but they have one person in mind at the institution they’ll offer it to and then look outward.
I decided to say no because I didn’t want to add an hour on my commute for no raise. They offered it to the internal person who trained for a day then decided it was overwhelming and rejected the offer.

They then hired a totally new position: a non academic Dean. The dean talked to me about the office and I told her that I denied the position because xyz. Then they ended up offering to the person they said they wouldn’t offer it to: my colleague who has more of a problem with me because of my age and/or gender. Ever since he got that position he puts my ideas or actions down unnecessarily. Usually he doesn’t copy the dean unless he thinks he’s clearly in the right, and then he copies literally everyone and their moms unnecessarily.
In the transition he very poorly passed most of his students to me to advise, to which he didn’t provide any information other than names and majors to which both or one were incorrect. Keep in mind we’re already two weeks into registration. Come to find out he incorrectly advised many students, but his response when we ask for more information is “well they’re your students now, figure it out and build a rapport.” Which is causing more harm than good right now.

It’s one email or conference call after another that he “gives me a paper cut.” One isn’t a big deal, but they get annoying and kill my mental healthy after a while. My colleague is getting similar but not as often passive aggressive and emails that put him down as well. Our boss would always come back super defensive. I’ve tried being nice, being formal, being informal, being detailed, being vague. Literally every approach comes back with a slap in the face. But nothing extreme enough to bring to HR. 

So finally Friday, I decided to stand up for myself. My boss sent me an email and copied my colleague and one Of my new advisers that my boss transitioned to me last minute. He says to the student, please write up the problem you told me about (instead of my boss helping and providing the problem) and introduced me as the advisor. The says that my colleague is the expert, so he can help too.

Both my colleague and I work with military affiliated students. We are both “experts.” Now my boss has painted this picture that the student should go to my colleague not me, their advisor. My boss has also said to me “you’re not an expert” and has created the precedence that I can’t handle my students. If I need help, I always reach out. He has shown me that he doesn’t believe in my knowledge. And now I can see the student now knowing who to go to because he has been told that his advisor doesn’t have the knowledge to help, when I might. If I ever don’t, I always tell the student I’ll find out.

Now I’m anxious to hear the passive aggressive response. I’m interested to see how he spins this pin me. My previous boss to me to be careful (after she left). I’m just tired of the constant push back when I provide information or ideas. I’ve been looking for a new job for months (he was an awful coworker and I was always wary around him), but I literally can’t do anything else right now.

They’ll never fire him without significant cause. My coworkers feels similar to me, but he is just existing. I think I have more respect for myself and I know I don’t deserve this treatment. I have no idea if it’s because I’m a woman or if it’s because I’m half his age or because of my knowledge. No clue.

Any advice moving forward? Has anyone gone to HR for a similar situation where it wasn’t one significant thing but a thousand small things? I would quit,  but I need to pay my student loans first."

You are your best advocate! Good luck in the job search!,"I have seen quite a few posts here and in some other SA forums that I belong to asking advice regarding the job search or negotiating job offers, etc.

My unsolicited advice for anyone looking or anyone in the SA field thinking about looking ... you are your own best advocate!

I think we do the field a disservice by acting like higher ed is so altruistic and a huge family that wants to help everyone out.  I have great relationships with some of my coworkers, but higher ed is a business just like anything else.  I’ve worked in the field long enough to see budget cuts, RIFs, reorgs, etc.  

Even with the most supportive supervisor, business decisions still get made, and you are the only person who is unequivocally your advocate!

So don’t be afraid to negotiate, ask for more, get clarity on your status of a candidate, etc.  (Of course, be professional and don’t burn bridges), but do not be afraid to advocate for yourself.  Good luck to all those still searching!  

(And I’ve worked in SA for a number of years, so always happy to provide advice via DM)"
Do I want my master's degree? I have concerns about timing and being overqualified or unemployed.,"I'm looking for some insight.

&#x200B;

I interviewed for a spot in several graduate programs and was not initially matched with an assistantship. I took this as a sign that it's not the right time, and I should pursue other opportunities.  My area of interest is advising, and I haven't found any bachelor-level jobs in my area, but there are still functional areas where I'd be content building experience that don't require a master's degree. Plus working full-time allows me to pay down my student loans.

&#x200B;

But... this week I was contacted by folks with open assistantships in my program of interest (and one of the positions is in advising). I know that if I get an offer, I will have to make a decision very quickly, and I want to have my answer prepared in the event that they do make an offer. 

&#x200B;

I've made my list of pros and cons, and it really comes down to the fact that I am hesitant about getting the degree and being either unemployed or overqualified. I follow the SA Pros group on Facebook and have been a little intimidated by the number of people who are unemployed or who have left the field. Like I mentioned before, I also have some other areas of interest that don't necessarily require a master's degree (e.g. admissions), and I wonder if I should maybe pursue a job in one of those fields before committing to the master's degree. I know that I will need to get the master's degree at some point to get the jobs I'm most interested in, but I don't know if I want to do it now or later.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have advice for making this decision? Thank you in advance. :)"
Students over utilizing services?,"tl;dr: How do I politely suggest that a student limit the number of appointments they schedule with me when they are coming in too frequently?

&#x200B;

I work as an academic advisor, and I'm not sure how to handle this situation. I want to preface this by saying that I 100% want my students to feel comfortable seeking me out as a resource whenever they need to, but I have a few students who I think are maybe scheduling *too many* advising appointments. My institution doesn't have required advising, but we recommend that students come in once per semester to make sure they are on track. I also advise an upper level program, so we also need to make sure they are meeting the admissions requirements for our program. I have one student in particular who has scheduled with me now 6 times this academic year (about once a month). Each time we aren't necessarily discussing anything new (I would say maybe 2-3 of the meetings were absolutely necessary), and some of the questions could have easily been answered via email. 

&#x200B;

Again, I want students to feel comfortable coming in, but when students do this they clog up the appointment system for other students who haven't been able to meet with me yet this semester (or this year). With this last meeting, I think I was able to gracefully suggest that he email his questions and not feel obligated to come back out for another appointment (our location is also not super convenient for students to get to). However, based on the current pattern of behavior I have a feeling he's going to schedule another appointment before the end of the semester. Has anyone ever had to delicately tell a student that they're over utilizing services?"

Self-Care for Professionals and Current Grad Students,"Hi all, I recently started at a small, predominantly medical focused institution and self-care in addition to a student first mindset is what I will be working with. I am wondering two things:

1. As professionals in the field, what are some self-care tips you do, personally or generally, to avoid burnout from helping these students and through hectic times in the office.

2. What do you have available for students to help them with self care? I know many other institutions have a wellness center and counseling center available, yet I am wondering if there are any activities that your school uses to help these medical-focused students. I’ve noticed there is more push on professional development and want to hear what others are doing or have done in the past.

TL;DR: Professional seeking help with self-care ideas for medical-focused students in small institution."

Military spouse leaving the field for two years and then want to get back,"I graduated with my masters in May 2018. We moved to Hawaii and I started a job as an academic advisor immediately. With the new supervisor my mental and emotional health has gone down the drain.
I’ve addressed my concerns with my supervisor who took no responsibility and no ownership of his inability to see me as an equal to my colleague because of my age. In Hawaii, age discrimination laws only apply to 40 and up. Not less than 30.

There is a potential opportunity to work a government job at a military base as an admin (similar pay). It has NOTHING to do with student affairs, but I need to get out, and the university system is union based. You can’t get in unless it’s at the lowest position and you work your way up. I’m well overqualified and I’m only going to be here a couple more years (no time to jump around within an institution).

Long story short: how bad would it look/would you hire someone who hasn’t been at one location for more than 2 years?

1) moved from one to another for double the pay within the university
2) went to grad school
3) this is my job after grad school
4) mentally and emotionally unhealthy because of where I’m at now

M.Ed in Higher Ed or MPA with Higher Ed specialization?,"Hello, everyone. I’m looking to go back to school to get my masters. I graduated with a BSN in 2018 and currently work as a nurse. My heart isn’t in this profession and I’ve wanted to get into student affairs/higher ed admit for a long time.

I have about 4yr experience working part-time at a registrar office during college and extensively helped students with enrollment questions and issues, and at one point was part of the scheduling and curriculum department as a sort of front desk/admin asst. I’ve also been a substitute teacher for roughly 2yr mainly working with highschool students. 

I’ve had a handful of friends/coworkers/supervisors that have MPAs and are in jobs I feel I would really enjoy, mainly all in enrollment and curriculum. I particularly am interested in the advising or admin side. I’m not sure if getting an MPA or a M.Ed would be better to start a career in student affairs (there are no M.Ed in student affairs/higher ed admin at colleges I am considering). Are there some ways to dip my toes in before even getting a masters, even though my bachelor’s and most recent work experience is in a very different field?

(Sorry is this sounds dumb. Please lmk if there are other subreddits more suitable to post this question! I’ve only really seriously considered a career in higher ed in the past few months and don’t really know where to start. Thanks for reading my text wall if you’ve got this far! ❤️)"

Current Ph.D student. Considering stopping this and transitioning into something like an academic advising role.,"Hi /r/studentaffairs!

The title gives you a general idea of the situation I am wondering about but I would love to hear any advice or thoughts you all might have as to whether or not the situation I am considering sounds feasible.

&nbsp;

Some background, I am currently in the second year of my communication and journalism Ph.d program and I have, over the past few months, come to realize that I don't think this is for me. I realized that, when I started my master's program in 2016, I was excited to teach because I wanted to play a meaningful role in the lives of students as they work to make their education *theirs*. However, over the past three and a half years of teaching I didn't quite feel like I got to play the role I wanted to as an instructor. That is to say, I enjoyed teaching and interacting with students, but I didn't feel like I had the opportunity to help students think deeply and critically about why the are working towards a degree and how they can feel a sense of ownership over both their own education as well as the reason they decided to attend college in the first place.

Having gone to community college and worked my way all the way to a paid for Ph.d program, I realized that a lot of the reason I decided to come to this program was because I wasn't sure what to do next or what role I wanted to play as a professional. All of that said I came to the realization that my own experiences as a sort of high-achieving but listless student, combined with the joy I take in helping others understand how they can bring together their strengths and their goals, are why I was excited to teach in grad school. But I only ever thought about it through a teaching lens until recently.

&nbsp;

Anyhow, the main question I want to ask is whether or not trying to transition into academic advising currently seems feasible given my experiences over the course of my graduate program. I'll provide a quick sketch of the things I think (not being super informed yet) make me a potentially decent fit:

- I have 3 years of small class, college-level teaching experience ranging from introductory classes of mostly first year students to upper level classes of juniors and seniors

- I have 2 years of experience working in the communication center at my master's institution as a communication consultant. I worked both 1:1 with students as well as with groups of students on everything from developing speeches to practicing putting thoughts in order and evaluating their own public speaking experiences. I also worked with instructors to design classes around projects focused on critical thinking, debate, and presentation skills that they could bring into their intended careers.

- As a part of the Ph.d program I am attending I became an adviser for the students in our major helping them navigate both the requirements for the majors and minors in our department (3 majors and 2 minors all told) as well as their general education requirements. By the time I finish next semester I will have 1 year of advising experience at a 4 year institution under my belt.

- I have an undergraduate degree, as well as a master's degree, in communication studies with a focus in advocacy. While I know this may not be a direct correlation to advising/student affairs I feel that I could still fit?

- While this may seem simple I am fairly tech savy. I was at one point A+ certified and, while it has lapsed (I didn't pursue a career where it would be central) I have maintained a consistent connection with technology my whole life (also having had to use it regularly in an educational context).

&nbsp;

Those are the big reasons I'm wondering if I could feasibly make the transition to advising or student affairs. Like I said, I am really looking for advice as to whether the skillset I have cultivated over the past few years would be applicable in advising/student affairs. I really don't mind starting off at a lower level/entry position either. Having been a student most of my life though, it is hard to picture not continuing along the academic track to teaching. That's why I'm seeking advice from folks with a different perspective.

Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and respond!"
"Residence Life job searching with a pet, need advice","A little bit of back story, I'm a 2nd year housing grad looking to stay in residence life in a live-on position ideally as a hall director. My current institution allows grads and live in staff to have a pet without needing ESA documentation or anything besides up to date vet records. However, I do not want to stay here and would rather end up in one of my target cities (west Washington, Denver, NYC, some others).

Now that I'm looking for jobs, I want to be sure my dog can come with me for my next move, as that's one of my non negotiables, but I'm a little unsure of how to go about finding out policies about it from every school I apply to or interview with. Also, I'm unsure of what legal aspects are involved if I decide to go the route of getting him certified as an ESA, if that opens any more doors for me or not.

Lastly, I would appreciate any advice you all have of when to communicate this concern to potential employers... During interviews, before interviews, not until the acceptance phase?

Thanks for help in advance, I can provide additional info if you need or anything wasn't clear."
I’ve lost hope in getting a job in Student Affair,"So a few months back I posted about how I was losing hope in my Student Affairs job hunt. I got a lot of great advice that I took and I really want to thank you all for the assistance. However, after another four months of searching, I’m still back at square one, and I’ve been denied jobs that I thought I would finally get. I got a rejection letter yesterday from a place I had done my very best interviewing at, and honestly it broke me. I can’t see myself finding a job in this field anymore, and no other place outside Higher Ed has even seemed to consider me for any positions. I don’t know what else to do, and all I can think of is that I will never get into the field I’ve worked hard for. Anyway, thank you for listening, and sorry to bother you."
Non student facing roles,"Hello! I am in the second year of a HEA MS program and I’m starting to think about post grad options. I started the program wanting specifically to do study abroad programs. This is still very much my focus area. I completed an internship in international student services that I also very much enjoyed. However recently I have been thinking that a non student facing role might fit me better. I care about the students obviously but I am much more task oriented than people oriented so I think I could do better work as a behind the scenes person. 

Anyone know of any roles that are non student facing but still focus on study abroad/international students?"
Seeking advice and ideas for creating a networking event for sober students and students in recovery during new student orientation,"Hello, I work at a very small, private, academically-competitive institution. For our new student orientation this year the whole division has been invited to pitch sessions on whatever topics they choose for a conference-style, pick-your-own-adventure day of orientation.

&#x200B;

I'm interested in hosting a very casual 'networking' event for sober students and students in recovery. I was wondering if anybody has experience hosting this type of event for these student populations and can offer any advice and/or ideas to help me with my goals: (1) connect students with one another, (2) give opportunity to discuss party and substance use culture at the institution and supports (hopefully I can have returning students lead this conversation), and (3) provide a fun break in the often information-dense orientation experience.

&#x200B;

I recognize that sober students and students in recovery can be two distinct student populations with different needs, but the school I work at is very small and I believe the event would be enhanced by combining them. I'm also open to the idea of pitching separate sessions, though."
It's like my students know when I need help.,"This isn't a question about student affairs, or anything crazy. Just a weird coincidence...

So, for one of my classes, I need to interview three students of a certain identity. I chose queer students of faith, so those who identify strongly with a religion or spirituality and are also lesbian/gay/bisexual/queer/asexual. I work in the campus interfaith office, so I have close contact with students of faith.

I know one queer student of faith who attends another university in the area, so I reached out to them and asked if I could interview them. They said yes! Great, now I need two more. But I'm at a loss.

TODAY, I was sitting in the office and two students comes in. They said that they want guidance to start an interfaith student org...that focuses on LGBT students because they know several LGBT students of faith and want a space for them.

Needless to say, I definitely found my other interviews. Also, I hope this serves as a helpful reminder that students make space for what they want to see, so don't be worried about creating the perfect space :)"
Career Services Job Search Resources,"Hello All

I am a new hire to a career center on a college campus and am still in the process of getting my bearings and learning a lot about the field of career counseling.

First Year Programs Interview Help,"Hi all! I am currently halfway through my Masters program in Higher Ed Administration. For this course I am currently enrolled in, I need to interview someone in the field I'm interested in going into. I cannot use someone from my undergrad or the institution I am enrolled at, unfortunately. So I am looking to see if any of you all would be willing to help! I would be looking to interview on July 21st or so (somewhat flexible) and have pre-approved questions I would be asking. I am willing to work with you on Skype, email, Zoom, whatever!!

SA masters program and OPE questions,"Hi Student Affairs! Long-time lurker here.
I'm currently looking at applying for a SA program starting next fall in either counseling with an emphasis in student affairs or higher ed administration. Essentially, just something that will help me get a GAship position, work as a Hall Director after, and eventually transition to recruiting or admissions after that wears of me for a while.

I had questions regarding OPE/TPE/SPE etc.:
First off, everyone I talked to (other RAs, HDs, Res Life admin) told me about OPE, but never mentioned any of the other ones, even though looking at online articles and sources, it seems like TPE has a bigger presence or turnout. Not sure if this is the case, but I was planning on attending OPE this spring as well as apply to some other schools that might not be there, should I plan to sign up for TPE or attend that exchange as well?

Secondly, I was a biology undergrad, honors college member, and graduated with honors, while working as RA for 1.5 years. I know major isn't a big deal for a SA program, but would I be considered a competitive candidate? (I also know a lot of that comes down to technical stuff like resumes, cover letters, interviews, etc.) but don't want to apply to really competitive programs if I'll be put towards the bottom of the pile right off the bat.

Last thing I'd have would be if anyone has suggestions for schools/programs to look into, I'd love to hear them. I've picked up quite a list of smaller schools to look at browsing old threads on this sub, but would always welcome more!"
Interview question...help with phrasing?,"Hey Folks,
I have an interview in a couple of weeks!  Yay!  It's for an Assistant Director of Student Activities at a private college and I am thinking of questions I want to ask.  

I know the college has a lot of diversity, namingly POC.  Awesome!  Loads of experience in working with students in a diverse community!  Yay!  

I know I want to ask a question regarding supporting students who may be having trouble dealing with the aftermath of the Charlottesville demonstrations.  Not only am I genuinely interested in the answer, but I want to demonstrate my focus on the student experience and support.  Iknow I don't necessarily want to inject my own opinions into the question, so I guess I need help with phrasing.  How does this sound:

""How have you noticed students reacting to the violence in Charlottesville, and what supports are in place to help those who may be struggling to cope?""

Or, should I just not touch the subject at all?  


Thanks in advance for your help!  

Warmly,

Possible SA grad student - need your advice,"Hi all,

I am an international undergraduate student in the US, and am applying for the Master's program in Student Affairs in Higher Education (or similar programs depending on the schools). Even though I'm coming in the SA program with a BBA in Actuarial Science (don't ask how or why, am sponsored for my undergraduate so kinda stuck in this major), I've worked in my university's Admissions Office since sophomore year (loved it, was why I started looking into SA) and also currently working as a part-program assistant for a volunteer group in the International Student Services office. Have also intern in education-related places (volunteered for Teach for Malaysia one summer, intern at [MACEE](http://macee.org.my) for their Fulbright/EducationUSA departments) and did a bunch of education/youth development volunteer programs like [Projek Inspirasi](http://inspirasi.avh.me) in Malaysia.

Universities I applied for (& some decisions that I've received): 

* University of Rochester (admitted, 30% tuition scholarship)
* University of Wisconsin-Madison (recommended for admission, need official transcript to finalize offer)
* Colorado State University (not invited to interview)
* Michigan State University (no results yet) 
* Anglia Ruskin University (in England, UK) (conditional offer, need minimum GPA of 3.0 by graduation next year, highly achievable).

What I'm contemplating right now is if I want to stay and pursue my Master's in the UK or in the US (if the US, I still have to decide which school, but that's a different story). Some thoughts that I consider while thinking this all out:

**1) Funding, obviously.**

While Rochester offers a 30% tuition scholarship, that will still cost me about $35,000 or so in tuition fees. For Madison, tuition cost should be roughly around the $40,000-mark or so, give an take a few thousand. Anglia Ruskin would cost me around GBP12,000, so that's around $15,000. 

I have been on a convertible loan from my country's government for my undergraduate (will probably need to pay back around 10-15% of my total costs including living expenses and all after I graduate). But for my masters, I will mostly be on personal funding (my parents agreed to help me pay for grad school) since there are not many options back home for funding for Education-related program.

**2) Time commitment**

Rochester is a two-year program. Madison is roughly 1.5 to 2 years, depending on how many credits I take per semester (30 credits for their program). Anglia Ruskin is a year-long program. While I don't mind studying for another two years, doing it in a year seems interesting but daunting at the same time.

**3) Education system**

Malaysia follows the British education system (exam-based all throughout high school), and I did A-Levels partly after high school before realizing that I hated how super exam-based it is and switched to a program and applied to the US schools for my undergrad. Super loving the US system and its flexibility, and how it offers me options I didn't know exist for me (seriously, taking a Videogames & Learning course for a Comm B requirement is awesome). But have been told that the UK Master's programs are not the same as the UK Bachelors' programs. Am planning to read up more on how the program is structured and taught, as well as talking to my friends who did Master's in the UK for their experience.

**4) Environment**

I've grown to love the US, and would love to stay and do my Master's here. Been to Rochester, loved the campus and my possible department. People are friendly, diversity is great (as a Muslim, this is highly needed). Even saw a prayer mat in the student lounge while touring and I was so excited. Madison, on the other hand, is my alma mater, and I have friends and people that I know and love. Anglia Ruskin is located in Cambridge, England, and while I've never been to Cambridge specifically, I've lived in London for 1.5 years back when I was younger, and have visited two years ago. Still have friends who are pursuing their undergraduate in England at various places, and some who will still be there if I do my Master's there next September.

The thing is, my parents are worried about me wanting to stay in the US, what with the election results and all that (as a female Muslim who wears the hijab). Personally, I've never experienced anything bad, other than that one time where a white guy suddenly yelled ""F* you"" in my face as I was walking back home (granted, it was 2am in the morning, and he was probably drunk). But my parents, not knowing how things would be next year (or the next two years), are super worried, which was why I actually applied to Anglia Ruskin.

**5) Visa requirements for dependents/spouse**

A little related to the funding issue, since I'm mostly going to be on personal funding. I am now on an F-1 student visa in the US, but would like to be on a J-1 visa for my Master's (mainly because if my spouse were to come and be with me, he can be on a J-2 visa and work part-time instead of staying at home and being idle for two years). But J-1 visa are typically for students sponsored by the university, by government or have substantial funding from anything other than personal (I am asking Rochester about their policy, since I have a 30% tuition scholarship and the form that I was given gave me an option to select J-1 instead of an F-1).

The UK, however, should be easier. As I will be on a Tier 4 student visa, my spouse should be able to come and stay with me (as I am doing a year-long Master's program) and he should be able to work (if I'm not mistaken, if you know more, please let me know!) 

**6) The program itself**

Rochester is one of my top choices because their program is a combination of Educational Administration w/ specialization in Student Affairs and Academic/Career Advising. As I would possibly like to be an education consultant in the future, this would work best with my interests. Madison's Student Affairs program is in their Ed Leadership & Policy Analysis (ELPA) program, which is more policy-based from what I've been told (though I plan to meet with my assigned advisor next semester to learn more and talk about options). Anglia Ruskin's program has a focus on international/national student affairs, which is interesting for an international student like me. It'd be interesting to see things from different countries' perspectives, and would be beneficial considering it can help me adapt to different situations, especially if I go back home and work with students who are interested to apply to schools outside of my home country. Anglia Ruskin also has a possible internship opportunity to work in the US (summer internship?) if I want to apply for it, which would also be fun.


--------

So that's just some of the thoughts I have at the moment. I would be meeting my family next week for a winter trip, and should be discussing all of the options with my parents (after all, they are paying for my education).

At this point, I'm just going through all the pros and cons in my head (and talking it out with my friends to help me think clearly), but I would appreciate any thoughts, suggestions, and ideas from anyone who has any experiences in any of these programs, or know more about the UK vs US thing.

Early thanks. :)"
Entering the field with a Bachelor's degree,"Hey everyone. I am graduating college this spring with a bachelors degree in psychology. I considered graduate school - hell, I even did months worth of research all to realize that as of right now, I do not have any interest in continuing my studies right away. I want to enter the workforce and get my life started first. What is your advice for someone in my position? I want to become hired at a college or university in advising. 

* I have 2-3 years worth of experience, including 2 summers of internships.
* This summer I wrote a 32-page proposal regarding PhD committees for the school I worked for.
* I have many courses relating to diversity and inclusion- something I know is very important to the field of higher ed and student affairs.

What is your advice? Thank you. "
Debate: When do you become a Mid-Level Professional?,"So after attending NASPA this week, some fellow older New-Professionals (we are wrapping year 4 as a pros) and I were talking about when you become a Mid-Level Professional.

Why Did You Choose Student Affairs?,"Hi,

I am a business school graduate working in technology consulting. I graduated with a degree in MIS, but I'm still not sure why I really chose MIS as a degree. Speaking freely, I have a really good GPA/résumé, so I landed a prestigious tech consulting gig making good money for a great company that I love--but my work is terrible. It has no human element. It's essentially programming for 9 or so hours a day. If I make it 5 years, then I'll get more human interaction, but I have no passion for programming. I really feel out of place. 

My passions are counseling (""helping people""), mentoring, event planning, being organized, and leadership. I was involved in leadership throughout my time at my large public university. I always felt though that going back and working for my alma mater or another school was somewhat like tapping out and saying I couldn't handle the ""real world"", no disrespect intended. (Some people perpetuate terrible myths about academia and academic support.)

Well, this past week, I've decided to say screw those who doubt me or my motivations. Screw those who say you ""should do"" this or this ""is practical"". I want to do what I want to do. And though what I hear is a ""fun"" field, student affairs and higher ed admin presents great growth opportunities, and I feel as if it draws on my personal strengths. 

All that said, I've applied for a great SA grad program, but the doubts continually creep back in. I'm at my current job for another 10 months, so I don't have to pay back my bonus and can save for grad school/survive until next fall. It's draining, but I'm learning a lot from it. 

I need your help though. Quitting a job is tough. Especially one that all of my friends and family envy. I'm sold on leaving. I'm an ENFJ, and what my responsibilities are for the first at least three years will drain my poor little ENFJ soul. And if education is my long term career path, I should just go for it. ""Decide what to be and go be it."" - The Avett Brothers. 

Oh, back to helping me. Can you share your stories and how you knew higher ed and/or student affairs was right for you. I'm really looking for encouragement as a trudge along this path towards a career that I think fits me perfectly. I'd love to hear your story though. Tell me what you love about your job. Tell me everything. It will ease my sanity. Any advice is appreciated. 

Kind regards.

Tuition waivers for Master's programs,"Hi everyone!

I'm a rising undergraduate senior, and I've been considering getting my master's in student affairs with the hopes of working in career development or academic advising. After talking to people in the profession at my university (and reading posts on this sub), I've decided I don't think I want to go to a program that doesn't waive tuition for their graduate assistants. I know that a lot of programs do this, so I wasn't too worried before, but because of the financial hits that universities are taking because of the pandemic and hiring freezes happening, I was wondering how likely it is that schools will still be able to offer tuition waivers for incoming students that would start in Fall 2021. I know that everything is very up in the air, so it's likely that people don't have the answers to that yet, but I don't want to get my hopes up too high if it looks like tuition waivers are going to become a lot less common. 

Any information about this would be a huge help! Thanks!"
What can I do to further my career in higher education while my wife is in medical school?,"**TLDR:** I'm currently pushing papers at a medical school with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field while my wife is in medical school. Due to her program, we will move in Summer 2021, Summer 2023, and possibly 2026 or 2027 to currently unknown locations with about 3 months notice for each. What can I do to stay/become competitive for better positions in Higher Ed/Student Affairs with such constraints?

**Context:** I have 5 years (2 as a student, 3 post-baccalaureate) of experience in student affairs. My first job was amazing, crossed most functional areas of the field, and I doubt I'll have another one like it until I hit mid-level career status. I applied and was accepted to a great Masters program, fully funded with tuition and stipend, but in a bitter twist of luck my wife got into medical school for the same term. Her turning it down or trying to defer while I finished a two-year program would have been career suicide, we can't do long-distance, and the schools are hours apart, so I turned down my acceptance and moved with her last summer. I got a full-time position in administration at the medical school she attends, and it pays the bills and keeps a full-time job that's technically in the field on my resume, but it's a significant step back from where I was - or at least feels like it. Competition for jobs here is fierce, and potential employers know that I'm a short-term (2 years) employee, so I'm glad that I got the job, but it's not what I want. Which leads me to our upcoming moves.

We will be here (with me in the same job) until next summer. Her program will require her to move, probably at least 2 hours away, for clinical rotations starting summer 2021 and I will come with her. Then, in summer 2023, she will graduate and we will move for residency (wherever she matches). Residency will probably last three or four years, after which we may move again.

My priorities are having a fulfilling job and getting a master's degree that will help me advance through the field. Reducing our debt load would be nice, but my wife's program will run our student debt burden into the hundreds of thousands, so really what's another 20k?

**Some of the options I've identified:**

1. There is a Master's program at the local university here, but the program is completely online, with no significant practical experiences, and no assistantships, tuition remission, or stipend. I could do it while keeping my job, and it would cost 10-15k. I would be in-progress by the time we move again (and I search for another job in our new location), and complete it sometime next year after the move.
2. Some of the possible locations for our next move (2021) have local universities, and some of those have a Master's program in my field. Some are online, some are hybrid, but most have better opportunities for funding an assistantships. The pay cut if I could get a stipend would be slight (4-8k difference from my current salary). I would get my Master's by 2022 or 2023, in time for our move for residency in 2023. But, we could end up somewhere without a program available.
3. I could just get a job at our 2021 location, hopefully one that's less administrative and more focused on my goals and trajectory, maybe paying a little bit more, and delay my education until we move for residency in 2023. I'm worried that I won't be competitive for non-administrative jobs without the Master's, so any insight on this would be nice (I'm in Southeastern US). We do get more of a choice for residency, but it's too early in her program to tell how competitive she will be (and thus how much choice we'll get to choose a location with a good program for me). We could end up back where we started, where my original program was (and I'm relatively certain they would take me back if I wanted to reapply for that program). This comes with the same uncertainty of if we don't wind up where we want, I'll have essentially wasted four years pushing paper only to wind up in relatively the same spot with no options for another three or four years, when I could have been getting a degree (even one from a less-great program).

Aside from a traditional degree and 9-5, I'd love ideas on other things to make me more competitive - online/virtual learning, conferences to attend, professional organizations to join, whatever's out there."
Can I become a academic advisor with a Masters of Arts in Teaching?,"I have my bachelors degree in environmental science. Apart from being a scientist, the two other careers Id consider are academic advising and secondary education.

Residence Advisor/Don/Staff Syllabi?,"Hi Everyone,

I am doing some research on Residence Staff courses, and I'm looking for some syllabi or course outlines from other universities/colleges. It's proving to be a bit more difficult than I thought it would be.

Placement Exchange,"Hi all! So my state (NY) holds a placement exchange at U Albany in March. I graduate from my program this May and will be looking for international services, admissions or study abroad jobs. I can’t find much information about this event but I have heard that PE’s tend to be res life focused. (I refuse to do res life.) Do you think attending would be worth it? I wouldn’t be able to attend TPE because of costs."
Timeline for Admissions,"Hi All! I applied for a program that I am really really hoping to get into a few months ago. The applications closed today so I assume they will begin reviewing them soon.

Is there a general timeline that these programs typically follow for making their admissions decisions? In general, when is the earliest and latest they might let me know?"
Preparing for Academic Advising Interview - Seeking Advice/Tips,"I have made it to the 2nd round for a academic advising job at my beloved undergrad Alma mater. The position also includes support services relevant to educational opportunity programs, specifically for disadvantaged or at-risk students. I have a BS in Psychology, and a M.Ed. in Higher Education and Student Affairs. The minimum requirements for the position are a masters in the field, and experience working with disadvantaged, at-risk, or students enrolled in educational opportunity programs. Preferred is 3 yrs experience with this population. 

I just recently graduated, so my experience is limited to my assistantship, internship, and practicum experience, however I feel that I do have experience working with this population  because of the institution I worked at (high population of low SES, high need and use of free resources, etc.). My assistantship was in Student Activities (at a Small Private Institution; Orientation, Organizations, Greek Life), my practicum in Multicultural Affairs (at a large public institution; think Diversity Retreats and program planning), and my internship in Orientation (at a different large public institution). I also advised a Sorority while in grad school (at the private institution). 

My concern is that while I broadly advised every student organization (50) in my last role, and directly advised a sorority, ... well, I  don't have any ""actual"" advising experience, when it comes to 1 on 1 student advising, especially academically related.  I would love some insights from others who have been in a similar position before. I feel 100% confident that I am able to fulfill any position put in front of me, and I sought out higher ed to become an academic adviser (my grad program wouldn't let anyone without a Masters advise students so I wasn't able to get experience in that area). I'm not an overall confident person, and I know that interviews are my weakness, so I want to make sure I am as prepared as I can be to show my abilities/skills/experience at the interview.

What can I do to prepare? What books can I read to have an edge? How can I ensure they see me ""fit"" in the position?

"Those with a PhD, EdD, EdS, what is it in and have you found it helpful in your SA career?","I’m interested in continuing my education in the next two years. There are a handful of programs that seems relevant to SA. I would eventually in like 10 years, like to teach in an SA grad program but also work as a professional."
Feeling jaded already,"So I'm now halfway through my masters program in higher ed. I'm feeling pretty cynical about the value of the program. I usually take pride in being a good student, but i just can't bring myself to be interested in my classes- they all seem the same. and on top of that I feel like I'm not being incentivized to try my best either I didn't even buy the books this semester and I've done fine. I'm working in higher ed while i do my program and I'm loving my job, so i know i'm interested in the field. Does anyone else feel this way? Any tips on pulling through?"
Is this unprofessional?,"Hi everyone! I recently applied to a job at my alma mater which I am extremely excited about. The job doesn't close for another 9 days and then of course there is the wait time while they review applications. Is it inappropriate of me to email the head of the department the job is in just to express my interest and excitement about this job opportunity? I keep going back and forth about it, so I figured I would ask for your advice. Thank you!"

Is a job in res life really my only way in?,"Hi all,

I'll try to make this brief: I have my MA in Higher Education Administration which I pursued after working many student affairs jobs in my undergrad (orientation leader, commuter assistant, program assistant, etc), and during that time I took on a GA in Residential Programming and worked at the Academic Success Center on campus as well. I now work as a Senior Program Coordinator at a College of Continuing Education at a state school campus, and while it's technically a higher ed job, I do admin work for EMS programs and it's not really why I went into the field. I really, really miss being more directly involved with student affairs. I'm trying to get back into the true student affairs game, but it's starting to feel very daunting and that my only way in is to take a res life job, which is not what I really want to do. Does anyone have any success stories that might prove otherwise? "
Questions about gap year employment,"Im currently a graduating senior and want to pursue a career in student affairs, but planned on taking a gap year before going to graduate school for higher ed. My plan is to work during my gap year but I had a couple of questions.

How feasible is it to find a job for just a year and then enter grad school? (E.g., will a place want to higher someone for just a year?)

Considering a career change into academic advising/career counseling,"Hi All! I just needed some words of advice on the field of student affairs, specifically academic advising and/or career counseling. Some background on me- I am a business marketing and management graduate and have been working in the HR field for about 4 years now. Essentially, these 4 years in the workforce have been very trial and error, but I finally have discovered my real strengths and passions. I can not see myself making a career in HR and wanting to grow myself further in that. As a result, for about a year or more now, I have been very drawn to student affairs as it aligns my strengths and passions. I will save you all that fluff and just simply ask the following questions. Answers to really any of these would be helpful to me! 

1. What advice would anyone have for trying breaking into this field? I realize this may require me to obtain a masters degree, especially having no experience in the field although I believe there are plenty of skillsets that I can apply from my HR/recruiting background. 
2. Are job prospects good for entry level grads from student affairs programs? 
3. Would academic advising be a job I could obtain right away with this degree, or would I have to work up to it?
4. Academic advising versus career counseling (at the college level). Any insight into the differences on the 2 and what may be better to go into?

Post-critical incident debriefing activity for weekly staff meeting,"This coming week, I am slated to lead the professional development activity in our weekly pro staff meeting.

Anyone done a NACA summer internship?,"I'm trying to find someone to reach out to in regards to getting a little more info about NACA summer internships, specifically for grad students. I'm currently in housing, and thinking about doing a NACA as opposed to an ACUHO-I, just to diversify and get some new experiences. However, as a housing grad, my dates are a little less flexible than others regarding when I have to be back on campus for training, and just wanted someone who has gone through the process before to ask some questions and talk a little bit more about. Also, because I don't really want to pay an application fee for something I wouldn't go through with if it isn't matching up to my expectations when I finally get deeper into the process.

Any help is appreciated, thank you!"

Interview for enrollment position in a professional studies school,"Hello,

I will be having an interview for a school of professional studies for the position of enrollment advisor.

Is this standard? It's out of my comfort zone."

If you have all A's you can get your college paid by Nicki Minaj,She is adorable. As she has never gotten to college she wants others to study.

Discovered my calling and want to become an academic adviser! Can anyone give some advice on how to start?,"Hey everyone, if you're reading this, thank you :). It's a bit lengthy, so if you stick to reading this, I appreciate you :)

TL;DR, want to be an adviser, have an opportunity at a for-profit college...

 I'm a senior majoring in History, and working on a Master's degree in International Studies as part of a combined degree program.

**BRIEF BACKGROUND**

I've had a varied work history, from a big red retail store, to working as an intern for a senator, to software QA, to my current position. I was never able to truly find my groove as you can see. I found myself wanting to be part of academia in some capacity, but never quite sure as to what or how.

I currently work at a community college as an IT lab assistant for one of the computer labs on campus, which is essentially a supervisor role for the lab in which I engage student with their inquiries and check operations.

It's a slow job, but I found that the most exciting part of the day is helping students to solve their problems and make life a little easier for them. I've came to the realization that I'd like to be an academic adviser after a lengthy conversation with my own. I've discovered it to be my own little passion.

Part of it stems from my own experiences in school, having grown up in a high-risk school in Chicago. I want people to have the opportunities I almost never had, and the opportunities many cannot be granted. 

**SO, WHAT THEN?**

I can start at Devry University during the summer as a Student Support adviser. While my mind is in it, my heart is not, considering the nature of the school as a for-profit, and the ultimate goal is *not* the student, but rather, the dollar.

I want to find myself working as an adviser in a university or community college and moving upwards to have a positive influence on a school's operations. The more I think about it, the more I want to provide students with an experience that could encourage others to be in my position.

I've considered looking at NACADA and meeting with advisers at the college I work for! Can anyone else give me some advice!

**Quick resume summary**

3.5 year total work history in (5 month retail, 2 years in software QA, interned for 3 months, 1.1 years in higher ed)

Grad School in SA or Higher Ed?,"I'm so conflicted. 

I'm trying to decide what avenue to pursue in terms of grad school (SA or Higher Ed). I really love working with students, but I also like the administrative side of things. I've been a student academic peer advisor during my undergrad (and seriously loved it), and now I work at a University Department part-time as a student services coordinator where I get to do a little student advising as well as many administrative duties. 

I fear that an SA degree isn't as prestigious (sorry, guys) as a higher ed degree, and I really have no interest in working in many areas of student affairs (basically only academic or career advising appeal to me). 

I found a program for a [graduate advising certificate](http://catalog.emich.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=21&poid=10724) which would only be a 2 semester commitment, and then if I wanted to, I could could focus on a longer higher education degree afterwards. 

I think this is the route that would best suite me and my interests, but I wanted to get your take on this. Especially what you think the value of this graduate certificate in advising is compared to say a masters in SA with a concentration in advising. 


I should add that I plan on talking to the academic advisor on staff in the department I work in, as she very well might know current trends in school, and what universities are looking for in advising applicants. 

Thank you for any and all insight!!"
Some concerns from a high schooler,"Hello /r/studentaffairs,


I am a teenager in his late teens, and naturally, I am concerned about post-secondary education. However, this isn’t about what should I expect, or any other typical questions that a high schooler has. But this is about some concerns with policies that are enforced on campuses like Penn. State, Yale, etc. Those policies are“safe spaces” (more importantly), memos about non-biased phrases, trigger warnings, and other politically correct rules. Now, I can see some legitimate grounds were these policies were established, but for the most part, it seems like this is just a way to silence opposing opinions. 


The reason why I considered this as concerning, is because from what I imagined as a college or university campus: very challenging, extremely exhausting, and yet, philosophical and a way to broaden avenues of thinking. But these safe spaces and guides to unbiased speech seems like the opposite. A way to not shield yourself, but to completely separate yourself from those very concepts. Yes, no will deny that life as a college student, or life as a whole, can be awful time-to-time at the least. But you are supposed to overcome those challenges. From those burdens and challenges, you grow a better work ethic, while thinking more critically.


Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t entirely that bad to me. I could understand that some could feel out of place and want to go to a place where they feel more comfortable. That by itself, seems like a perfectly just reason to provide safe spaces, but to be honest, I’d more inclined under a different label than “safe spaces.” But these places seem like they are used to completely remove  yourself from reality. A place where no one will criticize you, regardless if you’re in the wrong, or were giving terrible points. A place where black students can separate themselves from white students, and where female students and transgender students can separate from male students and no one else. That alone, should be highly discouraged at the minimum. This doesn’t seem like an environment that is very good for an education. I don’t think a place where my freedom of speech is restrained, and any opposing opinions I might have will be dismissed, is considered an optimal learning environment.


Anyways, I know this won’t apply to all schools. I’d imagine that you’ll won’t see protests hosted by feminists at a technical school where people earn welding certifications and engineering degrees. But am I wrong? Am I overreacting? I’d appreciate some thoughtful comments.

NASPA hashtag re: election reactions,"NASPA has created a hashtag to label articles, blogs, and resources for us to use for self care, as well as how to work this through with students. They'll also have Zoom sessions to work through with fellow SA professionals.

SA Pros - Has Anyone Participated in an Accreditation Visit?,"Hi! I've polled the /r/highereducation group about their experiences with accreditation visits at their respective institutions.

Any feedback is appreciated. Hope everyone is enjoying the summer! :)"
Career Services vs. Academic Advising,"I'm currently choosing between an internship in career services, or one in academic advising.  Which field has a better job outlook in terms of future growth, need, and pay? "
New graduate with BSc in Computer Science considering Student Affairs,"I just finished up undergrad with a BSc in Computer Science and I'm giving some consideration to going to grad school and pursuing a career in Student Affairs.

During my time at undergrad, I worked in a variety of roles at my college including working with the Admissions department and the higher-ups in Academic Affairs helping with the summer orientation sessions and training admitted students in the use of the school's online systems.  I genuinely enjoyed these experiences and I really feel comfortable with the general ""vibe"" (for lack of a better term) of the higher education work environment.

Would I be a marketable candidate for these types of positions (or grad school to begin with) considering my Computer Science undergrad?  I have spoken to a handful of former instructors and advisors, and most said they feel a tech-savvy candidate could be appealing due to the general tend towards technology in just about every aspect of higher education.

I just wanted to get some additional input and this seemed like a good place to ask!  Thanks for anything you can tell me."
So discouraged -- will I ever get a job?,"After working in Student Affairs for 5 years (and earning my Masters in Higher Ed), my husband's job relocated us to another state. It has been 2 years and I still haven't found a job. It is killing me! I've loved the opportunity to stay home with my daughter (who was 5 months old when I left my job), but I miss helping students. I've applied for countless jobs and have made it to the final 2 for a handful of positions, but haven't been selected. I'm so discouraged. My parents and husband think I should look into a different field, but I've only ever worked in Student Affairs, so I don't know what else I would be qualified for. Can any of y'all commiserate (or tell me that someone will hire me, eventually)!?"
Thinking about Leaving SA,I am thinking about leaving the Student Affairs profession.  I think my passion for it has dwindled.  Does anyone have any advice in a profession I would be able to make the transition to?  I have a Masters in Higher Education Administration.  Am I stuck working for a university/college forever?
International Student Advising- is a student affairs degree what I need?,"Hi, I'm new here.
I'm interested in working in international student services/programs for a university, most likely in the US.  I'm interested in international student advising, but I'm contemplating international student services in general, as well as programs like English for international students or study abroad (not necessarily working directly for a university).  I currently live in Japan and am also contemplating related jobs that I could do here (or overseas in general).  

So, my title question asked in a little more detail:  
I have this image in my head that advising is a very specific focus that I would need to decide on from the very beginning.  I think that international student advising is what I am most interested in but I also want to be flexible. 

Does international student advising fall under student affairs in the first place, or should I be looking at other, completely different programs, like perhaps counseling?

Will a student affairs degree with a focus on international student services/programs (as opposed to advising) allow me to do advising within that field, among other things?  

Does such flexibility/mobility within the field even exist, or do I need to have a clear job goal even within, say, international student services/programs upon applying anyway?  I know I am interested in the field, but I'm not sure I want to limit myself to advising.

I apologize if that is one too many questions at once, and I feel that I could word them a little better, but I would really appreciate any comment.  Thank you in advance."
"How do I acquire SEVIS, F1 / J1 visa international student qualifications in student affairs?","I'm currently a student affairs admin at a big public, one fairly new to the field.  I love working with international students, though they make up only a minor portion of my assigned caseload.  Looking ahead, I'd be very interested in obtaining additional qualifications that would aid me in becoming more involved with that particular student demographic.  My question is: how do I acquire the necessary qualifications?  For those of you who work with an international student population - how did you acquire the necessary knowledge base of SEVIS, immigration law, or anything else that made you qualified for your respective position?  On the job training?  Some other form of professional development?  Formal courses?  Independent study?"
Who should police college campuses?,"In reference to University of Cincinnati - Joe Deters, the Hamilton County prosecutor said ""I don't think a university should be in the policing business,""  saying he thinks the city should handle it.  This is an interesting [article on VOX] (http://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9069841/university-of-cincinnati-police), but I think it would be a bad idea. "
Update: Trying to get back into Student Affairs after 3 years in the private sector,"Thanks to some truly amazing people in this sub, I've been able to fine-tune my resume and begin my job-search in earnest.

While I was initially wanting one of two specific cities, I have since used up all possible agent slots at HigherEdJobs.com and picked 8 major cities with a large number of higher education institutions, fantastic public transportation, and generally seem like fun places to live.  My 10 job agents are Lexington and Louisville, KY to be close to family, New Orleans to stay local, New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, WA, Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA, and Philadelphia, PA.

I've gone from applying for one job a week to applying for 3 a day.  I'm excited.  I'm fully confident that by the time the next school year starts I will be back in Higher Education where I belong.

Some tips that people shared that I think deserve repeating:

- Some institutions are toxic.  Just because you had a bad experience at one institution does not mean that Student Affairs is not the field for you.  It just means that the institution its self could have been a poor fit.
- Make sure you have a career trajectory in mind.  It is far too easy (especially in this economy) to stagnate in one job and position out of fear of being unemployed.  If there is no upward mobility in a position, it might be time to look elsewhere.
- Career development and mentorship opportunities should be a key factor in selecting potential employment.  Sometimes it is worth making a little less if there is opportunity for long-term growth.

There was so much more advice given, but those aspects really stuck out to me.

Student Affairs Spring Graduate programs?!,"Hi there!

I'm currently a senior undergraduate student at UT Dallas. I'm graduating in Fall 2013, and looking for a Student Affairs program starting in Spring 2014. I've been going through NASPA's directory desperately searching for programs starting in spring but I've had very little luck thus far. Most programs I've come across start in the fall.

Do any of you know any universities off the top of your head that have programs beginning in the spring? Or any idea what I can do to find out?

So far I've contacted the following for confirmation of spring programs based on what I found or heard about: University of Central Missouri, Shepherd University, Arkansas Tech University, Bowling Green State University, Kent State

Update: I also found Spring programs so far for- University of North Texas, Texas Tech, Loyola University of Chicago, NYU, University of Arkansas, and University of Memphis.

Advertising major looking to get into student advising,"I’m a recent college graduate who majored in Advertising.

How does one improve or practice conduct skills?,"I'm in my first professional role as a Hall Director.  I love the job, but it's painfully obvious that I cannot perform the conduct piece.  Every case I have, I miss a major piece, whether it's at the scene, doing the hearing, making the decision, etc.  I just can't seem to get things right in the moment.  When outside of a conduct space, I mentally have a full grasp on it.  It's when I'm actually practicing conduct when the wheels come off the wagon.  I even just had a conversation with my supervisor, and we both agree housing is probably not a future position for me.  We've tried giving myself specific guidelines and steps to follow, special training sessions, etc, but nothing seems to be working.  I do improve in some areas, but when I do, I fall behind in others; it's like a constant state of two steps forward-two steps back.  I'm relatively content and excited to not have a housing role in the future, but I also want to show myself that I can improve; I want to have a wide range of skills I can utilize in future roles.  

Does anyone have any resources, advice, or strategies they use to help practice or improve their conduct skills?  Are there any ways to ""practice"" conduct outside of a conduct setting, because I can't exactly create conduct scenarios with which to practice."

Should I consider TPE?,"Hi Everyone!

A little background:

I am a second year graduate student (MS in Counselor Education with a focus in Student Development in Higher Education) and I am starting to prepare for the job search. I will not be able to relocate very far for this first job. This is because my partner is set up to be promoted early next year and it wouldn't be appropriate for her to transfer to another store so soon after getting the promotion. This promotion is pretty much guaranteed, she has spoken with her store manager and the district manager and has been through the necessary steps, they are just waiting until after the holiday season because she works in retail. If she does not get promoted before I start my job search, this will not be as much of an issue because she would be willing to interview for positions within her company outside of the district she currently works in.

My school's Graduate Student Association just sent out information for conference funding and I could get my travel, lodging, and registration fully funded so I am not worried about the cost of going to TPE. I am just wondering if it is worth the time if I'm not looking for jobs all over the country. 

Thank you in advance for the feedback!"
Advice for getting my foot in the door,"Hi everyone, new to this subreddit!

I never thought I would post on reddit about my current struggle but I just thought it doesn't hurt to try. 

&#x200B;

I'm currently pursuing an MS in Academic Advising from Kansas State University Global Campus. The reason why I chose this program is because it's 100% online and it will allow me to work full time (I'm at that point in my life where I cannot afford to not work full time). This would be my first semester and I loved it so far! I've known that I wanted to be an academic advisor since 2014 however, between then until now, I have not been able to secure any job in the higher education field. I know this is largely due to the fact that I have never done any job in college/university setting. All my jobs ever since I graduated in 2014 have been in social services ie: case manager for social services agency, administrative aide for housing agency, career coach for non profit and currently, career specialist for a non profit. At my current job, I work with high school students in the realms of college and career readiness. I do believe this role gave me many transferrable skills because I help these kids with college application process, FAFSA application, scholarships, etc.  

I've been at my current job for about a year and a half now and I thought, this experience would be enough for me to have at least a very basic entry level job at a university. However, it still hasn't happened. In the span of 5 years, I have managed to secure only 2 job interviews at a private university (and got rejected by the same university twice :( )

&#x200B;

Anyways, I am rambling. I guess my point is, do I even have a shot at finding a job in higher education? Is every single academic advisors and other student affairs personnels have background in higher education and that's why you are able to get a job there? Is there anyone else that's in the same boat as me? It seems like every professional that I have had informational interview with has that traditional pathway: worked as peer advisor during undergrad, got hired full time at said institution, then went back to grad school while working full time. I have yet to find anyone that works in higher ed with non traditional background, but maybe because the industry itself is not there yet?

Thank you everyone, sorry for the very long post. I'm just trying to do as much research as possible."
Need help in Higher Ed Job search,"Hi all I am asking for help today because I am really at the end of my rope. I have a BA in History and two years experience working for an AmeriCorps funded college access program run thru a university. I have been applying for jobs primarily at a University which my wife will be attending as a grad student in the fall. I have applied to at least thirty jobs and received no interviews. I am at the end of my rope. I am so scared that I will have to put my whole career on hold and work retail or something. I have applied for roles as diverse as academic advising, admin assistant, and programming staff. Just unsure how to proceed..."
When to tell potential employer about vacation?,"I’m currently looking for a new job (looking since December). I am getting married in October and already asked off two weeks for wedding + honeymoon. 

As I’m continuing the job search, should I tell potential employer about it during the interview stage or negotiating stage. I don’t want them to say no to it (because I can’t move my wedding or travel plans at this point) but I also don’t want them to say no because I’ll be gone for two weeks.

Thoughts? Advice?"
Thank you notes,Did a phone interview today with a large search committee. I was able to write down 5 of the 7 names and found emails on the institution website. Should I just send thank you notes to everyone I can contact info for? Just send one to the primary contact? Ask for the contact info for the others?
Tips on where to look for “at home” jobs?,I’m looking for a fully remote position but faculty positions are the only thing on higher education.com and I’m not sure where else to look. Any recommendations?
When to send a follow up email Vs. when to give up on an application?,I did a phone interview and was supposed to hear “early this week”. I already sent a thank you note the day I interviewed. Should I follow up expressing continued interest? Is this too over zealous? At what point do I just accept that I won’t hear from them?
Where now: advice needed,"Hi all! 
I am currently in the last stretch of my masters of HEA degree, as I’ll be completing my capstone/PC in the fall. I’m ending a graduate assistantship this upcoming month and am in the process of looking for full time positions (I can’t take another GA because I’ll only have it for one semester). 

Here’s my problem: I can’t find any jobs to even apply to, and I’ve had one interview that I choked with. I’m location bound due to medical issues and can’t find any positions that I’m eligible to apply to (think PhD requirements or 10 years+). 

What are some similar fields that I could also apply to? I’m trying to stay in higher ed long term but I need to find something for now that fits the same themes. 

Questions, advice, personal stories are welcome."
What do I do after undergrad to become an academic advisor?,"I'm currently majoring in psychology and women's and gender studies (thanks to you guys :)) and I am unsure of what comes next.

Creepy Maintenance Man,"So I won’t say my real name, but my nickname is Daisy. I’ll give my friends fake names also, to protect them. I am a student in university and I am in accommodation with 4 girls, everything is sort of going well. 

But we’ve really bad problems with this particular maintenance guy, that arrived just after Christmas, he’s very passive aggressive, rude to all 4 of us, and he’s very into special treatment of one girl, my roommate Lana, they’re from the same country and she is studying abroad. 

But it got pretty strange how the first time he came to inspect something, he just decided to sit down with Lana and her friend on the couch and make himself comfortable, and talked about how he used to pick up girls back home. 

It gets worse 

Queue him coming in for things that don’t make sense? We don’t report any problems and he literally just says “Oh I’m here to fix so-so.” But we all talk and we haven’t had any email about something needing to be fixed, and nobody has reported it. 

I remember not that long ago, Lana came in from university, and walked to the kitchen and he was just sat there; his music on full blast and said he was “taking a break because the flat down the hallway had a flood. “ Yep, that’s right, he just entered our flat when nobody was there and made himself comfy! What the fuck? 

We don’t even report any issues or technical problems, and he still comes around. Weird things he does like, leaving flour on our unit on pancake day, TWICE. 

What should I do? my other friends Amelia, and Lucy are the most willing to take action, while my other roommate, Rose who’s hardly ever here doesn’t want to because she’s leaving soon 😒 and Lana, my other roommate is very freaked out also, she’s his main focus, he comes in, let’s himself in JUST TO SEE HER? But she’s from abroad and dealing with a lot, so I don’t want to see her hurt. 

But honestly, I have no idea what this guy is capable of. He has keys to our flat door, our rooms and we’re all out most of the days, so I don’t know what he does do when we’re not here. 😬

Help!

Re-Opening A Search,"I recently had a phone interview that I thought went fairly well. I was told I would hear if I was being invited to campus in around 2 weeks. About 3 days after my interview, the job posting was reactivated with a note saying the search was re-opened. 

Has anybody been involved in a search like this? Does it generally just mean they didn’t find anyone they liked through phone interviews?"
Negotiations in Job Offer,"Has anyone ever negotiated salaries and/or a PTO/working from home/etc.  in a Student Affairs job offer?

Does the program matter?,"As I finish up my undergrad, I’ve found I have a passion for working with students (as I’m sure everyone who posts here does) and want to pursue a career in student affairs. While I plan to work for a year before going to grad school, something I’ve been curious about has been “does the program matter” when it comes to graduate schools?

When I say this I mean two things: is there a difference between M.Ed, MA, and MS regarding employability? And does the “prestige” of the school‘s program matter in the long run vs how the program itself is structured? For instance in comparing the graduate programs at UGA vs someplace like West Virginia University."
"First office arrangement/decoration tips, if you've got 'em!","I've just got my first full time position, and I'll have my first office all to myself.  I'm excited, but also understand that a badly arranged office could make for some bad mojo when meeting and working in it.  I've gotten different tips from people.  Mainly people have pointed out that it is important in terms of ecology and creating an environment conducive to our objective, and that it should suit me as I'll be in it for a long time.

I've looked around my current job, and everyone is decked out.  Some have them full of football things, some ""nerd"" things, and then some look like a dorm room designed from etsy.  I love the personality.  But I'm concerned.  As a person with a learning disability, and someone who is detail oriented by nature, I have a very hard time in spaces where there are a lot of things.  I prefer bare walls with minimal decoration - I prefer informational material, or degrees displayed.  This is how I work best and how I believe I'll deliver services to students best, but I'm worried my new boss and coworkers will see it as boring or unimaginative.  

I'm probably over thinking this, but I'd love some help.  :)"
Moving States?,"I've already finished my undergraduate degree and have started looking at different masters programs and one piece of advise that I was given from a couple of mentors working in SA is to consider going out of state for my masters. I'm currently in California and both of them, California Alumni, said that their experience out of state, in Vermont and DC, added a completely different perspective from the university systems that they were used to. I was wondering if anyone else has had the same experience or has additional insights on pursuing a program in a state that isn't where they got their undergrad."
Grad student and new to the field now unsure about SA/Higher Ed careers,"Hello. I am a graduate student in a higer education about half way through my first semester. I am doing well in the sense that so far all my grades have been very high or perfect, but I have been really stressing and obsessing over my future (which is making focusing on studying and doing my homework very difficult) and the possibility of either never landing a job or getting a job and not lasting long in this field due to ill fitting. A bit about me, after graduation(10 years ago) I had a long bout of unemployment and underemployment followed by caring for my dad as he eventually succumbed to cancer over the course of two years. To be frank, I had issues getting any kind of work due to my unemployment gaps and since I was always passionate about learning and education, I thought Higher Education admin might be a good fit for me; so, I applied and entered a program.  I can't stop thinking about how I am the only person without experience in my class and that I'm just going to end up flunking out or graduating and not having a career. That feeling of boredom and worthlessness unemployment gives me scares the fuck out of me and I can't survive it again."
International Graduate Programs?,"I’m currently a 4th year student, 2nd year Resident Assistant at my university and am starting to look into Graduate Schools for Student Affairs.

How to become an International Student Advisor,"Hi professionals in student affairs, I'm an undergrad student with a major in psychology. After I had graduated from high school I entered the workforce directly and have gained some experiences in office admin and childcare, then I decided to go back to college to pursue an undergraduate degree(so yes, I'm a bit older than kids who go to college right after graduating high school) because I wanted a career change. 

I've realized that I really want to help college students (international students in particular) succeed and give them assistance and guidance in different areas of their academic, personal and professional lives. I was wondering what I should do in order to become an International Student Advisor? Is a post-graduate degree in counseling necessary for said position? How should I build up my experience in advising/counseling? What are some entry-level positions in the International Education or Academic Advising Department? Do academic advisors' responsibilities include career counseling as well? I know that sometimes an academic advisor's duties might overlap with the career counselor's, but what are the key differences between academic advisors and career counselors in terms of required education, skills, abilities and characteristics? 

I hope to hear advices from you, thank you!"
Negotiating salaries in HE?,"Friends who work outside of SA/HE always talk about negotiating salaries, benefits, etc. but in my experience at 4 universities, people don't ""do"" this.

I was bullied out of this field.,"I love SA, I love my students.

Burnout at a new job,"Hi all,

I've worked in SA for 5 1/2 years now.  I recently finished a masters in higher ed.  Immediately after finishing, I got a new job doing similar work to what I have done previously.

Been here almost 6 months and I find that this job is greatly affecting my mental health.  I  like my coworkers but I am not using any of my previous experience or knowledge, and I am not doing the things I actually like doing.  It feels like a waste of my time, and of my employer's time.  I accepted the job because I was desperate to have a job upon receiving my degree but also thought I might be alright at it, as I had dabbled a bit in this aspect of my field.

It is hard to explain without getting too detailed but I do not believe in the work I am doing, nor do I think it is helping students.  I also have very little student interaction compared to previous jobs, and that is what truly drives me in this field.  My supervisor is also almost nonexistent, and I received little to no training for the job.  My office is very concerned with prestige and numbers, and I find the lack of 'intentionality' in our programming, as well as the lack of accessibility to students, very frustrating.  I also don't feel like I have much of a voice at my office.

I am struggling to stay afloat.  I feel crushed by anxiety, stress, and dread.  I honestly feel like I rushed into this job and need some time to decompress and put more effort into the job search during its peak (spring) when more opportunities are available.  I want to take a few months to take care of myself and be the best SA worker I can be, which I do not think I am capable of now.

Would my career in SA be destroyed if I left this job now?  Would this be a true 'burning of the bridge' and screw me over?  I want to remain in this field and also in this geographic location but man, I feel that it benefits no one (myself or my employer) for me to stay in this position.

I think I screwed up.  I am afraid of the consequences."
HR trends noticed,"Hi guys, I've been job hunting for nearly two years now (ICK). I've noticed two strange trends after interviews:
1) some places don't let you know they've gone with someone else. They literally ghost you, after you took the time to interview with them (and apply, and research, etc.) It's disturbing that SAPros would act this unprofessional in such a small field (I wouldn't recommend, for instance, applying to those places, or even going there. And I'm location-bound, so when I do get a job, I'm less likely to trust a place with my students that can't be bothered to send me a two minute email of ""thanks but no thanks"".)
2) sometimes when I don't get a job, I look back after a while to see who did. I figure it doesn't hurt to see maybe what that person has that I don't. Who I've seen lately getting hired is someone who's 50 or older getting the job, usually without a master's, OR someone who's my age but has absolutely no student affairs experience. 

My questions are: is anyone else noticing these trends? (ghosting, hiring those without experience or education, hiring those who are likely to retire sooner than later). And: what the heck can I do about any of this, if anything? Thanks in advance."
Introverted SA Functional Areas- Assistantship Selection,"I have applied for graduate schools at four institutions and now assistantships are coming out full swing. I have taken a big picture perusal of some of the different assistantships that are offered. Although I have not received official confirmation of being accepted or being invited to an interview I have begun looking at what's available. In addition, I received a lot of advice on how to pick assistantships. I was reading something on the sub and online and I saw something about introversion and being and introvert myself, I know my limits and where I can stretch myself. Now I know you may be saying, ""You have to get used to some extroversion"" which I am aware of. There are some preferences I am looking for in my work environment:

*Office- No open office environments- someone what semi-private.
*Personal connections- I desire to work with students one-on-one in advising/counseling settings. Although I can navigate small talk, it is something I do not care for.
*Areas of self-reflection where I can think, read, brainstorm, planning, writing, and reflect to help execute best practices and contribute to the office I want to work for. Also, a place where we can process thoughts and feelings
*Public speaking/Teaching- Public speaking a big weakness of mine and I know it's something that I have to improve if I ever get asked. However, doing it on a daily basis is not for me as it will dry my batteries completely. Large audiences (no. Done it before in front of 4,500+ and it was the most nerve-wracking thing ever) Teaching I would not mind doing if it were a small group setting.
*Supervision and management- Although I have expereince in it, my approach is very laid back. I lay out the expectations, and I can trust whoever I supervise that they can follow; however, I don't like being a micromanager.
*No frequent networking- I know how to turn on my extroversion when needed, but doing it everyday would be too much (this is at networking events and conferences)
*Surface level transactional advising- one word: no. Deep-interactions matter 

So I am trying to find functional areas to look for when keeping this all in mind. My initial thought for functional areas to go into are:

*counseling (an area I am interested in, not sure as a career)
*career services (I think would fit well with my goal to become a college planning consultant, this all depends on the job description asked)
*academic advising/services (Great as well!)
*Admissions & Enrollment (I think it would enhance my goals to understand about admissions, but again the public speaking in large audiences is the only thing I am concerned about. Fairs are not as much of a concern to me.
*Multiculutral Student Services (Since colleges may have different functions, I would prefer something in diversity education or peer mentoring)
*Disability Services and Resources ( Maybe something in  disability advocacy- working one on one with students and helping students meet their needs.)
*Financial Aid and Scholarships (This would be an area for practicum to aid my goal as a consultant, but may not long-term.

These are a lot of ideas I was thinking that would fit well with my introversion. I was wondering if there are any functional areas that are good for introverts that I have not considered?

Potential to finish grad program in 1 year instead of 2. Thoughts?,"So, my title is pretty self explanatory.  I have crunched the numbers and at the rate I am going with my Higher Ed program, I can easily finish by taking 1-2 classes during my summer 2018 session.  I have a Graduate Assistantship in Career Services that could be extended for a 2nd year (if needed), as well as I have been interning in Academic Advising & Career Services at another university since June.  

Upon finishing my program this July, I would have a little over 1 year of GA experience and 1 year of Internship experience in Career/Academic Advising which is what I want to pursue a career in.  I am looking to stay within the midwest but am not opposed to moving cities or nearby states, and am really open to any type of institution at this point.  I more so am worried about getting a role where I advise students in some capacity so I can continue to develop that area of my career. 

My biggest question is do you all think I should stretch my program to two years so I have 2 years of GA and Internship experiences? I am also worried that finishing in mid-july may hinder my job search process. I can do my last classes online which means I could start a job in May if they are willing to let me begin while finishing my last class of my degree.   Would it be smarter to stay in school and finish May of 2019 and just graduate with way more credits than I need to take but have more experience? I know getting into advising right out of school is tough, so I want to make the right choice but also not live the poor grad student life for another year if I do not need to.  

Thanks in advance!!!"

About to start my College Counseling & Student Development program. Advice that will help me look good for future employers?,"A bit about my background:
- I am coming into my grad program with experience in residence life, academic advising, and peer academic advising from my undergrad university. I had an internship for 2 summers at a school working with advising Masters & PhD students. 

- I am on the board of directors for a college professionals association- I help plan events and our annual conference.

- My assistantship on campus is in the advising & student transitions center. 

Keeping all of these in mind, what do you recommend I do to set myself to succeed and stand out (in the right way) once I start applying for jobs? I have been reading some other threads on this sub saying the field is extremely competitive and I want to make sure I am setting myself up for success in the field post-graduation. Any advice will help.

Ethics of requiring art students to use departmental printer,"Hey,

I was wondering what you guys thought of a policy my friend is dealing with in her department. She tells me that she is in a class that requires the students use the departmental printer for all of their design drafts and final submissions. The refusal to do so will result in the reduction of her grade. Keep in mind that each 8.5x11 PAGE printed on this printer costs $4. So, if she can get equal quality printing done for less money elsewhere she is not allowed to with this policy. 

Is this ethical? Can the professor enforce this?"
Supplemental Questions on SA Job Applications,"I'm currently job searching in SA after a rather long break from SA (roughly 5 years, because childcare is expensive in san francisco). I've noticed since my last job search efforts in 2014/15 that there's now an industry hiring standard in SA job applications to ask supplemental questions, mostly along the lines of diversity, but some are along the lines of other topics related to the job. Is this just an anomaly common in the geographical area I'm searching for jobs (Pacific Northwest) or is this common all across the country? I'm looking at both entry level SA jobs and mid-level jobs, because my experience puts me on the cusp of both those levels... yay. I kinda expect it more for upper level jobs, and not so much for fresh out of grad school jobs. 

What is the thought around this? I feel like it's half to weed out numerous applications, and half to get to know the candidate even better before you even call them for the phone interview. At the rate I'm going applying for jobs, I'm going to have a book's worth of material to write answering the supplemental questions (that's supposed to be funny, not whining!). "
"In this field, how is having degrees from the same state looked upon?","I'm a Colorado native, and I'm very proud of it.  As part of that, I've decided that since I ended up getting my undergrad and master's degrees in this state, I would also pursue my PhD here.  My goal is to attend the University of Denver's Higher Ed program.

I am interested in leaving the state, to work on campuses across the country.  Will the fact that my degrees will have been from the same state count against me?  DU is very highly renowned, and my undergrad and MA universities a little less so, but still accredited public universities.

I really never thought I'd even go to college.  Now I'm on my way to a PhD and I work in higher ed.  Thanks for your help while I try to figure this out."

Working entry level position vs. getting masters with assistantship(tuition wavier),"I'm currently working for a local college at entry level position.  The pay is pretty low, and they don't offer masters program.  I recently applied for a few grad programs with assitantship and have a really good chance of getting in.  I did read a similar post on here, but it didn't mention how it's going to be paid.  From what I hear, it's really competitive to even get into entry level position.  However, getting masters for almost free is too good to pass.  
Can GA experience substitute work experience or am I better off staying with the current position and find a way to get master's while still working?
The current institution might reimburse part of tuition as well.  But I can't help but think that I might have a better chance of getting a higher position with master's.  What would be the better choice here? "
"Have any advice, words of wisdom, tips, tricks, etc. for a new Academic Advisor?",Anything would be greatly appreciated! This is my first full-time job in student affairs :) 
Leaving a Student Affairs Position to achieve a SA Masters,"I have been working in a Student Affairs position for about 3 1/2 years now. I have been planning to leave the position so I can pursue a Masters because I would ultimately like to work in administration for a university (eventually achieving my Doctorate). 

I'm currently making about 52k a year, and probably closer to 60k if you include my travel benefits. 

I can't help but keep questioning if I'm making the right choice. Working with many people in the SA Field, I know that the positions are not well funded toward the bottom and can take a long time to work your way up to a similar salary. 

Am I wrong? Will my years in student affairs work potentially keep me from having to start at the bottom of the totem pole and maybe start toward the middle/bottom? "
Jobs Abroad,"Recently I have been thinking about my next steps and I wanted to know if anyone has any experience or knowledge in applying for jobs abroad. 

I graduated with my degree in Higher Ed a few years ago and I've been working in financial aid for slightly over at a large university. When I was applying for jobs, I recall someone talking about getting experience working abroad, particularly in Australia. This individual said there were a decent amount of opportunities there and it was a good way to build experience.

I'm in a position right now where I think I would like to continue working in the field, but I'd love the opportunity to go abroad. Does anyone know a good place to find these jobs or any resources I could use?

Thanks so much!"
Out of the field wanting back in. Help?,"Hello everyone! I have a bit of an issue right now with where I want my career to go. I graduated May 2015 with my masters in student affairs but have had no luck in finding a job. Since then I have been working in food service/retail to make ends meet but I don't know how to best communicate this in my resume/cover letter.

Any help you could give me would be very very much appreciated. "
I'm losing hope in finding a job,"Hey /r/studentaffairs, I've come to you once and now I'm back again. 

I'm honestly starting to lose all hope in finding a job in our field. I have tried so hard and honestly I feel like I'm getting nowhere. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or where to even start again. It's been a year since my graduation and I am the only one in my cohort without a job. I feel utterly worthless and unfulfilled. I work in food service just to pay the bills and hate it every day.

I've applied to positions in offices I used to work, tailored my resume and cover letters, networked the shit out of all my resources and still nothing. I ask interviewing committees what I can improve upon for future opportunities and get no reply. I feel so incredibly useless. No one I have talked to has had an issue like this. They've always been between jobs in the middle of their career. I have tried so hard and I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. 

I **love** the work that we do. I can't tell you what it makes me feel when I see our students succeed and achieve their greatest potential. I just can't understand why I can't do what I love. "
Need help deciding on a Higher Education Masters Program. And advice would help.,"I just interviewed for a graduate assistant position that unfortunately does not pay for graduate school. I'm okay with it though because I am excited about the opportunity. I started looking into programs nearby, but nothing is close enough to where I will be. Which leaves me with online programs.

Thank you in advance for the advice!

I have to make a decision between two schools one is my perfect school (I'd have to take some loans ($12k)) or go to my local public university and graduate debt free. Can you give me some advice on which route to go?,"I plan on majoring in finance and breaking into investment banking after University. 

So I got accepted into Trinity University and the University of Houston. Trinity University costs $52k a year tuition, room, board, and fees. However I was awarded enough to make it cost $19k a year, but part of of my award money is a $12k scholarship. UH tuition and fees and food and activities is about $13.5k a year and I'd be staying at home and commuting to campus. 

I like everything there is at Trinity, if I go there I will be recruited by the swim team, and get to continue swimming which I absolutely love. I also love the small class sizes and small campus at Trinity, and the fact that I would be able to get away from home. 

In both cases my parents will cover tuition costs up to about $15k, but that is all they can afford. So I'll have to work a summer job to get some extra money for trinity, which I'm fine doing. I'll also have to graduate with some student loans.

My plan to pay off my student loans is to work in Houston after graduation and live with my parents till I pay off all my loans. 

Is Trinity University worth taking out a loan for?"
What Higher Education Admin./Student Affairs Graduate Programs still have a deadline that has not passed?,"Hello! I recently decided to go into student affairs after college, so I was wondering what schools still have the deadline coming up for the graduate programs.  I am open to anywhere in the country! (USA)

Craziest student affairs story,"I am currently a hall director (on year 7), and I am doing research on a number of different facets of the hall director role and I thought it would be helpful to know some of the things student affairs professionals deal with that many may or may not know considering the work we do. It can run the gamut of interactions with students, supervisors, duty stories , certain ways your department functions, etc. You don't have to use specific names or your institution. If I can get enough material to compose into a research paper, or even a book, I would change names and institutions anyway. 

If nothing else, I thought it would be fun to share among us"

Would you accept a newly-created Hall Director position when the students are avidly opposed to the creation of your position? (x-post /r/reslife),"I'm interviewing for a live-in, full time Hall Director position in a residence hall at an ""elite"" private university. At first I was really excited because the university's students have a reputation for being very smart and creative. However, the Hall Director position is new - my understanding is that historically, faculty and graduate students without professional Student Affairs training lived in the dorms and fulfilled some of the functions of a Hall Director. The university has been phasing Hall Directors in over the past few years, receiving what I have heard and read appears to be a fair amount of resistance from students as well as the live-in faculty and graduate students. 

They have left the most resistant residence halls for last, and I'm interviewing for one of those positions. I'm worried that it will be a hostile work environment, as there appears to be a lot of tension between students and ResLife staff. 

During the interviews I have been trying to better understand the environment, but everything is very polarized and the other ResLife staff just seem to be of the opinion that the students are not reasonable and I shouldn't pay them much attention when deciding whether to accept the job. But, my job is supposedly to work with these students!

Has anyone ever faced this? What questions should I ask during the interview process to help understand this situation better, and make the best decision for me and my optimal career advancement?  "

Career Transition to Student Affairs,How difficult can it be to transition to a staff position in student life/Affairs or service learning coming from the non profit world without a Master's degree? I have about 15 years experience in social service and community work focusing on youth mentoring and college/career prep programs.
On-Campus Interviews,"So I am flying out tomorrow for an on-campus interview. Woo! I'm very excited, but this is only my second time with this style of interview. The last time I interviewed with an institution I learned quite a bit about how to prepare and what to expect during the process, but I'm still quite inexperienced with this process. I feel very confident that I will fit in with staff, but I'd like to know if there is anything that I can do to better prepare myself for this interview.

Also I am planning to wear slacks with a button down and tie, but no blazer. Is this proper attire, or should I plan on wearing the blazer?

Thank you for any tips you can give me!"

Why Should I Create a Reddit Account for This?,"Reddit is a dynamic place where the community gets to curate the content.  Posts (questions, topics, links, etc.) that are popular move to the top and don't get swallowed up based on when they were submitted.  

You can have longer text responses like a blog post, but with the community interaction that people love about Twitter.  Plus all the related reflections are compiled instead of being across scattered blogs.  

Take your time to submit a thorough answer - there's no timelines!  That's especially helpful for those people who need more time to process & reflect before responding, or who want to be able to cite/provide links.

Within a post, certain comments can be moved up or down, kind of like the amplifying effect of a RT on Twitter.

Job search tips?,"Hey everyone, 

I was hoping some of you may have tips for job searching. I graduated from my program in May and since my job search process started I've only managed to get a couple interviews and I'm not quite sure if I'm doing something wrong or if it's the fact I went straight from undergrad -> Master's route, some combination of both, or just the increasing competition within the field.

Any tips, leads, etc would be much appreciated! So far I've been relying on HigherEdJobs, occasionally HERC, and local college HR pages. "
"Looking at switching from ""academia"" to ""higher education"".","I'm currently finishing up my Master's in Linguistics. After considering switching to Anthropology because I'm interested in identity, especially multicultural and minority identities, I've decided that the path to a tenured position just isn't in me and I would be better off working directly with the communities that I would like to work with by going into student affairs and higher education.

As an undergrad I was hired as an early hire (freshman year) as a paraprofessional (RA) for a few years and was a Resident Manager, managing three residence hall desks at The Ohio State Univeristy. I loved my years in housing and would love to return to doing work that is similar to that (though I completely understand that running a multicultural center or being a hall director is far beyond being responsible for 72 residents as an RA). 

I was wondering what programs (Master's) you could point me to that are strong in research and in implementing programs for diversity and multiculturalism. I'd like to pursue a Master's in Higher Ed and work in housing or some other part of student affairs a while and then perhaps eventually pursue a PhD. I think my dream would to some day run a Multicultural Center or a LGBT+ Center. 

Specifically I'm interested in working with gender and sexual minorities as well as with Native Americans. I'm studying out west at the University of Utah and while I'm not working in student affairs, I've been working closely for the past three years with the Shoshone People. One thing that I'd like to look into (and maybe I'm being too academic as I'm not sure how much Higher Ed master programs are research based) is the recruitment of Native students to schools in the East that don't have large native populations (as compared to the University of Utah whose mascot is named after the major tribe of Utah, the Utes). 

Any suggestions as to programs I should look at or people I should look into would be helpful. Also any advice from those who switched paths from something else into higher ed would be encouraging as well. It's been a long and tiresome road to decide what I want to do with my life and the more I think about it, the more I feel I belong down this path. "
"Student organization making money on school's campus using school's name, hiding profits from school. I don't think it's money laundering, but could the school sue us? (x-post from r/legaladvice)","I work for a campus organization that hosts events that bring in 100k+ each year. Usually that money goes into our school account but the school limits how we spend that money. We recently set up a 501c3 non-profit and now about half of our revenue goes into that account (conference attendees pay directly to the non-profit rather than the school). That non-profit-- the board is made up of young alumni-- then buys us things that the school would otherwise regulate like plane tickets, vendor contracts, etc.
My concern is that we are making money using the school's name and the school's facilities and not declaring it in anyway. We are acting as agents of the university when we put on these conferences. While we have an account with the school, it is technically their money, right? Could the school conceivably sue the non-profit for the money that would have otherwise gone to them?"
Gender neutral titles and forms of address in student affairs?,"So I just interviewed with a school last week and realized both while interviewing and as I'm working on those thank you cards, I'm not sure how to address folks.

Taking a shot in the dark here. Advice?,"Hey everyone, 

Looking for some advice here. I'm down to two schools for my SA masters, lets call them ""White"" and ""Red"" (disguising their identities just in case). The deadline to choose between schools is quickly approaching, April 15.

I'm one of three finalists for a Hall Director position at ""Red,"" and I feel preeeety confident about it. I interviewed for five GA positions at ""White,"" and I didn't get any of them. However, I feel more comfortable at White... And it's really where I want to be. But I worry about not having a GA Position, and not being able to find one on campus. 

Anyone have any advice on what to do/where you might choose? Ways to find a different GA or Full-Time position?

SA grad student looking for a little input from current professionals,"Hey all! So excited I found this subreddit...typed in r/studentaffairs expecting ""page not found"" to pop up, so presently surprised :)

I'm a 2nd year SA/HE grad student at a small university in WV and am currently taking Governance as one of my classes.  Our main project for this class is (in groups) to create our own university.  This involves everything from naming and mission statement to budget and assessment.   I'm hoping that some people might not mind sharing some information about their schools with me so I can get a good idea of what other institutions do?  Feel free to PM if you don't want it out here.  

I've googled a lot of schools and read a lot of websites, but a lot of times it can be difficult to find what I want.  My part of the project is: resource/budget, administration/staffing, campus culture/environment, and assessment.  We also cover goals/strategic planning, org governance, student affairs division (support offered, services available, etc.).  Basically everything within a university, but with a specific look at student affairs (since that's what our program is based on).  

Our created school is a 4 year, public, D1 institution located in Delaware with about 4,000 undergrad and 1,200 grad students.  I'm looking for information about all types of schools though!  Do you have a cool organization structure in your department?  Do you have a unique fundraising idea that your school implements?  Do you have any unique assessment tools that you use? Basically anything at all you want to share about your institution would be greatly appreciated. 

Obviously I am doing additional research with this and will be further looking into everything you say, so don't think I'm just trying to have someone do the work for me haha.  It's just that there's so many different colleges and universities out there that I figured a good way to narrow it down a bit and see some cool ideas/suggestions would be to ask Reddit :)"
Preparing for online graduate school,"Hi y’all!
I’m super excited to start graduate school this fall, but by the looks of it, it appears my higher ed program will be online for the first semester.

 I really like the hands-on experiential aspect of a student affairs masters, as well as the funding that comes with it, but I am wondering if my interests are better suited to an MPA program.

Is it plausible I could have both these potential career paths open to me if I do a Student Affairs masters?"
How does your U handle keys / lockouts?,"I'm curious what other U's do!

**Context:** Private, 4yr, \~130 residential students in 4 buildings. 8 RA's, 2 FT Resident Directors live on site. It's also worth noting that our RDs are  hourly, so there is some gray area on asking them to be available for lockouts 24/7, by gray area I mean I'm not sure it's legal unless we pay them for all those hours :)

**Lockouts**: Right now, between RAs and RDs we generally handle students locked out or their room or building from 7am-midnight. Campus Safety has 24-hour staff so they handle 12am-7am. We have lockboxes in each building that house all the backup keys for each room, we have to access the RA office, get the proper key out of the lockbox and then return it. Neither RAs or RDs are allowed to have master or sub-master keys. 

I would prefer a world in which RDs have master keys (access all campus) and RA's have a sub-master for just their building. Then I'd like Campus Safety to issue all resident keys (so we don't have \~100+ keys in each of our lockboxes). This seems like it would be the normal practice but as it stands, Res Life (RDs) issue and attempt to keep track of all resident keys and their backups.

**Questions:**

Who issues and charges for lost keys at your U?

Who handles lockouts? and during what times?

What role does Campus Safety play in these categories?

Graduate Assistantship Interview Tips,"Hi folks! I recently got admitted to Pitt’s Higher Education Management MEd program, and I’m so excited! I fell in love with higher education when I got to my undergrad institution, and knew it was the career path I wanted to follow ever since I became involved with my university’s office of admissions.

In order to get a chance at receiving a fully-funded GA position, I have two days of interviews at Pitt’s campus. I’m nervous because there’s a lot on the line for me- I’m a first generation college student who doesn’t want to take out more loans. There are only a few GA positions available (full tuition remission + $16K stipend and benefits), and they are quintessential for me to get since I’m an out of state student.

What advice do you have? I want to eventually get my PhD in higher ed doing research on first gen students, and I want that to come across in my interview. I’ve already reached out to a lot of the faculty at Pitt, including my dean, advisor, enrollment manager, and program director to introduce myself. What questions should I ask? What experiences should I highlight? 

TL;DR: Recently admitted Pitt MEd student who is a few weeks away from GA interviews. There aren’t a lot of GA positions available, and I need one to afford this program, so what will make me a viable candidate that stands out during their interview?"
Resume review?,Anyone want to help a girl out and look over my resume? Preferably someone with experience hiring new professionals and experience with ResLife as that’s my functional area of choice.

Applying to a RD and a ARD role at the same school? Red flags?,"So, second-year grad checking in. Job search basically in full swing. There's a school I'd really like to work at, with positions as an RD and ARD posted on their job board. I will be finishing with a MS in Educational Administration. Does that mean I'm probably over-qualified for the ARD role? The school only has bachelor's required for that position, with no mention of a Master's. Would it look bad if I submitted essentially the same application (changing wording/titles/etc.) for both positions since it's probably the same hiring committee? 

For context, I really want to land in one of my preferred geographic areas (Seattle area/Western Wash, Denver, a few others) but don't want to seem like I'm desperate. The ARD position pays well enough that I'm certainly considering it, but a little concerned about what the process might look like if I apply for both positions."
Assistantships in higher ed,"Hey, y’all!

Hourly Resident Directors & Labor Laws,"Hello!

(These are USA specific questions since they involve labor laws but happy to hear from a broader range of inputs as well)

A few questions surrounding this.

1. Is anyone else doing hourly (FT) Resident Directors?
2. If so, how have you navigated providing Res. Life coverage / services over extended breaks where time-off is required like Winter, Summer, etc?
3. If your University is not using hourly Resident Directors, are they including the value of campus housing and other benefits to meet minimum FLSA salary requirements?

Edit\* Talking about live-in Resident Director / Hall director roles

One article I'm referencing: [https://www.wagehourinsights.com/2016/06/residence-hall-directors-under-the-new-flsa-exemption-rules/](https://www.wagehourinsights.com/2016/06/residence-hall-directors-under-the-new-flsa-exemption-rules/)"
Fear of getting stuck...," For background, I graduated with a BA in management from a small private college in MN in 2018. After graduation, I was hired as a Housing Director at a very small college. After this year, I will have two years of experience under my belt in residential life. Additionally— this year, I have an additional position in academic retention. I have been accepted to my top choice grad program for the fall of 2020. I know that I am qualified for a graduate assistantship in residential life, which would come with free housing. Because I know I will have very limited income as a grad student, free housing is a huge draw. BUT, if I have learned anything in my time as a Housing Director, it is that housing/res life is NOT my passion. I would love to never have to work in res life again. SO— my question is, with the two years of experience in res life, and an assistantship in the same area, would I be condemning myself to a career working in res life? How hard would it be for me to get out of res life if I were interested in moving into campus activities type work?

Thanks so much in advance!"

SA Professionals relationship with EdTech,"Hi all!

I have a Higher Ed masters but my career is currently in K12/higher-ed edtech due to personal reasons + visa sponsorship issues.

What I've noticed when I reach out to higher ed professionals is an overall distrust in Edtech tools. This might be warranted due to the many tools that exist on the market or pushy salespeople who don't understand their users. 

For those who have purchased or partnered with external tools/platforms to support their work, I'd love to have your advice on what's most important to you when deciding whether to use/buy a tool and/or when recommending a tool to your students.

"Clubs & Programming - purchases, contracts, etc","I work at a large urban college in a large city.

Genuinely curious about how your institutions handle spending money for goods/services. I've been at my place for about two years and I'm getting increasingly frustrated at the bureaucracy making it almost impossible to order anything for student clubs. This goes for simple things like food and party decorations, as well as signing major contracts.

How does your school handle these? Do you pay everything by PO? Do you have a departmental credit card that you/your clubs can use? Are you even allowed to do purchasing yourself, or does a separate office have to handle it? How long does this process usually take for you?

Letters of Rec 3 (going on 4) Years out of Undergrad...Advice?,"Hello,

I will be applying for SAHE programs this fall. I am 3 (going on 4) years out of my undergraduate degree, working in finance, and looking to make the career shift to align more with my passions/career goals.

As I’ve started looking at application requirements, almost all programs request at least 1 (some even 2) letters of recommendation from a faculty member. 

Now I did well in college and I could definitely get letters from old professors, but I do not feel like they would best recommend my strengths, growth, ability to excel in the programs, etc. This is mainly because it has been 3-7 years since some of them taught me and I feel like I have numerous other mentors that would be able to give a more accurate insight into my academics, character, and work ethic. 

Does anyone have any insight into this? 
Anyone been in this position or any admissions pros have any advice?

Would it make sense to reach out to the university as I apply to explain my situation?

Please let me know what you think!"
Looking for thoughts and info on Slippery Rock's dual program in Student Affairs and College Counselling,"Program: http://www.sru.edu/academics/graduate-programs/student-affairs-in-higher-education-with-college-counseling-master-of-arts

Context: Im entering my senior year of undergrad with a degree in Communication Sciences and Disorders.

I have never seen something like this before. Im starting to fall in love with it. Its a 3 year program that is essentially a student affairs degree merged with a clinical counseling degree. I dont know the logistics and if it is counted as a degree in both? Im really passionate about mental health in college students. Its the reason I got into student affairs and want to pursue it as a career. My only concern with the program is financial-- Ive been looking into full tuition waivers and housing positions because Im not sure I can afford the debt-- and everyone and their mother says a student affairs degree isnt worth paying for.

What do you think? Any experience with this type of thing? Im just trying to get all the info I can."
Need help tailoring poster proposal for NASPA 2019.,"I am currently working on submitting a program proposal for NASPA 2019 but the format doesn't feel right.

Worried about not getting an assistantship,"Hey everyone, I recently decided to take the student affairs track with 1 year left in undergrad. It’s my mission in life to help students that were like me when I started college. I’m worried that I won’t get an assistantship, and end up lost not knowing what to do after.

I have lots of residence life experience, such as being a hall council exec member, desk assistant, Resident Assistant, Residence Hall Association exec board(attended housing conferences), National Residence Hall honorary president. I did summer orientation two years in a row as well as first week orientation two years in a row. I have undergrad research experience in special education(my former field), and I’m also participating in a unique internship this coming year that involves training service dogs on campus.

For whatever it’s worth, I’m hearing impaired and can reflect on my experiences being differently abled(and helping students who are the same way, as I planned to be a speech pathologist)

Can I just get your thoughts on my experience? It’s so difficult for me to find info and to measure my chances. I like to plan ahead and feel as secure as I can. There’s a placement exchange program in the spring that I’ll go to and I also plan on applying to a couple schools outside of that that require GAs. My goal is to get into housing with full tuition waiver."
Books/Resources on Student Affairs in Higher Education?,"Hi there! 

I’m looking to switch careers and get my masters in higher ed/student affairs. I was very involved in residence life as an undergrad (RA, FM, mentor, etc.), so I have a good idea of what it’s like from a student perspective; however, before I completely switch gears I’d like to read about the field from an academic lens. Learn about the general field, the specialties, subsets, challenges, changes, etc.

Any book, article, journal, publication, blog, website recommendations? 

I won’t be applying till the fall for programs, so I have lots of time to research. I’ve reached out to mentors at my undergrad and they’re helpful, just figured I’d get a more general point of view. 

Thanks!"
Question for Admissions Counselors,"Currently work as an admissions counselor and I am unable to request off over 20 weeks of the year. While I expected there to be ""black out"" periods where I couldn't request off, is 20 weeks out of the year industry norm?

Is a masters program worthwhile if you can afford the tuition but were not able to secure an assistantship?,"I was accepted into a higher ed masters program for this fall (background is I have no experience in the field) but I did not receive any offers for the assistantships I applied to. Now I have seen many people in higher education comment on how this is not a degree to go into debt for but I can pay for the entire program with the money I have saved. What worries me is missing out on the experience, both in terms of personal growth and my CV. "
I went to TPE and the lack of follow up has made me a mess,"I have anxiety, which has elevated pretty severely during this search. I went to TPE, had excellent interviews, but haven't heard back from most of the institutions. These 3 are the ones I'm most confused by:

School #1: had all interviews at TPE. Got a follow up interview with director last week, went great. They want to schedule flyouts next week, but I haven't heard back. 
School #2: both rounds at TPE. Director sent a thank you note saying the look forward to possibly scheduling a campus visit with me. Since then....nothing
School #3: stayed late to fit into my schedule to have a final interview, said they couldn't wait to have me on campus. Again, nothing since.

What's happening?! I wish this didn't freak me out so badly, but I am so used to being straight-forward and communicative. Anxiety and job hunting do not mix. "
Which is most beneficial: Masters or Ed.D/Ph.D. in Higher Education?,"Would it be better to get a Masters of Higher Education coming straight out of undergrad or getting an Ed.D or Ph.D. in Higher Education? I want to be as high as I can in a university, and am extremely ambitious.

First time applying to SA jobs and I'm overwhelmed,"Hi all,

I've been looking at jobs in other states because California is too expensive and I'm ready for a change. I've reached out to others in the field and they all just refer me back to higheredjobs, which is a great resource, but also an online pit of applications. Is this really the only way to SA jobs?

International experience?,"I am a first year grad student, literally am starting classes in two weeks, for student affairs. I am so excited to be in this field, I have an assistantship in my schools interfaith office.

But my question is has anyone done anything internationally? I am going to be looking into a housing practicum over the summer, probably through ACUHOi.

Anyone in a Chicago or suburban Chicago area? Hitting dead ends all over the place and I'm feeling insecure.,"Hello all,

I made a post recently on critiquing my resume, which I received wonderful feedback on. I'm posting today because quite frankly, I'm stuck. I posted on being an Academic Advisor but was instructed to start smaller, somewhere like admissions.

Well, the only opening available for admissions that I seem to have good odds with is at DeVry. Needless to say, it's DeVry. You're more of a salesperson and every person I've talked to about DeVry  has instructed me to stay far, far, away.

That's left me in a conundrum. I work at a University in a student position, but I want to do something more. I have my BA and I'm a few months away from my MA, yet I feel as if there's just absolutely no opening available right now.

Could anyone (especially a Chicagoan), give any advice as to how the hell to succeed?

Using a nursing degree in Student Affairs?,"Hi everyone, 

I have a little different situation that I haven't really seen anyone ask here. I graduated from a small college with a Nursing degree. During my time there, I was an RA, and learned that I wanted to continue in SA against my nursing degree. I then become an Assistant Residence Director while I worked on my Masters in Nurse Education. About 6 months into this position, I was offered a position as a Residence Director.

Since then, I have completed my masters degree, and still work as an RD. I enjoy what I do, and the people I work with, however have completely grown out of the ""Live-in"" scenario of an RD. I'm now looking into new positions that I can hopefully incorporate the last 6 years of my school life.

My question to you all is: Are there any Student Affair positions out there that I could incorporate my nursing degrees into to?

I am located north of Boston, MA, if that helps anyone. Thanks!!"
Trying to re-enter Student Affairs job market,"I've been out of student affairs for the past 6 years, and while I've lightly kept up to date on news, events, and trends, I feel like I'm kind of clueless of where to look for jobs (either it's changed where jobs are being posted online, or maybe there aren't as many job openings going on this year). I've been looking on Chronicle's job search website (Vitae) and Inside Higher Ed.

Grad school or gap year(s)? [long post],"Hi everyone. (this is going to be a long post and I sincerely apologize for this)

Last time I posted about needing some advice about potential grad school options [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/5in04c/possible_sa_grad_student_need_your_advice/), and some of the comments have been helpful.

So my decision, after talking to my parents and some professors/supervisors about it, was to go ahead with the offer from Rochester (for their Educational Administration w/ concentration in SA and Academic/Career Advising), but deferring my enrollment to January 2018 instead of the original August 2017.

Reasons for deferral:

* 1) I will be graduating in mid-May, and would be returning home sometime in early June (after getting all my things sorted with the lease and the phone/internet plans and all that. Rochester's program would have me attending orientation in mid-August. I plan to come to Rochester at least a week earlier to settle in & everything, so that would have me returning to the US in early August.

So that leaves me with less than two months to rest at home, and after four years of leaving my country to study in the US (& only going home for the summers), I don't think it would be enough. & my grandmothers would definitely be mad if I'm only home for a little while.

* 2) With what's going on after the inauguration and everything, my parents are a little worried about me staying in the US, so they want to see how things are going to be in the next couple of months and see if it gets better/worse.

* 3) Funding wise. Currently parents are supporting my brother on his master's in Scotland, and he would be finishing in Sept/October. Thought it would be better to let him finish first before they start worrying about funding my master's program (since I would at least be on personal funding for the first few months at least while I try to get an assistantship/job).

However, I am also currently looking at opportunities to work in Malaysia in the SA / Higher Ed sector that would accept my BBA degree without my Master's. I've asked a couple of people in the industry, and they said that it is not a requirement to actually have a Master's degree in SA/Higher Ed to work in the industry. But from some of the job positions posted online, I realize that once you want to go higher up the career path, the Master's would be useful/a requirement to have.

So I was thinking if I should just put a hold on my decision to go to graduate school, & work on getting some experiences first back home (OPT is not an option for me to stay in the US, as I am a BBA holder and I won't be able to work in SA, even if I can find one). I've already applied to multiple SA/Higher Ed jobs (in colleges back home, in private education consulting companies, etc), and have gotten some good replies (though most of them are recruiting for immediate positions, but they do ask me to get in touch with them again once I'm back home in June). I also applied for Teach for Malaysia (equivalent to Teach for America, a 2-year teaching/leadership program), which I'm highly likely to get an offer from considering how I volunteered with them two summers ago and that they fast-tracked my application to the final stage without going through the online assessment and everything.

What do you think? Would you recommend taking a few years off to work / find experiences, or to go straight to grad school? I've probably had about 2.5 years of experience in SA (in the Admissions Office), but other than that, nothing much related to Education/SA/Higher Ed specifically. "

Advice for pursuing a career in academic advising please!,"Hello everyone, I am a first year undergrad student interested in becoming an academic advisor in higher education. I would greatly appreciate any advice/answers provided! :)

I have been doing some research on the path to this career with the general understanding that I must earn a masters in higher education administration + student affairs and also acquire relevant experience. 

Here are some of the questions I am struggling to find answers to:

* What is a preferable major to earn in undergrad? Would a major such as sociology be suitable/desired as a supplement to the masters degree? Does your undergrad major matter at all?

* What exactly should I do after earning my undergraduate degree? Do I apply for a smaller position at a university and work for a year or two before pursuing a graduate degree or go straight from undergrad to grad school? 

* How long can one expect to wait before finding a job as an academic advisor after earning a masters degree? 

* How is the transition from relevant experience to a first full on academic advising position? How does the training/prep for all the job duties work in this field?"
Is anyone here a Financial Aid Counselor? Or know much about the position?,"Currently trying to break into the field after graduating with my master's in counseling and student personnel psych degree this past spring.

I recently had an in-person interview for an advising job but haven't heard back, so I'm guessing I didn't get it. However, a Financial Aid Counselor job just opened up at my undergraduate school so I'm considering applying for that. I'm just worried that job wouldn't lead to other jobs in student affairs, but that might just be because I have a lack of knowledge about that area of student affairs. Thanks!"
College-level instruction while working in higher education?,"Hey, I was hoping reddit would be a suitable area to ask this. 

I am an undergraduate student with an intention to go into the higher education field. That being said, I have long enjoyed the concept of teaching at the university level, and am curious as to whether or not working as a higher education professional can provide me with this? I have noticed some of my supervisors have been able to teach basic leadership courses. Simply put, I want to be able to teach on a part-time basis, is this possible/recommended? If anyone has experience or knows anyone who has taught on the side, what was the experience like?

Thank you for anyone who is able to answer this. I very much appreciate it."
Need to Make a Decision - Student Affairs or Not,"So, I am at a crucial precipice and I want to make the right choice; so, I'm enlisting you all for opinions. I really want to be an academic advisor; but, from my research of the industry, in order to get the kind of job I am looking for, I will need a master's degree.

I'm trying to be overly cautious because I have too many mistakes in education and the working world weighing me down and I can't afford to make another one.

Thanks to my parent's assistance in allowing me to live with them rent free, I have the ability to take any two classes as a non-degree student at an undisclosed university in Virginia. 

I also have the ability to take any classes within the Academic Advising Grad. Certificate program at Kansas State. 

My plan as it stands is to take two in-person classes at the state school that are part of the M.S.in Higher Education (Student Affairs) program and to take one distance-learning class that is part of the Academic Advising Grad. Cert. program at K-State.

Cost wise, I'm looking at $2,877.00  for the two Virginia state school classes and $1,654.80 for the one K-State class... for a grand total of: $4,531.80.

In taking these classes, for the state school, I will have completed two classes that are part of the Student Affairs Administration track of the Higher Education master's degree... I will still have 33 credits (11 classes) to go to complete the degree... which, if tuition stays the same (it won't), will cost at least another $15,823.50.

For K-State, to complete the Grad. Cert. in Academic Advising, I am looking at at least four more classes, for a total of $6,619.20 (again, assuming tuition doesn't go up).

So, all in all, in order to pretty much guarantee that I can get an entry level academic advising job somewhere in the country, I'm looking to add another $22,442.70 onto what already amounts to over $150,000 of school debts (all of which I am currently unable to pay down on given my present salary and obligations--again, I have made many mistakes in higher ed up to this point...).

My question is, do you think taking on this new debt for this purpose is worth it? 

The biggest problems I am struggling with are the return on investment and the higher education job market. 

According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, the median salary in the U.S. for an academic adviser is $43,546. For an event-planning assistant (pretty much what I am right now) the median salary in the U.S. is $36,356.

Consider this, however: I make exactly $28,652, which is only 78% of the national median. If, keeping things consistent, I made 78% of the national median for an academic advisor, I'd be looking at about $34,318 per year. So, for an ""investment"" of $22,442.70 one can say conservatively that I will only increase my salary by less than $6,000 a year (or $250 per pay check). 

Over a 10 year period I'd be looking at about $60,000 more in income; but, my monthly bill to finance that loan would be half of the increase in my salary--so, really it'd only be about $30,000 over a 10 year period (or about $250 extra dollars per month). 

All of this might be acceptable if I could guarantee job security and didn't have worries about the bottom falling out of the higher education market... my guess is we're in a bubble right now with Higher Ed. Admin. and there's nothing for it to do but burst. 

Is this a fair guess?

I just don't know how to predict what life would look like in a world where the niche that I am trying to specialize in goes away... What are your thoughts on this?

(One problem to consider is how versatile a Higher Ed. Admin. degree is (or, is not, in this case)--if I were studying, say, counseling, or something more general, I think I'd be less worried--note that counseling is off the table for me seeing as though a M.S. in Counseling is 61 credits at the state school I'm at).

Another issue I have is that I know the Higher Ed. Admin. courses are going to be easy for me. On the one hand that's a good thing because it means I'll be able to basically BS my way through a master's degree--hopefully maybe even to the point that I am a stand out student and achieve some recognition from the school and the program. But, and this is my greatest concern, I think that if the classes are a joke, it's a huge signal that the actual value of the degree is border-line worthless (except for allowing one to continue in the Higher Ed. world (bubble?) since it's pretty much a requirement to have that credential to obtain a full time job--at least in tough markets like Virginia--maybe not in places like Texas, however). 

What I mean is, I will not really be increasing my skills all that much with a degree in Higher Ed. That concerns me both because I know I can do more and because I know being able to do more is more valuable over time. 

But, what does it mean to do ""more""?

Given the trajectory of where our economy is heading (my guess is we're going to need to begin becoming more competitive in manufacturing if we're to ever increase the size of the middle class), I just wonder if it might be better for me to say no to this opportunity right now and work toward something more technical and more difficult--even if it's outside of my present field. 

So, yes, here is the crux of my struggle.

I have had success at studying more technical material than what one finds in student affairs. In particular, I know that if I were to apply myself, I could leverage my ability to work with computers (programming, working with data analysis tools, database management, mathematics, stats., etc.), and ultimately get a job with a starting salary much higher than anything in education. 

So, I guess I wonder if I might be better off diverting any money available for education into a program that builds the kind of skillset marketable enough to earn significantly more than I will as an academic advisor. Say, by studying computer science, engineering, statistics, etc. etc. . . . the chief concern not just being the mental satisfaction of being challenged but the economic incentive of being able to actually pay my bills.

Perhaps instead of signing up for two classes leading into Higher Ed. I could do one Higher Ed. class and one difficult class and prove that what I say is true--that, if I apply myself, I *can* succeed in something more technical. Perhaps that's a gamble worth taking just to ensure that I am not selling myself short...?

What do you guys think?

There's a lot more to all of this--like the fact that I do have 10 months of the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill available... the fact that I currently work in Higher Ed. and have more experience in Higher Ed. than any other industry (except for defense, which I don't wish to get back into), and other things like working conditions... flexibility... personalities with whom I work... etc. etc. All of which might be better in Higher Ed. than elsewhere."
Analytics and Institutional Research,"I wanted to ask if anyone in this community is using predictive analytics (sometimes referred to as 'big data' or 'data science/machine learning') in their day to day or strategic planning.

Can anyone speak to these:

* What sort of data you collect, or would like to collect
* How this data is/would be collected, or stored

Student Activities Questions,"Hey everyone, 

I have a few questions and hope this is a good place to get soem responses.  If there is a better subreddit please point me in that direction.

1.
I work at a small private institution as the Director of Student Activities.  Recently I have noticed an increase in overall apathy from the student body.  With a limited budget I try to bring in events that they couldn't otherwise do in our location and support the common interests most students have ( we are on the beach so I bring in rock walls, zip lines, etc but also cater to surf culture with beach parties, luaus, and free water sport equipment rentals)

Surprisingly attendance is highest at dances in our dinning hall and bingo nights.  I was wondering if anyone had had extremely successful events that were unique to your institution and had students wanting to see it again year after year?

2.
I see a lot of posts on here from Check Im Here, does anyone use that system?  What do you utilize on it the most?  Are there other systems like orgsync or campus labs that you would recommend for tracking attendance, surveying, and promoting events?

3.
Our Service Learning opportunities have been less utilized this semester compared to the past three years.  I am trying to find a balance between addressing social issues in our community and the ""sexy"" appeal that draws students in.  Any suggestions on service opportunities that work well at your institution or tips on revitalizing the marketing of these opportunities?

Thanks for reading through my random thoughts/frustrations about the current semester and for any words of wisdom you all could share.

Should colleges (SA Pro Staff) monitor YikYak?,"I was reading an article inside higher ed and they were talking about a demand to monitor YikYak.

Buy or rent textbooks for SA grad program?,"I am starting a grad program for student affairs and need to order my books.  I'm on the fence between buying or renting textbooks because I've kept almost none from undergrad, but student affairs texts may be useful in a future job.  Is it worth it to purchase books?"
What kinds of SA jobs are there and what is the right fit for me?,"Hello everyone,

I'm thinking about pursuing a career in student affairs, but am a bit overwhelmed by the wide variety of job options available. I'd really like to work face-to-face with students on a regular basis and am considering academic advising or financial aid counseling. Are there other types of jobs in student affairs where I could work closely with students?

Thank you!"
Career options for someone with RA/Res Life experience?,"Graduated college this year and was looking to break into Residence Life as a profession. 10-12 interviews later and have not been extended any offers.

How much communication is there between college administrations?,"Basically, what I want to figure out is whether as a student affairs professional at one school, you know a lot of student affairs professionals at other schools."
How much does going to a top grad school matter for a Student Affairs career?,"Hello All! 

I am currently working in marketing/communications in an admissions office for a mid-sized public university. I would like to transition to a more student-involved role over time. At the school I work for, I get a great education benefit. I could essentially get a Masters in Higher Ed Admin for a 90% discount. The one thing is, the degree program is fairly young and hasn't built much of a reputation for itself thus far. (It seems like a decent program, it's just that the Ed department is not a household name by any means.) 

My question is: if I am trying to kick-off a dynamic career in SA, will the reputation of the institution in which I earned my MA matter significantly? Are potential SA employers very prestige-conscious like they are in fields such as law/business? "
The question to end all questions: NASPA or ACPA or ACUHO-I?,"Question: Which professional organization should I join/get involved with?

Background: I'm a new-professional looking to build knowledge and get involved.

I am a former ACPA member (I let it run out) and was involved with SEAHO (but no longer in that region).  I am also job-searching.

Goals: I want to continue to working in Housing/ResLife with a focus on Living-Learing Programs.  In the foreseeable future I'd like to begin my Ph.D. program focusing on the History of Higher Ed and Policy and Law.

I'm just looking for some guidance(s) in the area so any thought, personal experiences, and input are greatly appreciated, as are any debates on the merit or orgs.  "
New member looking to return to Student Affairs after three year break. Looking for a mentor.,"First off, hello everyone!

I was recently seeking resume help and advice when a kind poster pointed me in the direction of this subreddit!  I'm glad to see Student Affairs has such a strong showing here!

As for me, I'm hoping to return to the Student Affairs field after taking a three-year break to work in the private sector.  As much as I'm sure I needed a break after living and working on campus for the better part of 10 years, I find myself missing interacting with students.

I have tried unsuccessfully to re-enter the field but I'm not giving up yet!

I'm looking to connect with people in the field and even find mentors that can help me improve myself, my skill-set, and my ability to serve students.

Thank you so much for reading!"

Retention Information,"Hi Folks,

I'm doing a project for work in which I'm tracking our freshman retention over the last five years and comparing it to other schools.

Career Fair Prep,"Do any of you do any work with your Career Management Center to get your students ready for a Career Fair? My office has recently started programming for student prior to the Career Fair to help them get ready, particularly when it come to clothes and looking good. Currently, we do the following things: 

1. Clothes Closet - We look for donations from the University Community of gently used professional clothing that we then will give to students for when they walk around the Fair. We will ask for some things back, but will also let the students keep the outfits if it's all they have access to. We will also go shopping at Goodwill if donations aren't enough.
2. Career Fair Fashion Show - We host a fashion (complete with music and a runway) in a busy area of campus during the student common lunch hour to show students what they should (and shouldn't) wear to a Career Fair.
3. Sponsored buses to Men's Warehouse and Anne Taylor (because they both give our student's a discount on clothes)
4. Table tents in student dining areas
5. Advertisements in the school's newspaper and daily electronic newsletter, as well as Social Media postings

Are your offices doing anything else that you think has been helpful to your students when it comes to helping them navigate career fairs? Our Career Management Officer takes charge of the programming that focuses on interview basics."

Virtual Programming?,"Hi all, my department typically runs a whole lot of student programming and events. We've recently gone online for the rest of the semester and can't do any in-person events or gatherings.

For example, has anyone tried games on [Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/) or streaming content and chatting on [Metastream](https://getmetastream.com/)? 

The student group my department typically focuses on is a minority group that tends to engage well in our events, so I'm hopeful we'll be able to think of SOMETHING fun to do through the end of the semester.

Need help finding a (quantitative) research topic/datasets,"I am in a public administration graduate program, not a student affairs program, however I work as an administrative assistant at the university and want to move into student/academic affairs.

I’m taking a quantitative research/statistics class and have to write a quantitative research paper on a topic of my choosing. I have to collect the data, test hypotheses, analyze it and draw conclusions, and it must include multiple regression. 

So I know there must be plenty of topics in higher ed administration and student affairs that involve quantitative methods, but I’m having trouble getting started because I’m directly working with students and taking student affairs classes. Additionally, we are allowed to use publicly available data sets because the course is about analyzing the data, not collecting it, however I’m not sure if there are available data sets like this for higher ed.

Does anyone have any resources, journals, datasets or literature that could help me get started? I know how to actually analyze the data once I have it but for some reason I’m really struggling on finding a topic that is doable within the scope of this class, ideally using public data or possibly institutional data at my school."

Advice on masters programs? (Specifically UCONN),"So I'm a junior currently at U of MN and I've suddenly realized I want to go into student affairs this semester. 

I have a History and Native American Indigenous Studies double major and a Deaf Studies minor and will be graduating with honors unless something goes terribly wrong in the next three semesters. 

I currently work for TRiO as a peer mentor where I create programing for first year students who are low income, first gen, minority background, or disabled. I really love my work and want to do something similar for my career. 

I know I for sure want to attend a grad program in New England for family reasons and have been looking into University of Connecticut's program. I was wondering if anyone had any reviews or opinions on programs in the area. I was originally considering HGSE at Harvard but I realized the program wasn't the right match for me."
Transitioning from Small School to Fairly Large,"I oversee Campus Activities. As a grad student, I worked at a small private school of around 4,000 people. Now, for the past year, I've worked at a state junior college with even less people, and only about 300 residential students. The place I'm at is not a good fit for me, in terms of both culture and setting. I'm looking to leave and want to apply to some larger schools (around 18,000 students).   
Despite my best effort and a lot of after-hours time spent working on programs and events (cleanup, setup, etc), most events just don't go well. I know in my brain a lot of that is because of our dwindling financial resources and because I'm literally a one-man show, and also the student culture (very few students want to even attend events, much less put forth any effort into providing programs). But I can't help chalking it up to some extent as a failure on my part. And the thought of leaping into a much larger pool terrifies me, as if I can't succeed at a small institution, I feel like I'll drown and just disappoint students at a larger school where there's so many more people to account for and keep up with.   
So I guess my question is, to those who have made similar transitions, how have you dealt with any fear related to it? Small schools are all I've known, and I'm terrified I'll be thrown into another one-man show situation at a bigger institution."

Leaving a Job You Love,"I work with a Campus Activities Board. I absolutely love what I do. I truly enjoy working with students, especially in an event planning capacity.

I have been in my position for three years. While I love what I do, I unfortunately am not in a supportive environment. Everyone is in their silos. There are small cliques. We see a ton of turnover. It has a lot upper management micromanaging and stifling creativity. 

As I shared, there has been a lot of turnover. Many of my close colleagues have moved on to other opportunities. I have decided to start searching for my next position. The challenge is... I am having a hard time with the thought of parting ways with a job I love and an amazing group of students.

Is it Right For Me?,"Hello! I've been subbed for a bit now, but finally decided to post. I'm a rising Undergrad Senior and I'm considering going into Student Affairs/Higher Education Admin after graduating. I'm super active on campus with Student Government, my campus' activity board, abd study abroad. I'm fairly active with NACA as an undergrad intern and NASPA as a NUFP mentee. I'll be doing an internship at a university's Dean of Student's office over the summer, as well as attending DLI. I do really think that I would succeed in Higher Ed. 

However, some of the SA pros at my undergrad institution disagree. I have been strongly discouraged from going into the SA field by some of my advisors. One told me that I should look into a less-people focused career as I don't have the skillset for SA, and another said autistic people like myself don't suceed in higher ed. 

This has greatly shaken my confidence. While this is something that I have a passion for, I can help but take into account what they have to say. It's tough to be knocked down when I speak to them. I'm considering backing out of the internship, changing course, and taking a less people focused job, per my advisors recommendation. I'm just unsure of where to go, so i'm turning to you reddit. Should I be putting weight to these recommendations and abandon SA or should I keep plugging along with my passion for it?"
Can I count my experience as related work experience?,"Hello r/studentaffairs community,
I am looking to break into the student affairs field, but I am hoping for some advice/guidance from some knowledgeable folks. I am applying for anything and everything at the colleges and universities in my area with the goal of working in academic advising, ideally.

I graduated with a BS in sociology with a minor in organizational leadership in summer 2017. Following my graduation, I worked unsuccessfully in several unrelated jobs for about 2 months each, and found that none of them fit me. 

A year ago I took a job working in hospitality so that I could move to the area where I wanted to live. If I'm being completely honest, I had no idea what I wanted to do in my career, and after working successfully in a field that does not fulfill me, I've realized student affairs is for me.

During my undergraduate career I was involved in orientation, Greek life, student conduct board, and leadership in several other capacities. I worked as a student assistant in the President's office and completed two internships. This is a very simplified summary of my involvement and undergraduate experience. 

Now for the actual questions:
1. Does my undergraduate experience count as the ""one or more years of related work experience"" that most of the jobs I've found require?
2. How can I frame my experience, relevant and irrelevant, as a selling point in applications and interviews?
3. Should I be applying for the academic advising/registrar jobs that I'm hoping for or start smaller?

I appreciate this community and thank you all for any advice you may give. "
I have an interview! What should I expect?,"I have an interview next week to be a PT Advisor in a college's TRiO department. I have been trying to land this position for a long time, so I want to be 100% prepared. What kind of questions should I expect at this interview? 

Just some background-- I am coming from K-12 Education. I applied to be an Academic Advisor at several colleges while I was in my last semester of undergrad. Since I had no luck, I decided I would give high school teaching a try while I worked towards getting hired by a college eventually. While working in the high schools, I knew pretty quickly that it wasn't the right field for me (but did not have any luck getting interviews at colleges, so I stayed in high schools). I worked at 3 schools in 3 1/2 years, and the reason for my movement is because I was trying to find a good fit in a field that was a bad fit. Just in case this movement is addressed during the interview, I would really like to tell them the honest truth-- that I've always wanted to work in Higher Education and that my being unhappy in my previous field is what caused me to not to stay in one place. In your opinion, do you think this honesty would hurt my chances?

Career Center Pros: To Survey or Not to Survey?,"Flirting with the idea of a 2-3 question email student survey after each visit with the Career Resource Center. I value transparency and truth, already ask my students when I'm walking them out whether or not they felt the meeting was worthwhile.

Please advise: Student Observation and Concern,"Hi - I have a student that I advise/supervise in a student organization. I'm one of few people on campus in a professional setting that they interact within an advisor/mentor type relationship. Throughout the course of the school year, I've seen the student exhibit unhealthy food choices and moodiness. Recently, while traveling,  I noticed that the student started the car ride in a great mood. The five us shared in road trip karaoke and storytelling to entertain us during our travels. Along the way, the student asked to go to Wendy's, while the other students including myself went to a more healthier option. Not long after purchasing their food the student got into the car and was irritable and even looked different. They were the only person at their chosen restaurant. I've seen this happen prior to our meetings before, but have never been able to connect the dots between cause and effect. The student has spent some of our meeting times being sick in the restroom because of stomach trouble after eating fast food.  However, I have a hypothesis that the food choices she is making are negatively affecting her mood not too long after it is consumed. I also have observed that in due time they return to a less irritable state.  As a mentor and caring professional- should I approach this topic? I care about their health, but I also know that the student is in their second year, 19, without many people having the luxury of consistent and close observation.

&#x200B;

For additional context: this is my second year knowing the student and I spend about 3-4 hours a week with the student for various meetings.  Sorry if this sounds like a grad school case study.

Edit: I do not enjoy posting on Reddit to begin with.  I'm not trying to change their eating habits. I honestly could care less what people eat, but I remember a time when I was crashing after meals and didn't' recognize an insulin problem that could have helped me drastically in my educational career. I don't micromanage student's behaviors. I have too much to do as it is. I posted this to know if it was worth saying something or not specifically to the student. I already have a hard time of working with little resources as it is and really could avoid the additional sass.  Thanks in advance for any insight. "
Does working in Student Services at a college increase your odds of being hired as a professor at that college in the future?,"Long story short-- I am a graduate student whose ultimate goal is to be a college professor. I am working towards landing a part-time academic advising position at a community college. I think this would be a great opportunity for me to get my foot in the door of Higher Education (and it also seems like a position I would really enjoy).

Does anyone know if this type of experience would help me get an adjunct (and then hopefully full-time) position in the future? I have three years of high school teaching experience as well. I just know Higher Ed experience is probably more valuable in this case.

Thanks!

MBA worth it in Higher Education? (Administration),"Hello,

I graduated with an undergrad degree in Business Management, worked for a major retailer as an operations manager for just over a year and then transitioned back to my Alma Mater as an Assistant Director of Operations for the Admissions department.

I am really loving my new position and could see myself working in Higher Education Administration for a long time. One of the benefits for working for the university is having access to a 70% tuition deferral, so I could essentially pursue a graduate degree for a fraction of what I spent on my undergrad degree.

My first thought is to go for an MBA as my undergrad degree already completes the first group of core classes, either in Business Analytics or Operations/Logistics, but I've heard that an MBA is only worth it from a top-school, which isn't a real possibility right now. Have you or anyone you've known seen an MBA be useful while working through the ladder in Higher Education? Are there other graduate programs that would be more beneficial for this field?

Rescinded job offer regrets,"Hi all,

In August, I ended up rescinding a job offer which I now think I should have accepted. Some background knowledge: I'm a relatively new professional and have been at my current institution for a year and a half. Our institution went through some restructuring, causing a lot of us to look at other positions (four of my coworkers left). I interviewed for a great job back in my hometown that would have afforded me more money, being near my family, and an opportunity to work at a larger institution. I struggled for weeks to decide whether or not I wanted to accept the offer, and after I did, I felt regretful because I'd grown attached to the people at my current job/friends I'd made here. I ended up rescinding the offer in favor of my personal development. Now, however, I feel a bit stunted and feel like I made a mistake professionally/personally. 

My question is, while I know they've filled the position I rescinded and it would be silly to come groveling back, I don't want to be blacklisted from that institution/department. I worked for them in grad school and had built a strong relationship with them, but now I fear I ruined that relationship by accepting then rescinding the offer. 

Is it too late to reach out to them to apologize and explain my mindset to them? How can I work on repairing that relationship in order to potentially have the opportunity to work there in the future? I understand that I have to stay the course at my current job because that's the choice I made, and I'll put my heart and soul into that. But have any of you ever worked at an institution to which you originally said no? 

Thank you in advance! "
Question from an interview and my gender.,"Hi everyone!

Question for the group:

I had a great pre-phone interview a few days ago for an FSL opportunity.  The hiring manager asked a question that was a concern from the students that I would be potentially working with and I would like to run it by you all for advice/help/views.  The female students are wanted to have a female in the position after the previous three professionals were male.  The hiring manager asked how I would address this need from the women in the community.  I responded by affirming the need for representation in a professional setting, as a male identifying individual am enthusiastic about their organizations and the awesome work they are doing and how they are leading the fraternal community.  That communicating my passion and ability to serve their organizations would be crucial and it would start with establishing a strong relationship with the leaders of each organization and the leadership of the community.  

Would you all have any thoughts, ideas, concerns about my answer or better ways to address this situation?"
Bystander Intervention," Hello everyone. 

At the school where I work at we are looking to implement a violence and discrimination prevention program, so far the idea of having a bystanser intervention program has been the most popular.  On the coming days we are set to have a meeting with ""SAGE Academy"" about their bystander intervention training, I'm reading a paper they published about their bystander intervention program and I'm not sure if it is the right one for us. I don't know any other company that does this kind of training and so i wanna ask you a couple of things, first, has any of you had any experience with this bystander training by SAGE Academy?

Another intern said that she's paying someone to write her thesis.,"I'm at my ACUHO-i internship for a summer practicum. One of the other interns here told me, along with a few other interns, that she is paying someone to write her thesis for her. I don't have any solid proof, and we think she's lying, but it really rubbed us the wrong way. Do you recommend that we email the department head at her institution to let them know?

I asked some of my colleagues who are higher up in the SA world, and a few said that they don't want me to burn bridges, especially if it comes back that we reported it. But knowing this girl, she won't last very long in the SA world and our paths might never cross. They are worried that I'll be blacklisted from whatever institution she worked at, but as stated before, she's not meant for this field and is burning bridges here at this institution she is currently working at."
Wrong date to file for request,"Hello people of this sub,

I wanted to ask if anybody has experience with near academic dropout.

I try to make this comprehensible and short as possible

I am almost at the end of my studies (bachelor thesis already graded, practical workload of internships etc. finished, all exams but 3 done)

Due to my depression I had to put my studies on slow, and until now I have worked off this mountain of exams; until my remaining 3 plus 1 more (results pending but it went well) 

We have a credit system which requires you to pass exams worth 30 credits each semester, to stay immatriculated. I had only left 3 exams for this semester (wintersemester) of each 9 credits and 4 courses in the summer semester with the remaining credits before i finish.

I did well on my last exams and even pulled up another course from the summer, so i could maybe get over the 30, but i dont know how i did on that one.

I have medical documentation that i can submit together with a written statement why i would like to continue studying, despite not hitting the 30, but I wrote down the wrong date for the submission; the professors of my field have convient 2 days ago.

I will still file my papers, with an additional note, that I made the mistake with the date, but I know they can reject me.

Has anybody got experience with a case like this? 

I am ok if I will be expelled. It would just suck, because I worked my way out of depression and now this.

Edit: typos"
HELP! I took the wrong job!,"This may seem like the epitome of first\-world problems, but I took a job \(mid\-level\) at a large, private institution about 6 months ago and I am really struggling to adjust. It's not so much my core job function, I feel very comfortable with my tasks, but I'm really struggling to find my place, both at the institution and in my office.  Here are the key pieces:

1\) Part of why I struggle is that my institution has a very unique structure, one that I don't feel I fully gathered, either from the interview or my own research, and navigating that has cause me to have to very real questions about my value and place.  Essentially, I feel my position is not designed to be successful. I am not the only one who feels this way, but I don't think other have a real frame of reference.

2\) My office culture is strained to say the least. My supervisor had a very disjointed method of on\-boarding me, and it occurred because if preexisting rifts in our office. I've tried to come in and take initiative to overcome this, but because of my previous point, this is very difficult.

3\) I am an introvert, but my function is one where this is common. I've worked very hard to get to a good place to be successful in my role, but the above mentioned struggles have been super taxing. This to the point where I've been having panic attacks \(which I haven't had in roughly 10 years\).  I've sought counseling through a confidential service my institution provides. 

4\) My commute sucks. I could move, but not enough to make a substantial difference. 

So I'm looking for advice. How to I plot a way out?  I'm in a position where I've saved some funds, and could leave without a new job, but at the opposite end part of me says to suck it up.  I need some fresh opinions. Thanks!"
Job search with no SA experience,"Hello all.

I'm graduating in may with an interdisciplinary MS in Counseling (3/4) and student affairs (1/4). I have the ultimate goal of Dean of Students at a mid-to-large university. The only pathways I've heard for DoS would be through ResLife, Student activities, Multicultural affairs, or conduct. I'm fine with, and am interested in, all of these FAs, but I have ZERO direct experience in all of these (except for conduct, where I've had a practicum this semester with limited hands on experience).

How am I going to break into the field? What sort of jobs should I be looking for? I hate the idea that I will have to work as an admin assistant for a year or longer just to get the experience I supposedly need to get a job that would make use of (and pay appropriately for) my MS.

Anyway, thanks for any and all advice."
Is a master's worth it without full funding?,"I would prefer to go to a school where my master's would be fully funded, but so far in my search, I've only found one (UConn HESA). The other programs I've looked at have potential, but either they offer no tuition support or provide ""modest"" support. I've also seen schools that offer a nine-credit tuition waiver with an assistantship, but I'm not sure that will be enough for me. I looked at Michigan State, as they offer a nine-credit tuition waiver, when most grad students take 10 credits a semester. That's the next best I got.

I get the idea that you shouldn't end up in debt for this degree, and I hesitate to go into a program knowing I may still have to take out loans. Am I on the right track by only looking at fully funded programs? I am willing to relocate, but it feels like I would just end up forking out a ton of money for a master's in an overcrowded field with mixed career potential. "
Good questions to ask for second round interview?,"I'm doing ACUHOI this summer and I was offered second round interviews for two schools. I've asked questions like ""what does your summer look like on campus in terms of housing and conferences?"" and ""what's your favorite part about your institution?"" and ""what have other interns said about this position?""

What other questions can I ask? I'm thinking about asking campus culture, maybe supervisory style. They're also private, research institutions if that helps. My mind is blank :("
Don't know how to choose a program,"Hi everyone! I've found a ton of helpful information on this subreddit about what to consider when applying for a graduate program, so thank you! I have definite answers as to what kind of program I want, but I'm not always sure that's matching up with the schools I'm looking at. I would love some feedback or suggestions on what to add/remove from the list! Oh, and my ultimate goal is to work in a Career Center :)

About me:
-3.83 GPA
-Above average GRE scores
-2 years experience as an RA, 3 years volunteering in Career Center

Wants:
-For my grad school to be paid for by an assistantship, probably in Res Life (lol like every other grad student)
-East or West coast preferably
-Larger school
-Counseling focus, not administrative 

My current list of schools:
-Syracuse
-Cal State Sacramento
-Colorado State University
-SUNY Plattsburg
-Florida State University
-Mississippi State University
-Cal State Northridge (maybe)
-Virginia Commonwealth U (maybe... no idea how much their assistantship covers)

I'm considering a masters in CSP. Is it a good move?,I'm a current high school teacher looking at doing a masters degree in CSP. My question is is it even worth getting? Are the jobs similar in pay?

Questions regarding necessary qualifications for an International Student Advising position,"First, I would like to say thank you simply for this community! I have been browsing recently, and the amount of support this subreddit offers is amazing (I suppose it's only natural- being comprised of academic advisers, and all)!

I graduated from Humboldt State University with a Business Management degree, but my final year there I became heavily involved with the International community on campus, along with the International department at HSU. 

Helping create a welcoming and supportive community for the students studying abroad, especially in a more isolated area compared to what most students anticipated when traveling to California, was extremely rewarding. It felt like I found my calling. Though, aside from the year of volunteering with the university, I'm not confident on how to proceed in pursuing a career in the field.

What are good ways to get a foot in the door and garner advising experience? Is a higher degree necessary? Are there free/affordable certification programs available?

Thank you for your time!"
Want to get into New Student and Family Programs and Orientations.. where do I begin?,"I really want to acquire my masters in Higher Education. I'm currently going into my senior year at the University of Florida and have had a pretty involvement-heavy run (Greek life, tour office, SG, community service within the university, etc), which has made me realize that my passions lie with first generation students and wanting to work with incoming freshmen. I'm acquiring a B.S in Psychology and B.S in Family, Youth, and Community Sciences, minoring in Educational Studies. If I know this is my end goal, which graduate schools should I look into that would help suit those needs? Is the job market for this position very competitive as well? "
How competitive are assistantships?,"How hard is it to get into a higher education master's program and get an assistantship? I'll be applying to schools with a year of tutoring college students under my belt, but that's about it. Is it likely that I could get an assistantship with not much experience or do people generally have to be more involved in that type of stuff as an undergrad to be competitive?"
I am working on a competition to get students to create their alma mater song. Anyone out there with experience?,"The school I am at right now is fairly new, and they are still creating a lot of their traditions. One thing they need is an alma mater song.

I am just wondering how some of you have gotten students to engage in this."
I'm experiencing a lot of harassment on my campus lately from political canvassers looking for donations,"I'm getting really frustrated with this and don't know if there's even anything I can do, or who on campus I would contact about this. Lately it seems like I can barely walk from one class to another without a canvasser interrupting me and demanding my time. 

It always ends the same way if you listen to their spiel; they want money for Greenpeace, ACLU, or whatever organization they're with. Today one of the canvassers almost pushed me to my breaking point by making a rude comment when I politely said I didn't have time and tried to walk past them, meant to make me feel guilty for not giving them a donation. I basically depleted my life savings to go back to school and am so broke, I can barely afford to buy food and pay my utilities right now. I was so ashamed, I went to the library and cried and have been in a bad mood all day. 

Some of these people are so aggressive and disrespectful and I'm sick of having to either put up with this or waste valuable study time by taking long routes around campus to avoid them. What can I do to get them to back off? "
International Scholarships,"Good day.

I'm looking for any advice on this topic.
I'm a South African, currently living in Cambodia (teaching English).  I have a Bcom Human Resource Management degree that is internationally recognized.  I have been accepted to do my Masters in South Africa - which is an option for me.  BUT I would love to study abroad.  I have done some research on Taiwan and China(my sister and friends of mine are studying there) but I am open to any other country across the world - preferably a first world country.  

Another factor is that I'm in Cambodia with my girlfriend (she is also from South Africa and also teaching English).  She does not have a degree but is interested in obtaining one - she qualified for a Bsc degree in SA but the country is unstable and there are protests and Universities are a hazard - it's hectic!

We are both Bilingual (English and Afrikaans).  We easily adapt to new surroundings and we are looking to start/continue our studies early 2018.  We are looking for a scholarship and would love to be at the same university or the same area.

Suggestions are welcome.

Thank you,

How do other schools view online classes?,"Hi everyone. Sorry if my question is stupid but I was wondering how do other colleges view online classes? I currently go to a community college and have taken 4-5 online classes instead of the traditional classes, in part because online classes fit my schedule better and I can do all my work from home. Once I transfer to a 4 year college, do you think the fact that I have taken so many online classes will have any impact on my acceptance? Do other colleges look down on online classes? Or are online classes held to the same standard as traditional classes? I feel like online classes are considered easier... Anyway thanks for answering!!"

Graduating my HESA program early & the job market,"Hi all. I'm trying to decide whether to graduate early from my Higher Education/Student Affairs masters program. I have 3 classes left and work full-time in the field. I could either cram all 3 classes into the fall semester and graduate early, or I could save one class for the spring semester and graduate in May. I'm wondering if it could be advantageous in the job market to graduate off-cycle (in December, when there are theoretically fewer new grads looking for work). 

I am currently working in the subfield of student affairs that I want to stay in, but I want to move to another institution. I'm in a pretty competitive region and an area of the field that it seems like lots of people want to work in. The last time my department had an open position, we had over 200 applicants and only interviewed 4 of them. So, basically I'm worried about my chances of even getting an interview if I look for another position.

Am I wrong in thinking I might have a better chance in the job market if I graduate early? Enough so to make it worth going through a brutal semester? Compared to what my colleagues say about the HESA programs they graduated from, mine seems a lot more rigorous, but I think I could handle the extra-heavy workload for one semester. I would really appreciate any opinions. Thanks!"

Heavy sleeper who is on call and needs help!,Hi everyone! Does anyone have tips on how to wake up to a phone call if you are a heavy sleeper? Or how to become a light sleeper?

Looking to get back into the field...,"Hey everyone! Hopefully I can get some opinions or some advice from here! 

I was involved in residence life during undergrad, I was first an RA, then an apartment RA, and finally an Assistance Residence Hall Director. I was really considering going to the Oshkosh Placement Exchange my senior year, but due to some events involving my personal life, it wasn't the right time to go. 

Now, I've been out of undergrad for a little more than year, and I work in Law Enforcement (a Jail to be precise, so now I am basically an RA in a res hall with residents who are a little different). I enjoy my job, but I still have the draw to student affairs and I think that long term, getting back to working for Universities would be best for me. 

With all that being said, I am seriously considering going to OPE in 2017 and putting my name in the fight. My question is, would I still be competitive or viable? I've been out of the student affairs world for a year (will be about 2 by OPE) will that negatively or positively work for me if/when I go to OPE?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Proposal for strategies to increase Retention/Graduation Assignment. Need help and input!,"I am currently working on an assignment that answers a Call for Proposals on programs/initiatives to increase student retention from first year to second year students. There is also a proposal for increased graduation rates, but these programs must specifically focus on sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

Which grad school option is better?,"Below are the details of my dilemma over whether to continue in an expensive but well-regarded HESA program or switch to a less well known program which would be free after 6 months at my new job. I'd appreciate any feedback. Thanks!

I am currently in the first semester of a two-year masters program in Higher Education and Student Affairs at school A. I have a paid graduate assistant position with tuition remission at school A. However, I just accepted a job offer for a full-time position at another college, school B. This position will start next semester. School B also has a HESA masters program and they offer full tuition remission after 6 months of employment. I believe I'd be able to transfer my credits from school A to school B, but need to verify that. School A seems to have a better program in terms of resources, research opportunities, range of courses available, and networking.

School A is a large private research university. It is definitely more well-known, more highly ranked, and much more ""prestigious"" than school B. School A is much more convenient to my house (15 min. commute vs. 1 hour commute), and I would be happy to work there at a later point in my career. School B is a smaller, private comprehensive university and my impression is that it is not well-known outside this region. Now that I won't be a graduate assistant at school A anymore, I would have to pay full tuition if I continue in the program at school A.

My question is whether I should continue with my masters at school A now that I'll have to pay the full (expensive) tuition. How much does prestige matter in our field? 

I should mention that thanks to my partner's generous salary it would not be a financial hardship to pay for 1 class per semester at school A, but of course I don't want to unnecessarily spend the money if continuing to attend school A won't make much of a difference in my future career opportunities. 

Thanks for any input!

Edited to add another detail: A couple HESA students I spoke to at school B said the program is quite disorganized and overall they did not seem very pleased with it. The program is a lot smaller than school A's program, FWIW."

Concerned about financial compensation in the Student Affairs Profession,"Hello SA professionals! 

I am currently on my grad school search trying to find the right program for myself. I'm currently taking an Intro to Student Affairs course at my university and I'm very interested in the field.

What worries me is the pay. Now, I understand that it's more important to find work that I love than to find a job that pays well, but coming from an engineering undergrad I have had this expectation that I will make decent money right out of college. 

Another factor that plays into this is that my parents have never known financial stability (I'm first gen and of a lower socioeconomic background). I am also going to be ~23k in debt after undergrad. 

Do you all feel financially stable? How did you handle loans? How likely that I would be able to move up the salary ladder within ~5 years time?

Academic advising position interview - strategies and advice. (repost from /r/AskAcademia),"I will be interviewing for an academic undergraduate advising position at a major public higher ed institution that also happens to be my alma mater. I hold a humanities PhD, have taught for well over five years, both as a TA and faculty, and thus, have extensive student advising experience.

Public Administration or Higher Education?,"I just graduated in May '14 with a BS in Public Health.  I was offered a position before graduation as a student advisor for a new program.  Basically, this is a grant-funded program that allows students a different pathway to get a degree.  

I have loved this for the past 4 months and now I am thinking about continuing my education.  Since I work for a university, I can take three free classes per year at any state-system university.  I would like to work my way up to Associate/Assistant Director, VP, President, Vice-Chancellor, etc.  

I know that the Higher Education route would be best for this type of work, but it also severely limits me to only doing university work.  A Masters in Public Administration would be the most versatile, but I am not sure if a university would look at a MPA for those positions.  I thought the best thing to do would be to look at actual job postings and see what they say.  I found a range of things from just having any Masters Degree, a Masters in HE, to having specific Master degrees for the area that the departments deal with. 

Any advice or suggestions?"
Recommendations for a master's program in higher education and student affairs?,"Hello all, and HAPPY SEPTEMBER! Good luck with move-in and fall term! 

I was wondering if anybody had any suggestions for a higher education and student affairs graduate program? I'm particularly interested in a counseling-based program-- that, or a program with a focus on student development. I'm not location-bounded, and have no preferences in regards to size, but it would be nice if the program offered many GAs for their students-- a GA in reslife is a MUST, as that is my area of passion. :) 

It would be an absolute PLUS if living partners are allowed in the res halls, as I'm engaged but don't plan to marry for another year or so.

Thank you all so much, and I hope y'all have a wonderful long weekend. "
"Access & ""Real Talk"" about college cost","I was watching a thread on Twitter yesterday from @istudentaffairs talking about how we need to be more realistic about talking incoming students and the overall cost of college. 

I'm torn. Part of me acknowledges that the amount of debt that you can leave with does not always reflect the amount of money you are going to make (I graduated with a BA in English and MA in Higher Ed/Student Affairs, which does not translate into how much I spent to get my degrees). I also recognize that without the loans I have accrued, I would not have been able to attend college. 

So, my question to you all of you lovely Reddit friends. How do you balance these two forces? Access to college being harder and harder with rising costs, but also have ""real talk"" about long-term implications of tuition costs and going into fields that may not yield a salary you can really live on, while paying off loans.

Scholarships for SA grad students?,"Hi friends! I'm starting my SA grad program in August. While my assistantship pays for a good deal of the program, there's a few thousand dollars worth of odds and ends not covered. I've been scouring the net for some scholarships to cover these extra fees, but everything that I've found is university-specific. 

During my time as an undergrad, I was heavily involved in student activities, a class officer for three years, and a Resident Assistant. I am sure there are at least a couple of scholarships out there that I can draw from these experiences with, but I can't find them. :( Any suggestions?"
Universities with bad reputations for Student Affairs Professional career development?,"Hi all,

This is a rather general and perhaps weird question. 

I am a student at a university that is highly ranked (think top 10 in the US News rankings) for undergraduate studies.

Students here have a long, historically fraught relationship with the Student Affairs Professionals that run the student-facing parts of the administration. 

Talking to friends at other universities, things just seem *so unusually bad* here relative to other similar universities. The vast majority of our administrators seem to actively detest our students. The few good people who are hired to our division of student affairs mysteriously seem to rage quit after six months at most (sometimes in a matter of weeks!). There is just a deep, persistent lack of mutual understanding and engagement between students and the student affairs professionals. As someone who has tried to get involved and participate in student opportunities to be involved in university governance (committees etc.), the expectations on students by administrators (but not by faculty!) are baffling and very contrary to the university's overall academic culture. For example, being honest and forthright while still polite in discussing issues upon which two people disagree (one being in power and the other being a student) is seen as being insubordinate and rude. Basically, it's like a repeated clash of cultures that never seems to heal. Going back years in the student newspaper, and speaking with alumni, confirms that this is not a new problem. Further, we have persistent problems with the *actual administrative* side of our student affairs division. Systems are broken, important emails go unanswered by relevant administrators such that student groups cannot meet deadlines, residential buildings have actually been condemned due to neglect in performing maintenance, etc.

Someone who used to work here in student affairs (but ended up transferring to a completely unrelated department) mentioned to me that our university has a really bad reputation as a place to work for Student Affairs Professionals, and thus we tend to get the bottom of the barrel. Basically, we have a problem attracting and maintaining talent. She argued that this was a huge part of the reason for our persistent problems. This caught me totally by surprise.

Is it true that some top universities are not considered 'top' in terms of career development for a student affairs person? Asking the question, it seems totally obvious now that the answer is probably 'yes' - you guys have career development concerns and are going to select places to work like any other human beings seeking employment. Is it possible for a top school to have a persistent problem attracting top administrative talent?

Help with Deciding a Right Path,"Hey everyone,

I just found this subreddit, and I am grateful that I was able to find like-minded people who are interested in discussing issues that are part of Student Affairs. I am extremely interested in getting into the realm of Student Affairs in Higher Education in the future, and I am hoping that some of you could lend a hand to help me achieve my endeavors.

A bit about me: I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Political Science. I decided that I wanted to continue studying Political Science and ultimately teach as a professor, so I decided to enroll in graduate school after a year off. I moved to my new school with all my belongings, but I came to the realization that Political Science was not for me during the second week of class, so I decided to drop out of the program. I came to the realization that I was truly interested in Student Affairs at a community college, and in a way, I always felt this way since my time as a student leader at my community college. I observed what my former advisor worked on and his responsibilities and the more that I thought about it, the more I wanted to be part of the field. In the future, I hope to be a Director of Student Affairs.

Basically, I am unsure of what I should do right now. In a way, I felt like I wasted my time and energy moving to a new school for my graduate program, only to withdraw from the university because I was no longer interested in pursuing a Master's degree in Political Science. At this moment, I am applying to community college jobs, specifically as a Transfer Specialist to help students with the transferring process. 

My question to all of you is: Is this the right path to take?

Thanks for listening and I really appreciate the help!"

We are looking to get rid of Sodexo and either go with another company (Aramark, Chartwell, Bon Appetit), run our own food service, or maybe look into having local restaurants cater/food trucks/co-ops. The only issue is that our school has very little money to throw around, so we need to know how cost-effective our options are.  Also, being the tiny, super-liberal college that we are, socially responsible/healthy/dietary restriction-friendly food is a major concern.

"Recent grad school graduate Looking for a position in programming, advice and leads are welcome! More details in comments. THANKS!","Hello Everyone,
     So here is the situation, I graduated with my M.Ed, in Curriculum and Instruction in the Spring on 2011.

I just recently completed my grad program in College Student Affairs. I was debating keeping the job search local, but realized I was better off giving myself the chance to relocate and really experience something new.

Stages of Team Development,"Hi everyone,

I've been tasked with putting together a training on the stages of team development in an interactive way. I am not quite sure where to start, and was hoping to get some suggestions.

Advice to pursue a PhD?,"I'm currently in a Master's program and have fallen in love with academic affairs more than student affairs and I am considering pursuing a PhD right after.

I think I am moreso questioning whether it would look bad if I pursued a PhD right after finishing my Master's."
EdS in Higher Ed,"I am thinking of pursuing my Education Specialist degree, EdS in Higher Education. But, is it worth it? The degree is 30 credit hours and can transfer into an EdD at a few other institutions, including their EdD program.

I have been gaining experience since 2015 (1 year Graduate Assistant, 3 years Residence Life, now in TRiO programs - Educational Talent Search) and have a Master of Science in Counseling - Clinical Mental Health. I have always had the goal of working in Student Affairs/higher ed and a long-term goal of teaching the subject of Higher Education/Student Affairs. While I really enjoy the work that I am currently doing, I am not in the student affairs sector, which worries me about staying abreast with current higher ed and student affairs lingo.

I think that I want to pursue a doctorate at some point but I also am afraid that if I do so now (with not a ton of experience) then I may over-qualify myself from other roles in the future. That's why I am considering EdS as kind of a mid-point degree that will give me more education that is higher ed specific. But, if I do this, then I will be in line to pursue my EdD and not a Ph.D. program. I see more people who are teaching with a Ph.D. and feel like that will set me up better to teach.

All that to say, I'm not really sure what to do. Will getting my EdD instead of Ph.D. affect my ability to become a faculty member in the future? Is getting an EdS a waste of time I could spend on doing a doctorate? Is it worth it?

Let me work it."
Advising a Student to Pursue Student Affairs,"Okay r/studentaffairs, outsourcing for a situation that I'm a little too close to. A former student that I know spent their undergraduate career working in housing, student conduct, and volunteering in other offices around their big state school, and then graduated and worked in housing for a year (live-in role similar to a hall director, but with fewer responsibilities - I don't think they had full-time status, but I'm not certain) with plans to apply to graduate school in the field that they graduated in. They recently had coffee with me and shared that they really like working in the college environment, really liked the work that they did in student affairs, and can't really decide what to do next.

I think that the student would be a perfect fit for student affairs, but they're really set on pursuing a PhD in a science field and teaching. They think that they could get involved in student affairs from the academic side, I think because their alma mater encouraged faculty to hold additional responsibilities around campus (ie; the LGBT organization on campus, cultural/religious centers, themed housing communities, are all directed by overworked faculty, with help from student workers, graduate assistants, volunteers, or occasionally one or two part-time staff). I get the impression that this isn't really the case everywhere else, and faculty are more removed from student affairs - can anyone share attitudes about this at their universities? General locations would be welcomed, or if anyone wants to message me with more specifics.

I want to make suggestions for other careers in student affairs that this person could pursue, but I'm drawing blanks. They don't like their role in housing, they don't want to continue in student conduct, and the other offices that they've encountered seem a bit too specific. But they're starting to lose interest in pursuing a PhD now, and I don't want them to be a statistic of PhD drop-outs. I feel like I may be too close to the situation to advise well."
Getting out of student media,"Anyone ever seen someone successful leap out of student media into the broader area of student affairs? I'm director of student media with about 7 years experience all at one university. I have my M.Ed. in higher education. 

My boss says he'd consider me for roles outside my area, but nothing has really come up. I've applied for a few other jobs (director of student involvement, associate director of student affairs, etc.) at other universities, but no one has really been interested. I think at most colleges the student media role is in a little bit of a silo, and maybe doesn't fit in with the larger area of student affairs. I'm great at engaging students, retaining them, building relationships, working across all departments; seems like transferable skills to other roles, but I'm going up against folks with 7-10 years experience who have jumped departments every year to two years, and rightly, they seem like safer bets. 

Any thoughts on how I can make myself look like a more well-rounded candidate. I even considered asking my boss to change my title to something like ""director of student engagement"" just so I can look like a more well-rounded candidate. Don't know that he would go for it, but I feel like the ""student media"" thing is a bit of a detriment to my advancement."

How to address the passive aggressive advisor in the room?,"Long story short: advisor is passive aggressive and it makes working as a team rough. Do I mention it to my supervisor or hr?

I’m an academic advisor for an online and military program. I am one of three advisors (supposed to be four but I’m filling the empty position as well till we file it), we report to a manager who reports to the associate provost of AA.
Two (and the empty position) are location at military bases while one advisor and the uppers are on main campus.
We deal with a lot of class cancellations due to low enrollment. So two weeks before class we call students in classes of one or two to move them to classes with three and four if possible, as long as it works with their degree program.
The manager asks that we communicate and work as a team to tackle all of this so we use google docs since it’s live.

One of the advisors started sending passive aggressive messages after I tried to communicate and help saying advisors have incorrectly advised his students in the past or didn’t tell him that they were advising the students. Out of the four of us, while we have mentioned it, we haven’t made a big deal bc we’re here to help and we can all do our jobs.
I helped one of his students who reached out to me. It wasn’t u til afterwards that I found out it was his student. So I let him know, forwarded what I sent the student and his facial expressions were very clear that he was upset about me helping the student.

Today (after all of this) I found out he’s been incorrectly advising my students and never once mentioned anything to me.

People make mistakes, but I’m tired of the passive aggressive “reply all” emails whether it’s towards me or not. It’s unprofessional and unnecessary.

A part of me just wants to mention to my supervisor that I don’t appreciate the emails and it’s rather hard to work as a TEAM with someone with that attitude just for the record. A part of me just wants to leave it alone.

Also it’s worth mentioning that I’m the only one that actually cares to better myself and do well with my job bc this is my field whereas the other two advisors are “stuck” and don’t care (they didn’t want to do evaluations and get feedback unless it was attached to raises).

Any thoughts how you would handle it?"

Also know that I would like to consider teaching on the side in addition to being a practitioner, but not be a tenured faculty member. I would like to continue furthering education at some point but I could use some perspective and various paradigms.  I really love what I am am learning in my counseling courses and would want to build upon that so that I can teach others and build and implement those in which ever student affairs functional areas I could see myself in (mostly first-year expereince, college access & success, Academic Support and Recovery Services, career services and development, academic advising, admissions, pre-college programs). What are your opinions on pursuing a doctorate in counselor ed vs. higher ed administration? When I was looking at various curricula of programs, I was not fairly impressed; but I did find counselor education intriguing from the Ed.D level. NOTE: I have heard various times, ""Focus on the present"" , but this is not definite something that I am going to do; I would just like insight. Would you all have any suggestions  in terms of program focus? I feel that I can learn administration one the job but counseling is something I find very specialized that takes learning in a classroom setting and actual practice, but I would like to hear different voices.

Supervising students vs. Grads vs. Entry level Pros in Student Affairs,"What are your thoughts? For me- 

Students are normally volunteer and trying to get Leadership experience to build their resume for the future. Task oriented. Do.

Grads - Want to go into field. More of a learning experience. They want to know more of the whys and should be educated on the processes and how what they are learning in the classroom applies to the work they are doing in their assistantship.

Entry level pros - Mostly in it for the long haul. Looking for experience to get them to the next step. Make sure they have their job/responsibilities down before allowing them to get that extra experience.  Learning their vision for their role and professional development to help them find methods to take them one step closer to their goals

I’m now asking (5-6 months into my job) to sit down and review my job description, update it, and talk about professional development opportunities (which they also don’t provide, they provide just for faculty).

Room Change Process?,"Hey guys, I'm slightly new to the Residence Life/ Student Affairs scene. I'm looking to compare and contrast college room change processes.

Afterwards, it would have to be an emergency in order for them to change rooms, or we do medications, and try to solve any particular issues the roommates have.

Building a Community in my classroom,"I’m a 2nd year (ish) Electrical Engineering Student. I am looking for a platform to use to connect with other students in my class. I want this to be something that is simple for everyone to use where we can post questions (with pictures), videos we like, set up in person/virtual study groups. I used to create Facebook groups for each class, which worked until everyone started hating FB. Also, it has distracting notifications.


I’m at a community college where the ages range from 18-30s and the students come from all over the world, thus needing something easy and simple that people will actually sign up for. 

I really want to do this ASAP, so I can announce it in my next class. Any suggestions are appreciated!

"Student loans, where do I start?","Hello! Me again! 

Posting twice in one day after being a long time lurker is weird, but I figured I’d try to ask for advice! 

I’ve completed two years of college, ( I plan on graduating with my associates in generals this December and want to transfer to a BA/BS program )  and I’ve been able to successfully pay for the whole experience with my own money, scholarships and FAFSA. 

Now, however, I’m realizing that there is next to no way to being able to pay for the university that I want to attend without taking out a good chunk of loans. I’ve let the idea of student loans scare me for such a long time, but I know that in order to go further into what I want, I need to get into a good school and take out loans. 

My request for advice is this:

-where do I start? I literally have no idea how student loans work.

-how do I take out loans? Do I need good credit? 

-do student loans only pay for school or will they help pay for housing? ( dorms, apartments, textbook, etc ) 

-do the student loans go directly to the school or me ooorrrrrrrr


Thank you all cool cats!

Any tips,"So I really want to pursue my masters in Student Affairs, but im really struggling to write an interest statement with professional goals. I feel like im over thinking it, but I may not be. Im super interested in the motivation and human behavior/development at the collegiate level and also looking at the various ways we communicate with each other and students. 

I soent 2 years working in housing (not as an RA though) and I learned a lot about the two above concepts honestly just from observing and interacting. I just dont know how to get it on paper. 


I really need to get it down though because one of my letters of rec wont write it until she reads this statement (even though shes had me for 2 years as a student)"
Has anyone benefited from online certification/training?,"Im entering my senior year of undergrad and am nervously in the grad school search. I want to do everything I can do make myself marketable, and thought about those certifications you can get online. The one that interests me is Psychological first aid, which helps in connecting individuals to professionals that can help with mental illness. Im trying to think of what I can do to show programs/employers that Im making an effort to be more qualified. 

Be honest, from the perspective of an employer or grad program, is this something that is worth mentioning or putting in a resume?"
What are my chances of getting an assistantship?,"Hey everyone, I recently decided to take the student affairs track with 1 year left in undergrad. It’s my mission in life to help students that were like me when I started college. I’m worried that I won’t get an assistantship, and end up lost not knowing what to do after.

I have lots of residence life experience, such as being a hall council exec member, desk assistant, Resident Assistant, Residence Hall Association exec board(attended housing conferences), National Residence Hall honorary president. I did summer orientation two years in a row as well as first week orientation two years in a row. I have undergrad research experience in special education(my former field), and I’m also participating in a unique internship this coming year that involves training service dogs on campus.

For whatever it’s worth, I’m hearing impaired and can reflect on my experiences being differently abled(and helping students who are the same way, as I planned to be a speech pathologist)

Can I just get your thoughts on my experience? It’s so difficult for me to find info and to measure my chances. I like to plan ahead and feel as secure as I can. There’s a placement exchange program in the spring that I’ll go to and I also plan on applying to a couple schools outside of that that require GAs. My goal is to get into housing with full tuition waiver."

Career in Student Affairs (Doctoral Level),"Since I was an undergraduate I knew that I always wanted to earn my degree in student affairs and I am delighted that I will be taking my talents back to my alma mater to earn my M.Ed in Counseling Psychology with a concentration in College Student Personnel Administration. With it, I want to be able to work primarily in College Access & Equity programs for middle and high school students. For example: TRiO programs, Higher Education Opportunity programs, outreach programs for middle and high school students, and pre-college programs. I have also considered work in academic advising, leadership education and development programs, admissions, and academic student success & retention programming. 

If I get into the area I would like to go into, college access, equity, and inclusion, I would like to work as a counselor/advisor for a few years and then work my way up. I could see myself in a Director's role where I am leading  college access & equity program and continuing and improving the vision for a program. 

I know that the master's program I am going to is counseling based and I will help me to utilize interpersonal skills and counseling techniques with students that I work with and that will be helpful. I know that I would like to pursue a doctorate once I have a good number of work expereince under my belt.

My goal for the doctorate would be to continue growing in knowledge of the profession and being able to apply that in the profession: hence to be a Practitioner-Scholar. I know that I do not want to have a position in academia. What I would like to focus on is in research concerning college access and equity for students of color and with students with invisible disabilities as well as researching transition from high school to college. I find it fascinating because it is a game changer in how a student is successful in higher education.

My question is what kind of doctoral program would be most useful and here are my thoughts:

1. Educational Leadership & Policy- Since I am looking to become a director, this would make the most logical sense since it deals with looking at educational policy and how it affects organizations of higher education. It would also get me to an area in which college access and equity are affected: policy. I firmly believe that in this area, knowing and applying policy and leadership in education will help future generations of students.

2. Higher Education/Student Affairs Administration- This is similar to the previous one above, but my only downfall is that it may fail to take into consideration anything outside of higher education. With what I want to get into, it involves looking at 6-12 and higher education together since what I am focusing on is college access and equity. Understanding both sides of the coin are critical to my knowledge about transition in terms of what happens in 6-12 but also what is happening in higher education.  I have examined some higher education admin programs but have not felt 100% about them unless I felt they met a certain need I might get.

So, What are you thoughts on this? All Advice is appreciated!"
Attending Graduate School at your undergraduate institution,"Hi everyone! I am beginning graduate school this fall at my alma mater to earn my M.Ed in Counseling Psychology with a Concentration in College Student Personnel Administration. Making the decision to attend my alma mater was NOT an easy one and I need some input on attending your alma mater for grad school and your expereince doing so and why. For the longest time, I had felt remorse for the decision I made but now I feel more confident in the decision I made. At times though, the feelings of my decision do come back. Let me break it down:

I applied to four graduate schools for student affairs administration in higher education (For purposes of anonymity I am going to call the schools by colors: purple U [my alma mater], U of orange, U of blue, and brown U [Not the actual university].)

I went through the motions of admissions and I received invites to interview from acceptances from all schools and an acceptance from U of Orange. Fast-forward, I did all my program interviews and/or assistantship interviews.

Here's what went down with acceptances:

Purple U- I received an offer of admission with my first choice assistantship I selected. From the interview day since I was an alumnus, since most everyone knows the campus, the process was pretty expedited and we wasted no time. I would have liked to chat with the current students a little bit which I did not have the opportunity to. Purple U was last on my list as a safety in case none of the other schools worked out; but it is a very strong and competitive program to get into (only taking 12 people per cohort so I was very fortunate to have received an *offer of admission*). Plus, they paid for all tuition and fees for each semester and I would get two practicums and two assistantships, guaranteed. I really loved the counseling emphasis of the program. My offer was time sensitive since it is an offer of admission and I only had a week to decide because they moved very quickly. Overall in my decision, I felt I needed to go somewhere different since I had been at the institution for 5.5 years as an undergrad. I felt that I would be reliving undergrad again, so I initially turned the offer down betting on other schools to give me an offer.

U of Orange- Even though I interviewed for 5 assistantships, they are technically not required to be a part of the program, but I knew I wanted one anyway. I waited for the longest time even after their spring break. No assistantship offers came in and it seemed like everyone else around me was getting offers left and right. I waited a LONG time, followed up, and nothing. (Even though I was admitted academically, an assistantship would waive the cost of tuition). I still waited on U of Orange for an offer even though I was accepted. They offered 12 month assistantships with health insurance that waived tuition but did not cover fees and the program was primarily administrative.

U of Blue- I was rejected from this school completely so it was a no-go there. It was not a right fit for me even during the assistantship interviews.

brown U [NOT the actual university]- This was probably the day I enjoyed the most. I had visited the school before hand because I had heard so many positive things about it and I was very impressed.  Everyone was most authentic there and there was a big emphasis on social justice. On the interview day, I had 8 interviews TPE style. Out of the 8,  I had gotten three 2nd round interviews. Followed up with them and I would hear back.  I was informed that the assistantships I interviewed with for 2nd rounds matched with other candidates. Hope was not lost because I found out weeks after I interviewed that I could interview with another site by phone that I did not interview with originally. I personally thought that this was a lot more work that I had to do especially going through the interviews. I still followed through any way. What I like about their program was its emphasis on social justice, student development theory, globalism (study abroad tours), and had a large alumni base. Their assistantships were 10 months but the catch was since my assistantships were off-campus, I would still have to pay tuition for a certain amount of credits and fees. In addition the cohort is much larger! 30+ per cohort. 

Here's the catch: Before I found out there was an opportunity to interview for another assistantship with brown U, I felt I had made a big mistake. I was in a bad spot with nothing to lean back on. U of Orange had not contacted me.  I felt bad rejecting Purple U so I called the coordinator and I told her my situation of not having any offers from any of the other institutions. She told me that if any other candidate declined that I would receive a second offer. Meanwhile, I set up my new assistantship phone interview with brown U. On the same day that I phone interviewed with brown, I received an offer from their assistantship site; but to make things tougher, I found out that someone from Purple U rejected an offer of admissions, so I received a second offer from my alma mater, purple U with my second choice assistantship preference. This time, I only had 24 hours to decide. To make things tougher, the offers I received for assistantships were all in the same area: Assistantship.

See the big decision?? brown with an offer from a ""wildcard"" assistantship site vs. purple with a second admissions offer and my second choice assistantship (which was my best interview). I was up all night trying to decide whether I would stay or go.

24 hours later, I had made the decision to stay at my alma mater purple and accept the offer; on the other side, I felt a bit of remorse because I had really connected with the people at brown and it felt genuine there. Purple on the other hand has a strong interview process and I have connections already. The interview day was different since it had purple alumni and current students interviewing only. I personally felt remorse with the decision of not choosing brown and it would take some time for me to know that I made the right decision with purple and staying at my alma mater.

So back to the question: Why did you decide to stay at your alma mater for graduate school? Did it give you advantages in the long run? I feel that staying where you went for undergrad can be stigmatized but I am learning that it's not always the case. Also, how did you handle being a graduate student and how did you differentiate yourself from your former undergraduate self? Is there something I am overthinking and overanalyzing with my decision? For those who have a spiritual life, how do you all view this? I am just really trying to come to peace and terms with my decision. I would really appreciate it!

Interesting in master's in student affairs but hear the field is saturated. Are there any areas that are in need of entry-level professionals and aren't saturated? Any areas to avoid?,"I currently work at a university but in a marketing role, and I think I want to transition out of public relations, but I like the university environment. If I quit to pursue the full\-time student affairs degree here, though, I'd need a job on the other end obviously, and I hear the field has become saturated.

Looking into Student Affairs career,"Hey y'all!

So I've been looking into transitioning to Student Affairs/Disability Services a few years down the line. I'm currently finishing up my master's degree in Occupational Therapy as a fall back plan if SA doesn't work. I'd like to inevitably develop/run a program for students with disabilities at a university... because then, that'd combine my two interests together.

I have an AA in Liberal Studies, a BA in Sociology, and a BS in Developmental Psychology. Unfortunately, I don't have much experience in student affairs, but I was a Peer Mentor for students with disabilities in UG, I was also a homework assistant for that population, both for about 2 years or so. I am currently an enrichment tutor for my master's program - between being an orientation leader, a tour guide for the new class, and a tutor, I did it all under that job title. Unrelated, but I was one of the Editors for our school newspaper, PR manager for this club called Adaptive Intramural and Recreational Sports, did tech support in school for 4 years, and tried to be involved as much as I could in different clubs like SGA.

I'm starting to apply for jobs, but I'm afraid that I'm not qualified for the position. What can I do to better my chances?"
Do I have a future in Student Affairs/Higher Education?,"Hello there. 
I am a 25 year old currently working in a non-profit (mainly data, administrative tasks and event support). I am strongly considering a master's degree in Student Affairs/Higher Education. A brief synopsis of my ""stats"":

-Degree: Bachelor in Health Services Administration
-GPA: 3.71 Overall 3.68 Major GPA
-Work Experience: During college I was a part of of TRiO, which focused primarily on supporting first-generation students. As A first-gen myself, I was highly involved during my school years, because a tutor for transitional students, was a part of creating the inaugural club for the program, etc. etc. 

My worry is that I graduated in 2014 so it has been 4 years since I have been in a college environment. During my time away from college, I worked an administrative role for a health insurance company for 2 years, as a teacher for 1, and currently as a data coordinator for a scholarship and mentorship nonprofit for high school students. 

I have a strong interest in career development/academic advising/first generation student support. It is something I have considered since my senior year of graduation, but never bit the bullet for. I just do not want to set myself up for disappointment. Would consideration for an assistantship be pushing it as well? 

Should I just settle for a master's in my current job description (an MSW or MPA) or should I take the risk and follow my heart?"

Social Media and Networking,"So, I have used social media since 2008 with Facebook. Instagram, Snapchat, and Tumblr followed after when I entered college. I tried Twitter briefly but I really did not like it. The only network I use online is LinkedIn. As I transition to graduate school I know that social media is more critical than ever in connecting with others, especially students; however, I have personally stopped using social media for the sake of my mental health. I lost sleep and even felt waves of depression and low self-esteem from using it. I feel like sometimes I am missing out on conversations if I don't have social media and I have been debating whether I will go back. I have found it better for me to stay away from it because it can become visual noise if the proper filters are not put in place to make for a productive time on social media. If I were to go back, it would at most be Facebook and Twitter. What is some advice you all have? Am I  weird for limiting my social media?"
Student Affairs in Higher Education Masters Programs- Advice,"Hi everyone!

I am new to the Reddit society so this is like my maiden voyage. I am graduated about a year ago and took a gap year to get away from academi

I have just applied to 4 Student affairs programs for the 2018-2019 academic year:

James Madison University: Counseling Psychology, College Student Personnel Administration (my alma mater)

The University of Tennessee-Knoxville:College Student Personnel 

University of North Carolina @ Greensboro:  Student Affairs Administration in Higher Education

Bowling Green State University: College Student Personnel.

I am really excited to see where I am accepted. As I think about the process, I am thinking about all the factors to consider. Some major factors I am considering:

1. Cost- With a good amount of student debt on my shoulders, I am really considering everything I can to think about *reducing debt as much as possible while also choosing a program that has a great fit.* I am originally from Virginia so JMU would be the only school being in-state. I am also considering tuition and fees (especially fees because they add up). Right now every program covers tuition in some way or form.

2. Personal Growth & goals- I was at my alma mater as an undergrad for 5.5 years and so I have spent a lot of time. I am sort of in a dilemma as to whether I need a new experience going out-of-state or whether I should stay at my alma mater. I know that one of my long term career goals is to be a College Planning Education Consultant so I am looking at doing an internship hopefully. I would also want experience in enrollment management (financial aid and admissions), academic advising, and career services.) I 

3. Curriculum & Practical Experiences- This was something I looked closely at seeing the courses. Some have rigid curriculum where every class is mapped out and some have required courses with a choice of electives from different areas. I know that I have an interest in Counseling and Student Development & Learning. Personally, I am not sure which type of curriculum I would go for. I have looked at the curriculum and researched every course description. In addition, I know the amount of experiences that each program has (assistantships, internships, and practicum.)

4. Cohort Size- I have considered a small cohort and a large one. Each having their pros and cons.

So, there's the overview of my thoughts in a nutshell. What are your thoughts and do you all have some suggestions to think about as I consider decisions in the admissions process?

Grad School: How much to talk in class?,"Hi, all.

I'm in my first semester of a student affairs MA program.  My class is 27 people or so.  

I am trying to gage how often I should contribute to conversations.  There are few students in the class who are disengaged, and everyone has a different opinion on a topic.  Everyone wants to share what they've experienced, learned or created.  I worry that sometimes I contribute a little too much.  I have asked classmates if they think so, and they haven't noticed, but I'm feeling this way for some reason.

How do you ensure that you speak enough to earn the maximum participation points for the class, but also give others a chance to earn their points and contribute to the conversation?  Always having something to say has been nothing but advantageous for me in my education, but now I'm in a class of folks with the same inclination and I'm not sure how to conduct myself.

For example, do community college jobs pay more? Do big universities pay more? .. etc. Similarly, is there an areas of student affairs that tends to pay a little more than others? Any personal experience from people working in this field would be greatly appreciated :)

Handling small on-campus apartment with a partner + pet,"Hi All, I'm a residential director at a small private school. I have a partner and a dog whom I live with in our on campus apartment. But things are getting tough. Our apartment is a very small one bedroom and it's getting to be really frustrating to come home from work sometimes after 10-12 hours to a space I don't and can't event enjoy. We painted, added cupboards, shelves, pictures/decor, etc, but it just... sucks. 
Recently, I requested to move apartments to an apartment in another building. My request was denied, as it is further from campus and will have fewer than 150 students in it.

Can universities fix grades?,I'm a psychology student at a university near London. I heard that our lecturers just moved everyone's grades down last year after the exams. Can they just do that? It seems really unfair. It was multiple choice so even though we got the answers right they reduced the marks. its not like moving grade boundaries at GCSE or A-level. There are a lot of people who will graduate with lower grades now. Does this happen anywhere else and what can we do about it?

Role of graduate students in student orgs?,"Hi, first time poster!

I'm a first year graduate student (in urban planning) at a large public university, and I'm involved in a few student organizations to gain leadership experience I've felt like I didn't get in undergrad.

My question is, should I just act like a regular student and try to stay the course, or should I become a coadvisor and have (what I perceive to be) a more conventional role?"
Have I messed up too badly?,"Hello this may not be the best subreddit for my questions and concerns but I couldn't find any better place to ask these questions, so please forgive me if this isn't the right place. 

I'm a sophomore at a local in state university and as of last spring semester I was put onto academic probation as I was struggling with a full 18 credit course load on top of depression and growing anxiety of being overwhelmed with all the new information and life style that comes with being on my own and in charge of my life. 

This being said as I came into this fall semester I decided to reach for a more difficult engineering major and decided that because I was on academic probation and behind in the study as far as course go I needed to take a rugid bit light 15 credit course load. 

However I ended up taking Chemistry(which I never took in high school) and an advanced physics course for engineering majors. I did not do well as the new concepts of chemistry was very difficult to learn and so I spent too much time on that one subject meanwhile everything else didn't get much time focused on it. This led to me getting a horrible GPA of a 1.55 for this semester and dragging my cumulative GPA down under a 2.0 when my goal for this semester was to achieve a 2.2 at the bare minimum to appease my academic progress plan. 

I feel like such a failure after actually putting as much effort into the semester as I could and so far the college has dismissed me and has offered an appeal process for both the dismissal and a reevaluation of my academic standing and financial aid. 

I'm going to try to appeal this but I came here looking to see if anyone has any advice as to what my next steps should be. 

Any thoughts and/or advice is helpful. "

Employment Outlook in Campus Recreation?,"Title basically sums it up - does anyone in this community have any insight into the employment outlook for the campus recreation field?

The only thing I can find online is the obvious - NIRSA and its job board, and even there one can only make an observation on the job board, can't find any hard data on job numbers. 

Background: I got my bachelors in Kinesiology with a focus on Sport Management a few years ago and spent 3 years working in campus rec during undergrad, and my current job is relatively similar, so I have solid experience and a few contacts in the field. Obviously I will gauge their opinions as well, but I wanted to tap into the collective knowledge of this community. Thanks in advance for the help. "
I go to a chill university... I ended up here.,"Hey everyone.

Let me put it to you this way, I want to feel like I'm the next Mark Zuckerburg at Harvard, when I wake up and go to university.

I'm in law school at the moment, but man, I go to school in North Wales and the people here are just too chill and leave class to go shopping and utter nonsense like that.

I'm an beginner app developer, budding business person and overall creative guy, but since I left my hometown of Toronto, Canada and came to Wales the cutthroat and creative version of myself has left and been a bit replaced by a chill, relaxed and more lazy version of my self. 

What do you guys recommend to get that go go go mojo back and become super extremely hard working again? 

A big thank you. "
Too many units to change majors?,"I'm a student at UCI that transferred from a JC last year.  I'm wanting to change majors and meet the general GPA requirements, but I've been denied for two listed reasons:

-I have too many units

-I don't have a particular class that completes the general intro classes for the major


I explained that I was willing to go back to a JC to get the class I needed and reapply, but was told that probably wasn't an option since I already had too many units.

Why is having too many units a bad thing?  Do I have any other obvious options that I'm not seeing?"

Help Share Info on Research Study on Men Who Survived Sexual Violence During College,"My name is Dr. Dan Tillapaugh, and I am a faculty member in the Higher Education program at the University of Maine. In the information below, I have provided some further insights about my research study on men who have survived sexual violence and/or coercion in college over the past 10 years.

Background of the Study: Issues of sexual violence at colleges and universities within the United States have been prominent in the media for many years. However, in recent years, increased attention and enforcement of Title IX and governmental oversight has shown a bright spotlight on the issue for many colleges and universities. As a result, campus administrators have devoted greater efforts at education and outreach on issues of sexual violence on campus. Yet, much of the conversation around gender-based or sexual violence tends to reinforce the fallacy that women are the only victims of sexual violence on college campuses.

Purpose of the Study: This study aims to understand the experiences of men (either cisgender or transgender) who have survived sexual violence and/or coercion during their college experience (this could be during one’s undergraduate or graduate school experiences) within the past 10 years (between 2005-2015). In particular, this study aims to understand their experiences in reporting (or deciding not to report such violence), the support (or lack thereof) they received from campus administrators, faculty, peers, and families, and what resources, services, and initiatives they wish campus administrators would know about men who are survivors of sexual violence on campus.

Procedure: Individuals who wish to participate will be interviewed twice, with each interview taking approximately one hour, during the summer and fall of 2015. These interviews will be conducted with the researcher via phone or by Skype, whichever the participant prefers. Additionally, participants will be invited to an optional online focus group in spring 2016 following initial data analysis. Given the sensitive nature of the topic, participants are welcome to have a support person (such as a close friend or family member) with them during the interviews. In all parts of the study, you can choose to skip any questions that you would prefer not to answer. You can also stop your participation in the study at any time without judgment or question.

Contact Information: To learn more about this study or to express interest in participating, please visit my research study website at www.cmsvsurvivors.com or you can e-mail me directly at daniel.tillapaugh@gmail.com

Your help is much appreciated in spreading the word about this study.  Please consider sharing the link (www.cmsvsurvivors.com) on your social media sites and also to professionals on your campus (such as Title IX Coordinators, health and wellness professionals) who might also be willing to share it with others.  Thanks so much for any and all help you can provide!"

What do admission deferrals look like to grad programs?,"This week I received admission into both the University of Miami (OH) Higher Education and Student Affairs program and University of Maryland's program. I could not be happier/ more excited as the impending meteor of graduation hurtles toward my senior year, but things may get complicated. 

Earlier this year I applied to and progressed to the last round of interviews for being a traveling consultant for my fraternity. The applicants who progressed to this final round with me are all waiting to hear back from the fraternity still. Now after receiving admission to my favorite programs, I am worried that I might be extended a job offer. If I accept the job with my fraternity, I am anxious about what deferring my admission might say to these programs. Any advice if I get the fraternity job? Or, what does an admissions deferral say to you?"
Question about Career path,"Hello All,

I'm in an interesting conundrum about attending graduate level education in Higher Education/Student Affairs.  

During undergraduate I had several para-professional positions (RA/Student Orientation) and really enjoyed my experience.  After graduating I've worked several years in the non-profit/advocacy world and have managed to hold several mid-level managerial positions for major nonprofit. I have about 5 years of profesional experience in LGBTQ/Advocacy related work and am in the 40 - 60k salary range.

I love my current work but I have nagging need for more education and a real love for student leadership development (I've specifically focused on the training of LGBTQ students in advocacy skills). 

I've been accepted to a great HESA program, but I'm concerned that in many ways it will be a step back for me monetarily.  Will my past experience help me into higher positions that would have better pay than most out of grad school jobs?

Also I have another internal dilemma if I want to go all the way and obtain my doctorates? Do any of you have good sources for the higher potential of a phd in Higher Ed or Administration?

I really appreciate any insight!"

Is it too late for me?,"Hello all, I am a 27 year old undergrad finishing up my BA in English and have an Associates in Accounting. During my tenor in school I have been president of a 2 clubs(two diffrent schools), creator of another, member of SGA, worked on filming an oral history of the school with the head of the Anthropology department and in the last year have worked closely with the Director of Student Affairs. Through all this I have learned I found a certain joy in creating events  and programs to help unite the populace.

Despite my passion, my gpa is still rather weak (2.8 for my major). Is it too late for me to make a route towards working in student affairs after college? I am graduating soon and I cant imagine my life without the stress of juggling a bunch of various events with nothing in common and learning something new every day. Is there anything I can do to continue what I've been doing while at school?

When to follow up on an RLC interview,"Hello student life friends!

Can undergraduate resident assistants be made to clean up bodily fluid as part of their expectations?,"I am a (graduate assistant) Hall Director at a small semi-rural university. The university does not have extensive resources when it comes to handling situations after hours. Part of the expectations of the on-duty resident assistants is that they will clean up bodily fluid ""spills"" if found after hours, or over the course of the weekend. They are given small kits with absorbent powders, expected to scrape all of the mess into a bio hazard bag, and then leave the bag in the hall office until the next morning or Monday. 

Resident Assistants at this particular university have never received any specialized training for this type of endeavor and it is usually a ""learn as you go"" experience for them. While I'm sure you are all aware of the broader context of why I am posing this question, I would like to keep responses general as to whether it is even legal to require undergraduate staff to clean up bodily fluids, inclusive of blood, vomit, and urine as part of their expectations. 

Edit: Are there any other subreddits I could xpost this question to? 

Update: According to the individual at OSHA that I spoke with over the phone today: if the bodily fluid does not contain blood then it doesn't fall under the regulations associated with medical waste and ""blood born pathogens"". As such, there is no specifically mandated training required, but the institution should have ""some form"" of training where the staff members who are expected to clean up vomit and other fluids are shown proper procedures and informed of communicable diseases.

Need-Based vs. Need-Blind Admission,"What are your thoughts on schools that practice need-based admission vs. need-blind admission? I was very much against the idea of need-based admission but, after working at a fairly pricey school and having to tell countless gifted students that they can't afford to attend their dream school, I'm starting to think need-blind admission might not be the great equalizer it tries to be. 

Perhaps it works in schools that can afford to offer full rides to their underprivileged students but not at schools that have a gap between their maximum financial aid award and the cost of attendance?

I've also heard it argued that it isn't so much that schools are need-blind; they're need-ignorant. Institutions don't have time to consider if a student could afford to attend because they're too busy trying to fill beds/seats at the beginning of the admission process.

What do you think?"
Can I Pick Your Brain?,"Hi everyone, and thanks in advance for reading and responding.  I'm a financial educator who is considering specializing in young adults/collegians.  Unfortunately, most collegians have no money :)  It has occurred to me that the people who have the funds are often the collegiate organizations, such as sports teams, departments, social organizations, etc.  I'm concept testing a financial education program that would be brought to the group/school by the ""grown ups.""  Do you see a need for financial education in higher education?   In your experience, is this the type of thing that your school would support?  Is there a better way to find the people with the checkbook power, or is it very different at each school?

Thanks for helping support students - you do an important job and as a parent, I appreciate it!"
Certification VS MA in Student Affairs (or related),"Good Afternoon Fellow Redditors,


tl;dr:

1. Is a certificate for student services/affairs worth it or should I get a post-bacc degree? I have a BA in English. I have lots of experience in the career services department but nothing else from my University.

2. Can I start from the bottom and work my way up a career ladder in this field? I am prepared and determined to do that.

**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**

I am researching a few career paths to figure out where I should go next. I graduated in May 2013 and was fortunate to get a decent job (experience-wise) right out of college. I work as the Reading Intervention Specialist at an Elementary school. Essentially I work with various students from Kinder to 3rd grade who score below grade level reading averages. I work with them on a very intriguing computer program run through Scientific Learning, and I also coordinated and manage an after school reading program.

There are many things I love about my job, but I can't stay here. I've always had an interest in Student Affairs, and there are a few jobs I've got my eye on. However, **I feel unqualified.** Some of these jobs ask for an MA, but others don't. 

[This Article](http://chronicle.com/article/Getting-a-Start-in-Student/125391/) states that getting a certificate could be an alternative route, but I don't want to waste my time. From your experience, do you think the certificate is worth the time/money, or should I look at an MA path? I already turned down a graduate school that accepted me this year. While I want to go to grad school eventually . . . It doesn't seem logical for me to get a degree in something I'm not even sure I want to do.

Advice,"Hello everyone! I am here to vent/ & or seek advice from professionals that are already working professionals in Student Affairs.

I wanted to know how difficult it is to succeed in this field if I wanted to pursue a career in advising? The reason I ask is I am scared of the job market, I notice there would be one or two advising positions here and there and I heard they were really competitive, e.g 500 applicants for one advising position? I know it’s based on experience which I have been trying to get but won’t even get hired for entry positions at local universities. I have started looking into Human Resources as another possible career path because there is a huge demand in employment. I am stuck because although I’m not enthusiastic in pursuing business and management and my expertise is not in the field I feel I would only pursue it because of job security but my passion is to be a Latina In Higher Ed & eventually maybe someday be a program coordinator or director, but I’m scared if I get a MA in Student Affairs it would be hard to find a stable job & also accumulate debt... does anyone have any insights or advise?"
Who to send a follow up email to: the decision maker or committee?,"I had my first interview at my dream job back in June with the search committee. I had the second round interview with the three people who “make the decision” since they’re the higher ups a couple weeks later.

The interviewer told me their institution is also doing hiring for higher-up positions (like Dean of Students) and it may take a bit for htem to meet with who they need to to discuss about which candidates to bring on campus, and they told me to hang tight and I'd either receive an e-mail from them or someone in HR. Like I said, the interview went really well and I'm fairly confident that I will be selected for an on-campus interview. I interviewed two weeks ago, for reference.

I was just selected for an on-campus interview with a different institution. I likely will not be going there until the last week of June. I am worried about going to the on-campus and having it be a quick turnaround and have them offer me the job the next day or something. The first institution is my ""top choice"" for jobs, but of course that may change when I do the on-campus for the second institution.

This turned into a ramble. Would it be annoying if I e-mailed the interviewer at the first institution and asked about their process/if they know if I'll be selected for an on-campus? If it wouldn't be, how should I word it?"

PhD Funding - Where can I find it?,"Hey, y’all! I just got accepted into a Higher Ed PhD program and I’m super excited. It’s at the institution I work at because I get some tuition benefits, but I’m honestly really hoping to go full-time at some point. From what I can tell, there are some scholarships available, but nothing as far as full-funding opportunities right now. I gather because the program has historically been mostly made up of people working full-time and attending part-time.

Graduate School Appliction Help,"Hi everyone! After a year and a half out of school in the ""real world"" I finally am ready to apply to grad school for higher ed.

I have somewhat forgotten how to write well after being out of school for so long and I'm not even quite sure how these essays are supposed to be written.

Pre-College/College Access,"Hey everyone! I am getting ready to start my degree in the fall for Student Affairs. I just had a summer job working for a pre college enrichment program that basically allows high school students a collegiate expereince on a college campus. This ranges from Prep courses, academy courses, and summer college courses (for credit). After expereincing this and seeing the range of possibilities I realize pre college/ college access programs are my primary areas that I would like to pursue, in addition to academic advising, admissions, and First-Year Expereince as alternative s. 

Within Pre-College/College Access, I know there is : TRiO, Education Opportunity Programs, college access non-profits, Summer Bridge programs, and seasonal Pre-College programs (summer programs/ dual enrollment). Within this, I would like to consider working with underrepresented student populations, including first gen students.

My questions are first if there is any scholarly literature from practitioners on these matters, second, are there people with expereinces in pre college programs for high school and /or middle school students, and lastly, what are some recommendations in terms of functional areas to get involved in since my campus does not have an area available like this? 
"
Assistantship/Practica Options,"I will be a first-year graduate student this fall and I am trying to be as prepared as possible to know exactly what expereinces I would like to have. I will be back at my alma mater, JMU in their College Student Personnel Program that requires (an) assistantship(s) for two years [1 assistantship for 2 years or 2 assistantships for two years... I will be going for the second option]. It also requires two practica. The practica can be done with both during the school year or one during the school year and one during the summer (typically after the first year, which I will most likely do).

As I am thinking about my goals and what I want long term,

Career-wise, I am thinking primarily about going into: 
-**Pre-College, TriO, Higher Education Opportunity, and Summer Bridge Programs** (1st Choice)
-**First-Year Experience** (Focusing on programming for First-Year Students after Orientation)
-**Academic Advising** and/or **Career Services & Development** but preferrably Academic Advising

I already have my first Assistantship set in Leadership though the Dux Leadership Center. My options for my second assistantship are briefly:

1st Choice- Centennial Scholars Program- basically a program designed for underrepresented student who receive financial support, as well as mentorship, and service opportunities throughout their four years. This one struck me as the go to since I want to work in an area like this after grad school.

2nd Choice- Career & Academic Planning- Due to my interest in Academic Advising and Career Services, this would be a great assistantship to go into especially since I would like to start out as an academic counselor or advisor in Pre-college/Higher Ed/Summer bridge/TriO programs

3rd Choice - Academic Student Services- I think this is important because some students will have tough spots in their life and this office helps with the recovery of students who have have faced some type of academic disciplinary action. It's especially good to understand when working with students looking to succeed in college.

For practicum during the summer I am looking at getting trying to do an internship with a TRiO Upward Bound program or one of similar nature with NODA or ACUHO-I. For the practicum during the academic I am looking here are my options:

1st Choice- Practicum with **Blue Ridge Community College**- Basically I would get expereince working at a community college in a variety of functional areas including: counseling, academic advising, career services, admissions, learning communities, student activities, learning support, and disability services. This would also allow me to get a different expereince outside of JMU since I know JMU really well.

2nd Choice- **Bridgewater College- Career Services**- Another option to consider that is off campus at a nearby institution since , again, getting away from JMU would be good and would also fit into the areas I am looking at long term.

-------------------The rest on this list are all on campus practica--------------------

3rd Choice- Diversity Office

4th Choice- Financial Aid

5th Choice- Diversity Office

6th Choice- Center for Assessment and Research Studies- Student Affairs Assessment Support Services

Preparing for an Interview,"I would like to ask for any recommendation or advice from you. I have an interview in two weeks for an advisor position at an institution that I currently work at. The minimum requirement for the job is Bachelor's with 3 years of advising experience and preferred is Masters.

I have my bachelor's and am working on my masters; however, no advising experience. I have cross-trained at that office in the past and know the office and full-time and student employees really well since we are all in the same department. I have written in my cover letter that I have been studying responsibilities and policies relating to the position since cross-training at the office to be more qualified.

I feel that I am getting an interview because 1. they know me and 2. I have talked to the dean of the department and discussed my concern about not getting an interview (the HR apparently rejected my application because I don't meet that three-year advising experience). Whatever the case is, I am very grateful to have this opportunity to do my best and show them that I am indeed qualified for the position.

I have been preparing different examples/stories on how I may lack experience but not the skills to advise. What other things I can say or ask at the interview to stand out more? What can I do to prepare myself more? Any advice would be appreciated."
Question about discrimination,"Hello I have a quick question regarding a situation regarding a graduate school I am familiar with, and I was hoping to get some insight.

The Graduate School in question has many upper level defense and national security personnel acting as faculty, however the school is a non-profit, open institution eligible to anyone who applies and is accepted (including international students).

I'm hearing that a student from the Middle East (I believe from Iran), may be denied entry to the school because certain members of the faculty have a problem teaching subjects pertaining to national security to citizens of countries the USA does not have a good relationship with.

However, this student is already studying in the states on a F-1 Visa, and according to the government should be allowed to study wherever he chooses and gets accepted too. Mind you, this institution is public, not private, and the faculty member in question is only upset because he claims his security clearance won't allow him to work with this type of student.

Any thoughts?"

Higher Ed College Planning Consulting- Post Masters Credentials,"So, I have been doing some research on what is needed to become an College Transition Counselor/College Planning Consulting. I have been researching credentials that I would need beyond the master's degree. I am planning on getting my masters in College Student Personnel (Administration)/Student Affairs Administration [however you would like to call it]. After working for an office of my choice, I would like to begin eventually working part-time as a consultant taking on only a few clients. Another certification I would need is a College Educational Planner (CEP) certification by the IECA (Independent Educational Consultants Association) by UC Irvine.  
The other thing is that I have considered is a doctoral degree; however with the topic matter of college planning and transition, I am not sure what doctoral degree I should be pursuing or even if a doctoral degree should be something looking towards. One of the reasons, I would want to pursue one is to understand educational issues at the secondary level of education, how that impacts college readiness,  and what can be done about that in present day. I also would like to focus on diversity, inclusion, and equity measures for all students to have the opportunity to apply for college with the vary degree of diversity in our society today. The only degrees I have seen that would be compatible are the Ph.D or the Ed.D. When I was looking, I was more attracted to the Ed.D. In my opinion, the Ph.D I don't think would meet my goals necessarily since I want to span outwards in having my own small business. I could be missing something but do you all have any input? I know that educational leadership is the main umbrella term which this falls under but are there some specific areas of some programs that you all would recommend I start looking?"

Question About Student Rights for Working Outside of Class,"I am curious what rights students have in terms of working difficult hour outside of class.

I am currently in a class where, in addition to having our four hour classes twice a week, we must work outside of the class every single day, including weekends to work on a group project (with no division of labor, which in a team of 15 people makes progress nearly impossible). I am used to doing work outside of class, especially with groups, this but this class in particular requests an unreasonable amount of time from me. 

I would mention the fact that we had to stay here for spring break and work from 9:30-6 but that was an expectation that was voiced before I joined the class. Instead, I would like to talk about all the other times that our teacher expects us to literally work throughout the night to complete our work, all of which is subjectively graded. Every single day our group meets for hours on end to complete work that our teacher ultimately tells us she doesn't like. She tells us this in class, sends us to work on it outside of class, and then in class continues to criticize our work instead of working on it with us while we are together, creating a cycle of endless criticism and fruitless work.

Most nights I am working from 5PM until 10 or 11PM which I have gotten used to, but last night our teacher and TAs wanted us to work until 2AM. I understand that some students are used to that kind of timeline and even thrive on it, but I always set myself up to not have to face those kinds of time restrictions. This is a group project so everyone is expected to work together all the time. 

Instead of staying until 2AM I left at midnight, explaining how I have work today and didn't think getting a decent night of sleep was a large ask. However, I was reprimanded for my early exit (at midnight) and was told that I was not meeting the expectations of the class and was not respecting people's time. 

I want to ensure that I am protected from getting a poor grade simply because I worked from 9 to 12 instead of 9 to 2AM, or even 3, 4 or 5AM as some of my classmates have.

Any advice or guidance would be very helpful in navigating this hellish nightmare of a class. Thank you"

Entering Job Market Advice,"Hey everyone! Just for some background, I'm a senior at a UC graduating in mid-June with a double major in neurobiology and music, and I was hoping to get some advice regarding attaining a position in academic advising.


This past school year, I've been working for our music department as a peer advisor. Since I pursued a double major and experienced a somewhat less conventional and more hectic college curriculum pathway, I've advised a lot of students with primary fields of study within and outside of the department. Through training for the position alone, I gained familiarity with the typical advising approaches the university advisors use and those endorsed by NACADA, e.g. holistic, appreciative, narrative, etc., and I'm also about to finish an Academic Peer Advising Certificate program offered by the school's advising center. I've consistently held student leadership positions since my sophomore year and have a lot of experience with student outreach for individuals of diverse backgrounds.


Are there any specific things I should be doing when I apply for entry-level academic advisor positions, and if I'm graduating in June, when's a good time to seriously start applying? During interviews, I plan on highlighting specific experiences employing certain advising techniques and my ability to work with diverse student populations and understand the present-day issues they face.


Also, how good/bad are my chances of landing a job in California specifically, given that I don't possess a master's? I'm aware that it would make me more qualified, but if possible, I would rather go into the industry after college and complete a master's part-time a few years down the road once I'm more financially settled.


Thank you so much in advance!"

"Risky Student Housing Options, help!","I have two options. 

1. On campus housing guaranteed 2 semesters. (over $700/month)
2. Basement suite one year lease. 7min walk to school. (under $600/month)

Tricky part:
I have co-op terms randomly placed, so like this school year I have one second semester. Next year I will have one first semester and then that summer. So if I got with option 2, I will need to sublet to a female (landlords only request) during these 4 month co-op terms. Usually people who take those sublets are other students who are coming back from a co-op and need a place to stay while they are back at school, or else exchange students that come for a semester. So if I don't find someone to sublet to then I have to pay empty rent. Whereas with option 1 I can just leave with no financial penalty. However, the next year I will have to apply first come first serve to on campus housing for second semester which may or may not work in my favour depending how many spots they have open.

Grad Program that Offers Assistantship with Veteran Student Services,"Hi /r/studentaffairs!!!

I'm hoping someone here can point me in the right direction? It's getting to that time of year where I'm looking at graduate schools to get my MEd. I would love to go to school in the south, (preferably a state that is not land locked), or in Washington state. However, the biggest criteria is that the program offers an assistantship with the school's student veteran programs. 

My interest in working with veteran students came on an epiphany when I was working my school's summer orientation program and I was with transfer students and one of them happened to be a vet. For once, I was dumbfounded about not knowing of any resources for this student.

I've found only one school, University of Texas at Austin, that has an assistantship with their Vet Programs. Any other suggestions on schools I should check out would be greatly appreciated. Even if it's not within the location I mentioned.

Should I pursue a career in student affairs?,"Hello everybody, I hope you are having a wonderful whatever time of day it is where you are!

I will be graduating this spring, and I am seriously considering Masters programs in Student Affairs, but I would like to have some candid conversation about the topic. 

I am a non-traditional student. I dropped out of college when I was 22, and returned when I was 28. I am now just a few credits shy of a BS in Sociology from Oregon State University, and I will be 32 when I graduate. I identify as male. I do not have a stellar transcript, due mostly to my first attempt at school, but also to a few hiccups along the way. I will graduate with a GPA in the 3.4 range, but my main worry is some unfortunate withdraws and a few F's that remain on my record from ten years ago.

That being said, I have had so many amazing opportunities my second go round. I quickly became an officer in Sociology Club (three years running now) and an advocacy group for incarcerated peoples. I have studied inside of prisons as part of the Inside Out program, I have studied abroad with a group in Cuba, and alone as an independent studies project in Nicaragua, I have presented at two conferences and will present at one more this spring, and I was selected to visit the White House for a seminar put on by some big names, including the First Lady. All of these opportunities came to me because I worked for them, applied myself, got to know my professors and others on campus who encourage me to apply. 

The difference between me now and then is amazing, as my first go round I was shy, participated in nothing, and really didn't want to be in school. My desire is to help people realize their full potential and to connect them with the endless learning opportunities at our institutions. 

I think that Student Affairs is for me, but aside from my few acquaintances who work in the field, I don't know much about what you actually do. So I'd like to ask two questions, and a bonus. 

1) What does your job currently entail, and are you happy?
1) What advice do you have for a person looking into Masters programs?
Bonus) Should I go for it?

As an afterword, I am interested in practice, but I also have a background in, and love, research. I am also a theory nerd. Unfortunately most programs I have looked at don't place much emphasis on either theory or research. Any thoughts?

Thank you so much :)

Volunteerism in student run clubs,"I'm a graduate, but I still help out the biology club at my alma mater. So whenever I have a free moment I like to look up current events and interesting bio articles and pass them along to the current president. This helps her out because then she doesn't have to come up with the week's discussion topic and if the club is holding any type of event I like to look up some easy science projects to help keep interest in this academic clup rolling.
So here's the thing, the current president asked my opinion of how to advertise for a trash pick-up they are having in the near future. The club likes to do at least two trash pick-ups a semester (trash pick-ups usually consist of going along road sides and picking up trash.) and the first one of the semester is coming up real soon. But, nobody likes to spend a couple hours out of their day to get dirty and help keep America beautiful. Does anyone have any advise on how to advertise for a trash pick-up (or similar event) in a way that even non-members may respond positively to? Even a new way to advertise might help. We traditionally use paper posters around the science building on campus and a few more on the advertising boards found around campus. There isn't a huge budget for advertising, but any advise would help a ton! Thanks!"

Graduation Situation with my University,"I am currently a Senior at a small private university in Austin, Texas. For the past 4 years I went from Accounting, Accounting Information Technology, to Computer Science which is the degree I will graduate with. 

I spent my freshman year of college at UTSA (sorry so this is my 5th year total in college, 4 at this private school) where I took a 4 hour German class because it was required there. This will come in to play later

I have been advised by 3 different advisors (because of degree changes) and up until 2 days ago, none of them told me I still needed 2 hours of German which is a University wide policy. I talked to my advisor, dean, and VP of Academic Affairs, but none of them are putting any responsibility of this complete screw up on the hands of my advisors. They say I either have to take another 3 hours at COmunity College or CLEP it to get my degree this Spring. 

To me this is completley unfair that I have to do this. I was never told the past 4 years about this until my current advisor brought it to my attention. I dont remember a word of German and dont have time to study considering my LIFE starts this summer. I am working and doing rigorous course work.

Capstone on Athletics. Help?,"I am beginning my capstone for my Master's in Higher Education soon and am asking for help with sources/topics.

Any ideas on how I could narrow this focus or sources to consider?

What makes a complete bulletin board/program proposal? (x-post from /r/ResLife),"Hey everyone!
I am trying to put a resource together for my RAs as to what makes a bulletin board or program proposal ""complete.""

Any help would be much appreciated!"
Preparing for HE/SA master's programs,"Around the time I finished undergrad, I realized that a) I didn't want to do a PhD in my field and b) I'm interested in student affairs (primarily academic advising). Therefore, I have a pretty good sense of what PhD programs care about, but I now need to figure out what HE/SA programs are looking for in an applicant, partly for me and partly for the sake of future recommenders. 

For example, in PhD applications, letters of recommendation are a big factor, and programs want to see letters that vouch for your strong intrinsic motivation and potential to do scholarly research. I know my undergrad advisor could attest to those things, but would HE/SA programs care? I assume research potential isn't important if you're not aiming for a research degree or a research career. My advisor is likely not very familiar with what HE/SA programs want to know about. Is there some kind of advice or how-to sheet I could give my letter-writers if they want it? (Something like [this](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Grad-School-Recos/) but for HE/SA.) Or are LoRs not a big deal in this field?

And for me, what is an ideal number of years of relevant work experience? People on Grad Cafe say a two-year master's program is better if you're thin on experience, but how thin is thin? How long should you have worked if you're interested in a one-year program? (I'd be happy to do two years in principle, but some programs I really like for other reasons are one year.) I'm not planning to apply for at least a year or two, or more if that's advisable.

There are quite a few ""how to get into grad school"" books for other types of grad school, but I haven't found any that deal with HE/SA programs. Any recommendations?

Besides GPA, GRE, SoP, LoRs, and work experience, is there anything else important I should know about? Is volunteer experience a big deal in this field? And if so, how directly relevant to HE/SA does the experience need to be for admissions committees to care?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

Working in SA/HE as an international student in the US?,"How likely are international students getting sponsored to work in SA?

I just graduated in May and had decided to never to go back to school again. But, things changed, and I felt my passion to help low-income students through education grow stronger recently as I thought about my future.

I'm thinking of going back to school to get a master's (in SA/HE/EdLeadership), but I'm not sure of my prospect of getting a job in US colleges later as an international student. I got a bachelor's in liberal arts with no internship experience and have experienced the difficulty of getting a job of my interest already, so I don't want to experience the same thing again. .. I want to make sure that now I'm making informed decisions...

Being a low-income first generation without much support in term of career path in college makes me want to help first-gens even more but the reality is that if this is not a right decision, I would be a step backward and am already in crippling student debt"

From student to professional,"Hi everyone! 
First of all I would like to apologise for the mistakes I will commit in my writing. I'm spanish... :)

I am in an Animation and Video Game University and I am worried about the quality of my work. The topic can be aplied (I think) to most of the works but my case is easy to explain. 

I am not good enough yet to be a professional (I am in 2nd year) but some of my classmates are much better than me and I think they could already be hired in any company. I know that there are 2 years left but I don't think I will reach the requiered level I see in professional works. 

The thing is that I don't know how the professional world is. I don't know if, when you get hired, they provide you with some kind of training for you to reach a good level... I guess I am not the only one that will end the university with lower level than the requiered one so... 

Am I condemned to be always a bad artist?"
Advice and Input for graduate school,"Hey all! I am back and I have made a decision on where I am attending grad school. I have decided to attend my alma mater at James Madison Univeristy for their College Student Personnel Administration program, which is a counseling based program.

As I am gearing up for school I am thinking about the expereince I would like to have in school. My first assistantship with be in leadership education within the Leadership Center on campus. I am also planning out two practicums I would want to do and whaty second assistantship would look like. 

Reflecting on myself and my capabilities and interests, I would be interested in the following areas:

1. TRiO & Higher Education Oportunity/Summer Bridge Programs
2. Academic Advising
3.First-Year Experience (Not New Student Orientation although the two intersect at times)
4. Disability Services and Career Services/Development
6.Enrollment Management (Student Success & Retention)

Really and truly 1. through 3. are ones I could see myself in in the near future.

I was wondering if any of you all would have advice about any of these functional areas? What are some good organizations to check out and literature upon these functional areas? Also if you have any other advice that would be helpful as well!

Gateways to University,Hi made a throwaway for this and don't know if this is the right place to post this but I need advice. I'm 18 now in the UK. Got fair GCSE results B's and C's and went onto A level's which went abysmally with 2 U's and an E. So I'm about to finish a year of doing BTEC and this isn't looking good to me either. I want to go to university on a training course to become ODP (operating department practitioner) but I can't get on the course with the bad grades I've had and the general bad experience with education so far. What can I do next to get to university? Or should I move on and try and get a full time job? Before going onto anything else I am going to finish this course and see what I get from it. If this is in the wrong subreddit could someone please direct me to somewhere more appropriate for it. Thanks in advance.
Cheating on a test?,"An instructor hands out a take-home exam and claims that the text is open-book and open-internet (the only rule is no communicating with others students).

Does open-internet mean anything you find on the internet?  "
I feel as though some of my rights were violated by my school. Where can I seek answers to my questions?,"As the title indicates, I feel as though the school that I attend violated some very basic rights, namely, my right to privacy.

I feel like a doormat that anyone can walk all over without any fear of repercussion and it makes me feel very small and weak when all I ever intended was to go to school, work hard and earn a degree.

Thanks so much.

Should I report him or man up?,"So, I'll spare the details and get to the point. I recently failed a class and after talking to a professor, he directed me to the department head to see my options. Needless to say, this guy was rude and somewhat demeaning. Now this wouldn't be a problem, but over the course of our 15-20 minute conversation, he not only told me that I probably shouldn't be within the major I'm aiming for, but he also felt the need to tell me he'll get me blacklisted at every uni in the state for telling anyone any different then exactly what he was telling me. This was also accompanied by him feeling the need to explain why the class was necessary and that it basically wasn't his problem to fix.

I thought about reporting him to Student Affairs, but I figured I just needed to grow a pair and deal. But, apparently he's been acting this way towards many students, even going so far to deny entry to specific classes on a whim, with little to no explanation. So, now it feels like reporting him might be the right thing to do, but I'm not sure."

Appeal Critique,"Hi everyone. I messed up and got dismissed from my program at University. I need help with my appeal and would appreciate if people could provide some input on mine. Thank you!!

&#x200B;

Dear XXX,

I am writing this letter to appeal my academic dismissal from XXX program. Although I am not surprised by the decision, I am extremely upset to receive the letter of dismissal earlier this week informing me of this news. I am writing this letter with hope that I can still continue my journey in the Doctor of Pharmacy program. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to this decision. 

&#x200B;

This past year, I admit that I had a very difficult time and my grades have greatly suffered as a result. I went into my second year not knowing about the difficulty of all the classes I was registered in. Looking back, I realized I tried to balance too much this past year. I worked many hours at my job to be able to pay for tuition, rent, and necessities like groceries. The number of hours I worked cut into the time I had to study. I also tried to stay involved in extracurricular activities, such as clubs. Overall, my workload was too much for me to handle. I realize that I should have spoken to more people for support. In regard to balancing my schedule, I understand now that I should have made appointments with CASE more often to discuss how I should balance my schedule. I acknowledge and take full responsibility for what I previously stated, but I am taking all the steps I can in order to achieve the future I want. 

&#x200B;

I have fallen in love with XXX University and all that it has to offer, and it would mean the world to me to be able to continue to pursue my XXX degree. If I am given the opportunity, I will most importantly focus more on my schoolwork, work fewer hours, and manage my time more wisely. In order to improve my academic performance, I anticipate achieving the following:

&#x200B;

1.	Improvement Recognition: I have improved my grades from Fall 2018 by focusing harder and working smarter in Spring 2019. My GPA has increased by 0.203, an 8.9% increase. Given the chance, I surely know that I will be able to achieve this again. I have certainly worked harder in the last portion of the spring semester, and I will attach a conversation I had with Professor XXX that shows my improvement in my work habits. I would continue this academic growth into and throughout my professional years with the use of tutors and more hours dedicated to studying.

&#x200B;

2.	Additional Help/Resources:  I will continue to seek the help from my peer advisors, supervisors, tutors and attend “after hours” sessions. Historically, I have sought the guidance from XXX for Organic Chemistry I. I attended four of her Supplemental Instruction sessions and it helped me tremendously. Specifically, she helped me understand addition reactions, substitution and elimination, and many more concepts. After attending these sessions, I received a higher score on my final exam compared to previous exams. To continue this momentum, I will also seek a tutor for the more challenging classes I will undertake such as Organic Chemistry II.

&#x200B;

In addition, I frequently communicate and visit with my advisor, XXX, and discuss with her how to jumpstart my path to success in the future. I also plan on visiting Dean XXX for advice and guidance. I have recently emailed him to schedule days we can meet and chat about my future success. Since I am a first-generation student, I felt I did not have someone close to help guide me, but taking advantage of using faculty as mentors to assist me has pushed me in the right direction

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3.	Summer Course Enrollment: I will be taking Organic Chemistry II and retaking Medical Microbiology. If I am given the opportunity to take these classes, I will definitely be able to obtain the 2.7 GPA requirement. I have proven my success through summer courses, as last year I was in a similar situation. I wanted to improve my GPA; therefore, I retook Introduction to Psychology. I received a C+ during Spring 2018. When I retook the course during Summer 2018, I received an A which improved my GPA by 0.113, a 4.2% increase.

&#x200B;

In addition, I plan on working during the summer to help save money. This leads me to my payment plan.

&#x200B;

4.	New Tuition Payment Plan: I discussed a more strategic payment plan with my family that will allow me to still afford tuition at XXX while also allowing me to allocate more of my schedule to my schoolwork and less of my schedule to external work. By lifting some of the financial burden from my plate, I can dedicate my time and efforts towards my academic goals.

&#x200B;

Although my grades have not yet shown it, I truly am a good student that had a very difficult year juggling my financial and academic commitments. I hope I will be able to receive the opportunity for a second chance. These years are not just about learning academically, but learning about oneself, and growing as an adult. This experience has helped me see that. Thank you again for considering my appeal, and I sincerely hope to continue the path to my XXX degree with your approval.

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

XXX"
