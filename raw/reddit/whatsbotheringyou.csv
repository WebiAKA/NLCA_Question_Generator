I was raped and I don't know to fix it.,"I recently went away on a family holiday. My cousin and I decided to go out for the night just the 2 of us. Everything was going great and we had a nice catch up as I hadn't heard much from her since I've been away at Uni. She was very drunk but I'm used to dealing with that so it didn't matter. I wasn't drinking as I've been having trouble with my breathing and didn't wanna be drunk when an attack came on in case I couldn't sort myself out. Again, not a problem.

My cousin is single and so did meet a few guys throughout the night, however I have a boyfriend so when she was making out with a guy I'd usually just talk to his friend or someone nearby and met plenty of lovely guys and girls. Until 2 guys came over to talk to us. She immediately got off with one of them and I was left talking to the other. He seemed nice enough and I told him about my boyfriend, he had just gotten out of a relationship, told him about my new flat, he had just started renovating his own, told him about my pets etc etc. 

Then my cousin decided she wanted to move on, but they followed us to the club and the guy my cousin was with insisted on buying her drink - he then asked me what I would like. I've always been very cautious about people buying my drinks but since I was only drinking water - what could go wrong? When I saw that vodka and redbull was being poured for me as well I turned to point it out to my cousin and she just shrugged it off and said it was probably easier to order the same for everyone. I agreed and thought one drink isn't going to mean I won't be able to pull myself together if my breathing fucks up. 

From then it's a blur. I remember a brief moment of waking up and I was in a hotel room and this man was on top of me. It was the most horrible feeling. Like my brain was working but my body wasn't. I couldn't feel anything happening to me but I just know something did. I attempted to move to push him off but I couldn't control myself and my arms flopped to my side and I was out again. I was woken up by my cousin around 9am, still feeling rough. I didn't know where I was. There was a man sleeping in the corner and the main door was open for some reason. We some how managed to run and I don't remember how we got to the cab but my cousin told me we went to reception to ask for one. It was all still a bit hazy and so we didn't think to look at the hotel and the room number. 

Eventually we pulled up at the villa. We both felt sick, numb, ashamed and just decided we didn't want to tell anyone. Everyone assumed we just had a crazy night out and we left it at that. The last 3 days of the holiday it wasn't spoken about at all.

As soon as I got back home I broke down to my boyfriend and told him happened. He's still the only one I've told. But I feel like a horrible person. I've only ever been with 2 people both of whom I was in a long term relationship with - 1 being my current boyfriend. And I was always proud of that, but now I've had it forced upon me and that's ruined it. I feel angry and dirty. I feel numb, embarrassed, just so horrible that I accepted that one drink despite it not being what i asked for, and now my boyfriend isn't the only one I've been with in this relationship. 

I haven't left the house yet and my boyfriend works full time so I've been alone a fair bit. I keep just breaking down wherever I am in the flat and drop to the floor crying, until I remember I'm not that weak anymore and manage to pick myself up. But this is just a cycle and it's not fixing anything. I don't know what to do. For myself or my boyfriend. He needs help as much as I do and whilst i have him to comfort me and tell me it will all be okay, that doesn't work for him and I don't know what to do.

This is the first time I've told every little detail I remember and how I felt and I just think I needed to get it off my chest. Hopefully it will help in some small way."
Today marks 4 years.,"Today marks 4 years since my 6 month old son passed away, and not one person in my family could be bothered to call me. My step monster didn’t even acknowledge today. Not a “thinking about you” not even a fucking like on my Facebook status. My mother didn’t even text me, but she sure as shit made a Facebook post about it to garner sympathy from her boomer friends who think likes and prayers solve everything."
2 years of hard about to be meaningless due to going blind 3 years ago...,"&#x200B;

Went blind three years ago -- nothing disease related, simply fell and hit my head in the wrong spot.

&#x200B;

Been typing software code since I was 8 years old and all of 3 feet tall, and damn good at it.  Spent the last 2+ years after going blind on a new open source PHP based software platform at [https://apex-platform.org/](https://apex-platform.org/).

&#x200B;

I'm sorry, but that code is solid.  Even the harshest critics on the internet I can find can't really say anything bad about it anymore.  I know software, and this is good code, and a good system.

&#x200B;

The one criticism I get though is the website looks like crap, and due to not being able to see the screen, I can't fix that myself.  Did previously manage to make and sepnd $1200 USD on a designer, but got screwed.  For the life of me I am unable to find work -- freelance, contract, short-term, long-term, nothing.  

&#x200B;

The only thing I really have to showcase potentials these days is Apex, but when the site looks like crap, it makes no difference as to how solid the code is, people will just click off within 10 seconds and move on with their day.  It's beyond frustrating to know that 2+ years of hard work, and a quality system that could actually help loads of people out there, may all go down the tubes as nothing due to some design flaws that I could easily fix myself in a few hours if I could see again.

&#x200B;

Without that though, I'm pretty much a sitting duck.  I can't find work, can't get anyone to actually take an interest in Apex, and the main obstacle seems to simply be the design.  Or at least the feedback I'm hearing from others."
Girlfriend of Last 5 Years Passed Away,"Hello everyone. Long time reddit user here, first time posting. So I'm sure the title pretty much explains everything, but I'll try and give a backstory that isn't too lengthy, or gives our personalities away.

So I met my girlfriend (ex?) my freshman year of college. Both of us were involved with other people at the start of college, but our paths crossed and started dating Junior year of college. We're both involved in the performing arts and I've been working shows here in NYC and throughout the country, and she's been singing on cruise ships. Long story short, we both said that we would make our relationship work as best as can while we're away from each other. It worked....magically. Both of us were working in our fields of work, but unfortunately away from each other. She got offered the last ship she hadn't worked on, which would've meant she would've traveled to every continent, and practically everywhere worth visiting.

I told her not to go to the last ship in hopes of starting things earlier, but of course I wasn't going to prevent her from seeing the world. We both agreed on holding until September of 2013, where we would move in with each other and both promise that we'd both work in NYC. Unfortunately, she passed away within the first month of working her last contract. This happened 6 months ago, and they still have no idea what was the cause of death (they've ruled out suspicious activity, and are leaning towards natural causes.....she was 24 years old and perfectly healthy).

Fast forward some, it's been 6 months, her birthday is.....very soon, and we're drawing nearer to the date where we were supposed to move in.

I'm very lucky and have had ZERO experiences of anything remotely like this happen (both of extremity, and dealing with death). I guess what's I'm throwing out there is....

Is there anyone out there that has dealt with something remotely close to this? I don't want to get into specific details in the intro, but god damn.....this is just ridiculous, especially with her having passed at 24, and me being 26.

Has anyone out there dealt with a similar situation? I've went to therapy twice and pretty much thought it was a waste of time, and was very open to my thoughts and my 'ideology' on therapist sessions. This was during the second month, and I'm going on Wednesday for the first time since then. Love you guys and everyone who has to read this, thank you.

That most guys on Reddit refuse to accept that sexism against women is a problem.,"Almost every time I or someone else mentions anything along the idea that in today's society women are still treated as lesser than men, or have it worse than men, the comment is down voted and has some guy talking about one of the problems men face. This is something I have thought about for countless hours and is very important to me. I'm not some crazy SJW, I don't think men are evil or should be treated as lesser to women, and I don't deny that there are some struggles that men have to face. But this idea most guys on this site have that just because there are some problems that men face that women don't means that men have it just as bad as women seriously bothers me. It bothers me even more that when someone on this site does try and voice the opinion that women do have it harder, they are ridiculed for it. I thought this was a place where different ideas where accepted or at least respected. I do have so much more to say but I'd rather not write a wall of text."
Feeling very alone and abandoned,"I feel very depressed and alone at the moment. I put a lot of pressure on myself to do things and I always think I'm never good enough to accomplish things. Because of this, I surround myself with people who boost my mood and make me feel good, which helps me accomplish more things. After I graduated last year my mom decided she was going to move across states leaving my dad, brother, and sister. This was not a surprise, it has been talked about for years but I never actually thought she would go through with it. My mom and I travel to FL where she finds a house. I go back home (mom stayed in FL to close the deal) and it hit me like a rock. So I started feeling depressed and leaned on my friends/SO for support. I never told them that I needed their support because I didn't want them to feel obligated into helping me. I also didn't want to tell my mom that I was depressed about her moving because her and my dad were so happy to be away from each other. Long story short I find out my best friend is leaving to move in with a guy she's been dating for only less than a month, my SO is moving about an hour away to be closer to school, and my sister just left and moved in with her SO. The house is completely empty most of the time when it use to be filled with life. It's left me feeling abandoned and alone, new feelings I'm not use to dealing with and I don't know what I can do to make myself feel better. Any words of advice would be very helpful. 

Edit: Wow! Did not expect this many responses, thank you!"
Got drunk and acted very unlike myself with a girl I had just met. I feel like a piece of shit.,"I was at my friend's house for the first time and got to meet all of his friends.  It was a party and we all got more and more drunk as the night progressed.  I recently (about a month ago) broke up with my girlfriend and haven't really talked to any girls since.  I ended up getting drunk, and the girls (who I have never met, and will never see again) all seemed so hot and attractive, and a majority of them seemed interested in me.  Late in the night, one of the girls sort of backed into me and started grinding on me, and I was totally for it.  From then on we started making out and stuff, and I got really touchy feely.  I was groping her ass pretty much nonstop and I started thinking about sleeping with her.  Soon, everyone at the party starting warning me about her, telling me she has herpes and stuff like that, so I (thankfully) decide to not sleep with her.  She goes upstairs and ends up passing out on one of the beds, and me and some of my friend's friends find her a little while later.  We kind of try to wake her up, and one of the guys slaps the girls ass a few times (she wasn't moving, she was totally knocked out)  I checked to make sure she was still breathing, she was, and after the guys left me and her in the room and I ended up kind of groping her some more (she had her jeans on and everything) even though she was passed out.  My drunk logic had me thinking it was okay because she was fine with me doing it to her when she was awake.  The next morning she was still totally into me and was like touching me and messing with my hair and everything, but as I slowly recollected everything that happened and how I acted with her, I felt worse and worse.  I always try to treat women with respect and I look back at my actions that night in complete horror.  It was like someone else had taken over me.  It might have something to do with being recently single, but still... it makes me not want to drink again if I turn into some kind of monster.  :(

ALSO:  With a little facebook stalking, I found out today that she has a boyfriend.  Even though I didn't know that at the time, that makes me feel like even more of a scumbag for making out with someone and touching someone who is in a relationship.  Urgh"
"I let my fiancee down. She needed me, and I didn't realize how badly, and now she's gone.","Truly gone. She didn't dump me. I didn't get home to find all her shit packed away. I found her hanging by the neck from an extension cord from a tree branch in the back yard. 

 I didn't mean to ever let her feel alone, even for a moment. But I fucked it up. I didn't say what I should have said. I thought she'd sleep it off and that would be that. "
I'm terrified. COVID-19 is officially at my mom's work. My dad isn't healthy.,"My mom works in an ER in a major metropolitan area that has the busiest airport in the world.

She text me this morning that they're asking everyone about any respiratory symptoms and checking everyone's temperature before allowing anyone to come inside. When she got to her desk, she found an e-mail from some higher up saying that two patients had tested positive for COVID-19 at her hospital, which is why they're doing this now.

My mom, I'm not worried about. She's a 50s, healthy, adult. She may get sick, but I don't foresee her having severe complications. However, my dad is a 50s, unhealthy, obese adult with right side heart failure and lung disease.

My mom is doing everything she can to prevent spreading anything, but you can only do so much. They share a bed, you know?

I'm sick to my stomach about this. Like, can't focus, scared shitless, feeling helpless, and terrified.

Just needed to vent... Thought it'd help me be able to focus on my work if I could get this out."
I’m probably never going back to high school before I graduate... thanks COVID-19,"Hello, I’m normally not one to complain about what’s going on in my life on a subreddit, but this quarantine is really messing with me lol

I’m a senior in high school and tomorrow my state is going to announce the fate of public schools. I have a feeling that I’m not going to return to school and that really bothers me for some reason. I hate my school, I don’t really like a lot of the people who go to my school, and I don’t have too many friends, but for some reason I feel sad. I never got to say goodbye. I left my school a week ago, completely oblivious to the fact how that could be my last day there. I never got to say goodbye to teachers and some friends I only keep contact with there. AND graduation could not only be delayed, but cancelled. I know COVID-19 is very serious and keeps getting worse and worse, but I just wish I had at least 1 week... heck 1 more day of school just to say my farewell to people and the building before I start my new life as a college student (if the virus doesn’t ruin that too)

I know there are soooo many other things to worry about in this world and this just sounds pathetic but I just felt like letting this out.

Anyone out there in this situation and feeling the same way? 

WASH YOUR HANDS!!"
"Overheard two coworkers spouting anti-vax BS, I wanted to go off on them but didn’t. It makes me so angry that people would spread lies like that.","One told the other that she “read that some guy got paralyzed after getting the MMR vaccine, I will NEVER vaccinate my kids. The propaganda you see about vaccines is ridiculous, it’s all them wanting to make money”.

This was from a woman in her 40’s with two kids. The other agreed."
"So, my mom died.","I have been stalking reddit for about 4 months now, and I cannot express how much it has meant to me in that time. I've never posted, but the presence of this community has been SO important to me recently! As I said, I've been lurking around for 4 months... but 3 months ago my mom died.

It was really, really sudden and unexpected. She was 64 and in pretty good health. We spoke every day - about EVERYthing, just shooting the shit for ages, but also about things that were important to her and to me. Then one day, I went to my night class (I'm getting my MA) and was annoyed to get a phone call from her and answered in a pissy way. It was her friend calling from her home phone saying she was in the hospital. I felt sick with dread, but then talked to her several times, and long story short, no big deal - she had gallstones and they'd take them out in the morning.

 Again, looooong story short, she ended up dying in the very early morning from a heart attack, which is exactly what she thought was the problem when she went to the hospital in the first place. 

 That was May 8. Today is August 8. It's been 3 months. I feel absolutely horrible, and my life is TOTALLY in a completely effed up state - I have been to court 3x, have evicted a guy, am dealing with greedy family (I'm an only child - these are cousins), am renovating a house, have moved apartments in my city, have taken an intensive class for my MA, and have been the executor of her estate after a long battle to even get here. 

If you've read this wall of text, thank you. But honestly, what's bothering me is that it's 3 months to the day later, and she was my best best and most close friend, and she listened to everything I ever had to say, and yet, while I feel like I miss her, I don't feel like I've mourned her at all, and I don't see myself ever being able to.

 I feel like I'm doing her a disservice by not crying about her death much much more (I have cried, but not as much as, say, my breakup from my live-in boyfriend of 3 years, which makes me think WHAT THE FUCK is wrong with my priorities?!). I KNOW she loved me more than anything, and I hope she knew that I felt the same way about her, but I am bothered by the fact that maybe no one else would know that by looking at me. 

Thank you for reading, I love this place.

I could be done for sexual assault at 16 for a ridiculous reason.,"I'm sitting here typing this in my principals (he's left to go do something) office both shocked and baffled by my current situation. So yesterday my schools rugby team defeated a rival schools team to knock them out of a cup, after which we left the ground we saw many rival supporters who we began jeering as we'd just won. Through our jeering this enraged them
and they began both spitting and bashing the windows of our bus furiously as we continued to anger them. In the heat of the moment I decided to moon a massive crowd of their supporters as the bus began to pull off. So today I'm called into my principals office and told that one of the students is filing for 'visual assault' and trauma. Sorry what? So because of a bit of banter after a match I could potentially go on Ireland's sexual offenders list at 16? I'm both in tears and shock and anger at this and I don't know how to handle this. "
I'm not getting enough done.,"I'm not in this sub to wave my e-dick around, but this is all relevant to where I'm at, and what's bothering me: I'm 21 years old, have an engaging, and reasonably well-paying (Almost 40K/year) job. My co-workers are absolute fucking geniuses, and I learn new things every day relevant to a field I could see myself pursuing a career in. There's probably good growth for me here if I want to stick around.

I go to the gym 4 times a week, and have recently started seeing ""real"" results. This fills me with pride that is hard to compare to anything I've felt before in my life. Like every other redditor in the world, I think I'm a pretty sharp dude, but have a bit of trouble applying myself. I feel like I've gotten to where I am by doing nothing but making the obvious choices, and ""showing up"". I don't feel like any of it is a real accomplishment, because it all sort of just fell into my lap. I'm somewhat good with words, and presenting myself in a positive light, so I usually ace interviews, but other than that I just arrive on time, and do my job well. I'll go the extra mile if a manager will notice, but I'm not the guy who is working overtime for the sake of making a deadline a week early.

I have passions, and hobbies. I get paid to play music at a local venue on the weekends. I've been doing swing dancing for a few years, and I'm pretty cool with the guys down at the local bar.

I have a small, but rock solid group of friends who have my back on nearly anything, no questions asked.

In comparison to a good amount of people my age, I'm doing great. I have friends who are still pumping minimum wage at McDonalds, so they can afford their drug habits. I have friends who just graduated college, and are now deep in debt, and unable to find a job. On paper, I'm doing ""better"" than they are. I am setting the groundwork to lead a prosperous, successful life.

I always come back to the same question, though: Is it enough? It's hard to find any answer other than ominous, sigh-accompanied ""No."". I feel like I'm a big fish in a small pond. Is my success only valid because the bar is so low? Why am I not doing more? Tonight isn't gym night. I'll probably go home, cook dinner read for a little, play videogames for an hour or so, then hit the hay, so I can wake up well-rested for my challenging job. Why? Why am I not using that time to take those college classes I've been putting off forever? Ah... Because then I would have no social life, and I can't waste my twenties ONLY doing productive things, because then I might look back at these years with regret.

College comes to mind as well. I've never been. Steve Jobs never went though, right? Neither did Bill Gates (Or at least I read that on the internet, and decided not to research it because it makes me feel less insecure about the whole thing). I genuinely think that with my job experience (Been working since I turned 14. 3 years at my first job, little bit of management experience. SOLID Resume for someone my age, other than my lack of college), I could probably find a nice comfy spot making a good wage, and live the standard happy life. Hell, maybe I could even be an entrepreneur! I'm a pretty smart dude. With all that said, I still worry about it almost every day. What if I need that diploma to get where I want to go, and I'm ""wasting"" a small portion of my free time for the sake of base pleasure. Alternatively, what if I don't need it, and I waste years of valuable time, and money, to get it?

Anyway, I'm not here looking for answers, because I guess it all comes back to opinion, and figuring out what's important to you. I'm here because I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been where I am right now, and It'd be killer to hear some feedback, or just another viewpoint on the whole thing. Thanks."

I miss having Sex. I miss being in love.,"This year my ex girlfriend broke up with me. This was roughly 2 months ago and ever since then, we had very little contact due to the circumstances at hand.

By now, I realised that this was a veery unhealthy relationship since she really used me and did me more harm than love most of the time.
It was hard for me, but as of right now, I would not return to her.

Just today I had a thought, I don't know why.
I had a picture of how we had sex. Everything about it. How we kissed. Her breasts shaking. How I kissed her neck and we kissed each other and said how much we love each other.

I don't just miss the feeling of orgasming to another person, but also miss being with someone. Loving someone.

I am male and 20 and will probably find someone else in the future. But as of right now. I really miss hugging my loved one, waking up to her and talking dirty to each other as well as surprising the other."
My girlfriend is cheating on me (She 100% IS NOT cheating on me),"Hello,

Some background: I'm 24 and and in my first relationship (ever) with a girl I've reconnected with from high school. We've only been dating for around 7 months but it's a serious relationship, we both say we love each other. 

I want to spend every minute free I have with her, I want to be with her forever and I love her with all my heart, and as far as I can tell, she wants basically the same thing. I think I'm a bit more into her than she is into me but I may just be overthinking it. 

ANYWAYS, I have a problem. I constantly feel like she's either cheating on me, or talking to other people behind my back, or just not that into me at all. I'm always worried like she's going to break up or cheat on me or that she already has.

Of course she is not cheating on me, she is so sincere and kind and I know she really likes me, but I just can't shake this pervasive feeling of being jealous and untrusting of her. Is this normal for a relationship? I haven't told her that I feel this way obviously and I certainly don't control her, she is free to do/talk to whatever she likes. I really want to not be like this, whenever we're together we go hand in hand but when we're apart it physically pains me (I feel SUPER anxious) that I'm not with her in addition to the fact that I feel extremely jealous. What can I do to make myself feel better?

Thank you for reading, I love this subreddit everyone here is so kind and caring. You're all easily one of the best subreddits."
"My parents judge and make fun of me because I'm a ""prude""","I'm a 19 year old girl. I've never had a boyfriend, though not by choice, and I'm a virgin. I don't drink often because I get sick after two beers and it's not worth it to me. I don't smoke pot because I don't like the smell and I don't like the way some people act when high. For some reason, my parents want me to change these lifestyle choices and make fun of me for them. 

I guess I should start off by saying both my parents like to party. They drink on a daily basis, though they don't always get drunk, and they both smoke pot. They have been bothering me about this for a while, but tonight at a New Year's Eve party it really just pushed me over the edge.

First my mom and her friend, who were drunk, started asking be inappropriate sexual questions in front of other people, mostly men and one of them being my father. They told me that if I don't drink I should at least get high. They were also telling me that if I don't lose my virginity by the time I'm 21 then I'm a loser. Then they started asking me if I would at least do oral sex, and if I know how to orgasm, etc etc. I finally got too embarrassed and left. 

I went home next door and overheard my father talking shit about me. We're planning a trip to Vegas, and he was saying that I need to stay home because I'll drag everyone else down because I'm a stick in the mud. 

There's been more instances like this but this one just happened so that's why I'm sharing it. I guess I just don't understand why they're so judgmental. While I am a little boring, I feel like the choices I'm making are generally positive and something normal parents would be proud of. I plan on talking to them about it tomorrow but I don't really know what to say :/ Anyways, thanks for listening/reading.

I hate eating and wish it wasn't a laborious chore,"I find it surprising as heck that I couldn't find a single relevant post on the Internet about my problem. So I had to post about it. 

The very few posts I did manage to find where someone felt this way always received the same canned response unfortunately. ""You must have an eating disorder and you should speak to a therapist/doctor."" I don't think anything is wrong with me. I just wish that I could take a nutrition pill so I didn't have to waste time cooking and eating. Unfortunately, that isn't possible so I wish I could figure out how to find pleasure in the process or how I could get by with cooking very infrequently - and when I do have to cook, doing it in a way that is quick, cheap, healthy and mindless. 

Hopefully this resonates with someone and has got a solution for me. Thanks for reading and I appreciate any ideas!"
The CDC has known about this virus for more than two months. Where the fuck are the test kits?,"Why the fuck do we have half the tests performed than South Korea? Why the hell are our elected officials not making this top priority? I am on my fourth day of chest pain and a cough, too minor to have any chance of getting tested according to the ""you have to be THIS close to dead"" guidelines. I just want to know as if I'm going to be immune as it means I can be on the front lines helping. And I want others to know so that we can actually contain it like South Korea and that town in Italy did.

We get no idea to a timeline to get this done at Trump's press conferences. We have no idea if we can ever roll them out. How is this acceptable? How can our leadership at the state and federal level not spend every ounce of energy ensuring that this happens? Call every testing expert in the country and get them to team up with any person who can replicate whatever the protocol is to create the test. We have universities, national labs, industry labs, all shut down that can certainly do such an assay. I've read paper after paper where people have established protocols to do the labwork [on one's phone](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/02/lab-chip-turns-smart-phones-mobile-disease-clinics) for disease identification; shouldn't that be a top priority for generating an efficient test for this virus? Shouldn't there be talks with hardware manufacturers to see this is done ASAP? Fucking hell. What the fuck are we doing?"
I've been with my wife for 9 years today.,"Me and my wife have been together 9 years today. Married for a little over 2 years.

I'm moving out in 2 weeks.

She has agreed to go to marriage counseling with me after 8 months of me wanting her to go.

At this point I don't know what is left to save. She has prioritized her job and her friends over our marriage.

She hasn't spent more than a few nights in a row at home in the last 4 months. When I ask her if there is someone else she makes me feel like I am dick for not trusting her. The truth is I don't think she is cheating on me but I do believe she is having an affair with one of her girl friends. You don't spend this much time with someone if they don't mean something to you. She certainly hasn't spent as much time with me for the last couple years as she is spending with this friend. She went on 4 or 5 trips out of town. Went a lot of places I have wanted to take my wife for the last year but there was always to much work to go.

She cancelled the trip I had planned for my birthday in February to a city I really wanted to go to be aide of work. Then up and went there with her friend for 5 days on whim this summer. Only letting me know a couple days before they left. Then stayed for 3 days longer than she told me they were staying for. I just fucking swallowed it and didn't say anything.

Now that I'm speaking up and telling her how hurt and betrayed I'm feeling you think I'm just trying be a wet blanket.

Your able to go out and have fun and forget about me. I can't do that. This pain is killing me.

I don't know what magic fairy dust you think a marriage counselor is going to sprinkle on us.

I never thought I'd say this but I can't wait to move out. It wasn't my idea and I told you what a mistake it was. Now I just want to get the fuck away from you. You hate everything about me and not being around can only help my self-esteem and creativity.

It fucking hurts more than anything I've ever felt before. Anything has to be better than this though.

I'm shocked by how much I miss human interaction,"I was living in my college dorm with five other guys but moved back home this academic term once the quarantine was set in place. I haven't really felt right these past few weeks, and it dawned upon me one day that my newly-founded depression was caused by the complete lack of social interaction. I genuinely miss seeing my suitemate's silhouette out my door because I knew they were there to bother me about video games, studying, getting dinner, getting girls, etc. I was always the introvert of the group because I usually relied on them to take initiative. I literally having to sneak out of my apartment by the end of the quarter because I was never allowed to eat by myself. I won't deny that they could be hella stupid sometimes, but the energy was great and it made my otherwise miserable life at college bearable.  


I've eaten breakfast, lunch, and dinner by myself for the past month now. As stupid as it is, I'm sad that there's nobody to call me a homosexual because I don't have a girlfriend or chase me down across half the campus on their boosted board because I've ""surpassed my quota"" for the number of times I can eat alone per week. I've had nobody but myself during this quarantine and I honestly wish for things to go back to the way they were.  


**tl;dr**: I always thought I was a major introvert but being separated from my hooligan suitemates due to quarantine has me questioning everything I knew. Reposting this cause I somehow managed to screw up the title"

This was the best year of my life.,"This is a selfish 'coronavirus is ruining my plans' post.

I finally moved away from home, moved to college. I escaped my broken home!!

I lived with and became really close with the coolest, most intelligent and motivated people i've known. This was my only year I was going to live with all of them in the dorms. I was doing good in school and I got an internship over summer! I was getting really close an awesome girl and was looking forward to spending the next 2 months living literally on the same floor as her, whether or not things ever escalated between us.

Now everything has fucked up. Because of coronavirus the rest of the academic year will be conducted online and we all have to move back home. I have to move back with my parents who hate me and somehow have to succeed in upper division engineering classes all online in an environment I really don't like.

Things were AWESOME. I was HAPPY. I've been happy before but I've never felt so fulfilled with life. Now it's all being taken away from me by powers out of my control. I'm mad that there's no one to blame and no one to be mad at, its just a quirk of biology doing its thing and we just happen to be collateral damage.

Oddly, the one comforting thing is that so many other people are also going through so much shit because of this stupid fucking virus. I know that sounds selfish but that's been helping me get through the days.

I just want to wake up tomorrow and have this all be a fever dream."
My government is being a total dick :/,"I just can't describe how bad I feel for living in this country anymore. It's getting more and more hellish every passing day.
Have you heared a country stuck between Europe and Middle East called Turkey?
Maybe you are familiar with Gezi Protests or June uprising last year.
Yes I was there. Tear gassed and water sprayed. I was beaten and taken into custody. I was abused and molested by the cops. It was both the best and worse times of my life.
Yeah that's where I am from. That's my own personal hell.
We recently had local elections. After 20 years of mayorship we wanted Ankara's (The capital) mayor to be gone. Just because he is a piece of shit. We voted. I waited infront of my ballot box just to make sure it's safe and no one does any monkey business. But guess what? Even though we know our candidate won, the election comitee announced the old mayor. We protested and  once again we were tear gassed and beaten. We demanded justice and once again we were teargassed. I don't know what to do anymore. 
I love this country because it's where I call home. But I can't live here. Not anymore. 
Fascism kills, man. Directly or indirectly. If the state violance won't kill me, I will end up killing myself.

Cheers to democracy we all fight for.

I don't think I can raise my son,"He's 9 months & the love of my life. I'm obsessed with him & him smiling is the best thing I have seen. But right now my father is dying of colon cancer, I live in his house and I don't know if I'll be able to keep it. I also work for his business & I don't know if I'll be able to keep the business going. Then, my son's father is leaving for good in a week which is both good & bad. 

I'm going to be alone. I have no other family who can help, my aunt already said she won't & my grandmother has Parkinsons and lives in another country. My friends all have lives of their own. 

I don't think I can take care of my son. His father has me so full of doubts. All I want to do is die because I'm so afraid of what's going to happen. I don't think I can do this alone. When I got pregnant everything was fine, my father was healthy the company was doing well, the father & I weren't good but we were working on it. I don't know what to do. All I'm doing now is crying because I'm so lost. I don't want to be alone! I don't think I can handle it. I love my father I want him to see his grandson turn 1. But that won't happen. I don't even know if I'll be able to see him turn 2 at this point I feel like such a failure."
My Dad,"I haven’t heard from my dad in over a year, he is homeless, family disowned him and he has a drug habit. With whats going on in the world right now I haven’t been able to get my mind off thinking about him and if he is okay. Im so worried and I cant stop crying because there’s nothing I can do. I wish I could call him. I wish he had a phone number. I love you daddy please be okay."
My brother is dying.... Alone....,"Warning - multiple f bombs.

My brother was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery to break up blood clots in his lungs.  That was Thursday.  Today is Monday. His wife, daughter and our parents have not been allowed into the hospital to see him. I'm 400 miles away and not supposed to travel so I can't be down there to support and grieve with my family, much less see my brother before he dies.  

He's getting progressively worse.  I'm expecting a call from my parents today telling me I no longer have a brother.

I am so **fucking** angry.  I have accepted that he will die in the next few years; his health has declined to the point that we all expected something like this was going to happen in the near future.  None of us expected to not be able to be with him when it does.

There are ZERO cases of the virus in that hospital.  They could very easily triage visitors the same way they are employees. But they won't. 

Because they are fucking heartless.  

**My brother is going to die alone in a fucking hospital because they won't let his family in to be by his side.**

But I can stop by Starbucks and get my fucking latte and then hit Mickey D's for a fucking value meal and then have a fucking pizza delivered.

This close to saying fuck everyone, I'm driving my ass down there and you WILL be letting my brothers wife and daughter in to see him or I WILL go completely ape shit right there in the parking lot.  Yeah, I'll end up in jail but the whole fucking world will know about it, cuz YouTube.  (note-I won't be doing it, but damn it feels good to type it). 

Thanks for reading this.  I hope your day is going much better than mine."
Tomorrow I will never see my cat again,"Tomorrow I have to say goodbye to my cat Felix. Never in my life have I bonded with an animal like I have with this cat. Right now I just want to sob and hold him close. He chose me as his owner and treats me so much differently that the rest of my family. Anyone can see just how much this cat likes me and I like him. He jumps into my arms and sleeps on my lap. But tomorrow I have to re-home him. It's a long story that some would disagree with, but my family is moving out of state this summer and I can't bring him with us no matter how much I want to. 

I'm just so upset and frankly angry. I know that in order to move (which will be so incredibly good for me and my family) we have to re-home him, but none of that makes this any easier. I just hope he's happy in his new home. I'm never going to see Felix again, and it's not fair. 

Why is loving an animal so hard sometimes?"
I'm not doing to well rn,"I was browsing Google and thought I'd look up ""the effects of beating children"" (I was beaten when I was younger and am still disciplined with it to this day I'm 15 btw) and the effects sound a lot like what my mindset and personality are like I can't fight I can't lift a hand to someone if someone hits me I'll sit there and take it I tend to bottle up my emotions and put others first even if it hurts my mother would often beat me if I did something wrong when I was younger and then try to smooth things out with motherly love it actually caused more pain and damage than it did healing and happiness I am also bullied a lot and belittled by my fellow students Ive been emotionally shut off for most of my life I've also faced abuse from the age of four up to six by a girl I looked up to I can't form attachments to people because my mind is set on the one rule Ive followed for a while ""they will hurt you."" I'm really just looking for a little bit of weight off my shoulders so if you read this thank you."
Test post.,Just testing this out. Looking forward to hearing some submissions.
My dog had cancer. I had to say goodbye to her today.,"My little pupster was only three and a half, she was the sweetest dog.  We only found out about the cancer two weeks ago.  We were told it was too late and there was nothing we could do but take her home and spoil her until her quality of life was too bad and it was time to let her go.  It was lung cancer and it happened so fast.  She started coughing and wheezing a few days before I took her into the vet.  By Monday she could hardly walk, she stopped eating and she couldn't barely hold down water.  Last night she cried all night and today I knew it would be cruel to let her be in any more pain.  

It doesn't feel real.  It happened so fast.  I called the vet this morning and told them she was in too much pain to go on.  My husband came home to stay with our boys.  I took her to the vets office.  They let us into a little quiet room with a comfortable couch and a soft rug on the floor.  It was very quiet.  I sat and cuddled her.  The vet gave her a shot and she fell asleep while I told her what a wonderful girl she was.  I wish I would have left then.  But I didn't want her to go without me there to hold her.  So I stayed and pet her while they gave her the second shot.  It was the worst thing in the world when she stopped breathing.

She was such a sweet girl and she should have had a much longer life.  I went home and tried to be a tough guy for my husband and our little boy.  But I keep getting hit with these waves of sadness.  It hurts and I miss her.  She was such a funny good sweet baby.  She loved camping.  She loved barbecues.  She loved loved loved car rides.  Even her last car ride.  She couldn't put her head out the window like she always did because she was too weak too.  But she wagged her tail the whole way.  

I can't talk it out at home.  The boys don't need mama falling apart and my husband is doing his best but he is taking it hard too.  We are just hugging a lot more then usual and being quiet.  Thank you for reading as I needed to get it out.  I miss her and it hurts that I will never pet her head again or hear her running through the house after the boys."
Being forced to have a baby and close to offing myself,"I'm 19 and i dislike children. DISLIKE. I get annoyed by the easily, I don't like interacting with them, I prefer to read quietly even as a child. I married my husband after I got kicked out by my parents at 18 for having a condom from a bachlerotte party they took me to.

I was so so so careful. I was starting my nuclear engineering degree, I had a 4.0 and I had an amazing boyfriend. When we got married, of course sex came with it. But we used both birth control pills and condoms. 

Apparently i got pregnant about a month after our wedding in March. I wanted to abort and my husband was supportive. He's an illegal immigrant and so is his entire family, but he has deferred action. So we live with his parents. It would have cost $400 dollars and a 400 mile round trip to do it, but i was willing. Then his parent's found out and cried and yelled and forbid it. All of the usual bullshit arguments of it's a baby and God bs.

So we decided to give it up for adoption. BUT NOPE! They won't let us do that either. More yelling, screaming, calling the idea heartless, selfish and heartless. My sister in law is pregnant and it's a girl. I'm 18 weeks in and it's a boy. They insisted on rubbing my belly and making stuff for it.

All I do is cry. I cringe when i fell it move. I cry when i think about my ruined future. I know my husband would do what he offered to make this right but they'd hate him. They act like a baby is a great thing. But i don't want to live in poverty like they do. I'm not religious like they are. I can't handle being a mom, i hate children and I already hate this unborn fetus. I don't smile when i see the sonograms, I pray for miscarriage. I think about all the different ways i can kill myself and It's taking a toll on my husband. 

He sees i'm upset and he feels like a failure. We were going to get an apartment but my job which paid 15.00/hr for working from home just told me there isn't work for a month or two. We have college to pay for and rent for a run down apartment is about $700 not including deposit. All the jobs here are minimum wage. My city has no mental health resources. I swear if they touch my belly or talk about how blessed I am, I will jump in front of a car.

I don't want this child, I don't want to live here anymore. Everyday I wake up in agony from knowing I will have to fake-smile my way through another day. This isn't even an easy pregnancy: I've been hospitalized twice. My blood work is awful. It's literally taking everything I have and no one cares. I feel so alone and ashamed. I was always taught to never have a child before 21. My friends are all going of to university and i'm stuck with my mom in law and her bible. I don't even speak their language. It hurts knowing I got into Embry-Riddle, Yale, Texas A&M and UT. It hurts knowing i'll be stuck in community college instead. I want to find an illegal abortion but with my job loss i don't have the money to do so. I've considered overdosing, hanging myself, drowning, ect. The only thing that stops me is my 6 week old kitten that meows and purrs when I cry.
I'm so miserable. My husband and I live in a tiny room with only a dresser and twin sized bed. His mother is nosy, she insists on going through the groceries I buy, the clothes i buy, and the medication I take. She won't let me do our laundry. I feel like a child. I'm starting to hate her. She was even against us moving out unless it was with her extended family. Her entire world is church and being a stay at home mom. All they talk about this baby and I'm so done. I can't be a mother.  I've written my suicide note out on MS Word. My husband is asleep next to me along with my kitten. Right now those are the only two things keeping me from grabbing the bottles of pills they prescribed me and overdosing. 

i'm afraid to talk to someone. I'm afraid my in-laws won't let me. I'm afraid they'll lock me up. I'm not crazy, Reddit. I'm just out of options. my future job needs a security clearance and no one is going to trust the therapist girl with nuclear reactors. I'm so done. I'm tired. All my energy is gone and I don't have the will to live. There are days where I spend hours looking up at nothing and silently crying. We don't have a proper bed: we sleep on foam and wood. We don't have a fan and it's 110. We don't have a car. I'm worried about even having enough to eat. This family already has 5 people, with my sister in laws kid next month it'll be 6. there's only 3 rooms. we can't add a 7th. I already pay the tv, water and cell phones for everyone. I just can't handle this anymore. I had everything planned, and it's all gone. I have nothing and my parents were right: I am a failure and a disgrace. "
"i feel like no matter how productive i'm being, i can't find satisfaction or ""self-solace"" for the lack of a better term. nothing feels right","i have multiple hobbies that pursue, and have been pursuing for years now. i work a fulltime job making $23.50 an hour and provide for my family and then some.

i'm 20 years of age and i feel stuck. stuck with my life situation and where and when i should go do things in life. my brain seemingly lacks the ability to be ""comfortably relaxed"" unjustifiable relaxation feels SOOO wasteful to me and maybe that's just how i am dunno. i feel really stupid writing this as this is biting into time that i could spend being productive. why am i here? sometimes my brain enters this super existential state wherein i feel nothing can be accomplished and everything i am currently doing, and all i am striving for is for naught and it'll never be tangible.

writing this out here regardless of whether or not anyone reads it will help me i think, just letting whatever feeling this is out into some sort of outlet. sorry if poorly formatted or if there are any typos present"
I'm terrified of how people are reacting to Asian people because of the coronavirus,"Jokes were bad enough to start with, but I've read a stories of awful things people are doing to completely healthy Asian people. It's not even in Asian countries, just people who are seen as Asian being attacked, harassed and bullied. I've read about a teenager being attacked by classmates, a man having a heart attack being refused help by any passersby and so many things that are honestly awful.

I'm only part Chinese, but I have a Chinese surname and without my glasses, look 'Asian' according to friends/family. I feel on edge whenever I hear someone mention the virus, or joke about it because even at my college I'm just waiting for someone to turn on me. I've stopped wearing contacts so my glasses cover my eyes and I honestly no longer feel safe talking to anyone about my Chinese family or heritage.

I know I'm overreacting, but the things people are doing make me sick. They just want an excuse for blatant racism and they're getting it. I don't want to be scared of everyone around me just because of a virus that has barely come anywhere near our country."
She sounded so happy to be going on her last walk.,"I thought there was a chance I wasn't going to be a wreck today. Finally nutted up enough to go to my initial therapy appointment last night, managed to admit out loud to another human being that I've been feeling suicidal. Come home, emotionally exhausted, to be told we're putting my childhood dog down today. 

She's old, arthritic, covered in sores, and miserable. It is her time. I just. god dammit. i was having enough trouble handling feelings as it was. i was even almost handling it okay until i heard her barking and excited to go on what would end up being her last walk. she didn't know it's her last walk. she was just happy.

i don't know how i'm going to finish work today. i don't. *fuck*."
Unused toothbrush,"Not sure how long this will turn out to be, I haven't slept and this has been on my mind all night.

I work on an Alzheimer's unit as a cna. We had an admission a couple nights ago, I never really met the guy because he was on the other section of the floor. As he had only been in for a few hours his wife didn't really know her way around and came over to my side with a toothbrush that she had just gotten him. because she was new and I had no reason to think she was a family member that would end up being a huge pain in the ass I figured I would help her out. At first i was just going to show her over to the other side but I figured ""hey I might as well help her out, it's better than passing trays."" so I showed her to the other side, and when we got there I helped her unbox this brand new toothbrush. So we opened it up, I attached the head for her and wrote the name on the toothbrush and the charging station. All the while she is jokingly pointing out that there's a travel case that he'll probably never use because he won't be going on any trips. I just smile and nod give a little chuckle and put it in his bathroom. I came in the next night and he had been sent out to the hospital. I'm not sure why exactly but one of the nurses told me that his labs were all out of whack and that his kidneys were failing. The whole night after that i couldn't stop thinking about this toothbrush he never used. It was hilarious. The irony was just so crazy to me. Out of everything it's this damn toothbrush that the guy never got to use. sitting there in his bathroom as he's passing away in the hospital. It made me realize more than anything that you never know what could happen to you. This might not be the right sub for this but not sure where else it could belong. live your life like it's about to end because you might not get to use that new toothbrush."
I feel abandoned by my own community.,"I'm a transsexual man. I've been out for the past 6 years and physically transitioning through hormones for the past 1.5 years. I was supposed to get a double-mastectomy done this summer but that's been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. My family has never been supportive of this and I'll never get any guidance from them through my transition, so I feel alone.

Initially I could talk to other transsexual people and ask for advice in how to talk to my family, get resources for therapists who specialize in the field as well as endocrinologists and surgeons. People were only ever supportive, understood the disconnect between my brain's sex and my body's sex (known as gender dysphoria) and there was nothing controversial about this being seen as a medical condition.

But now it's all wrong. It's become a bunch of these teenagers who base their ""gender identity"" solely on how they dress and what name they choose, and it has nothing to do with gender dysphoria. These people became the vocal minority, and then everyone else started agreeing and now saying that gender dysphoria is what makes someone trans is now a controversial statement. 

People are less interested in transition now and more interested in ""breaking the binary."" They're more interested in who has it harder, and if you ""pass"" as your desired sex, you're more privileged than people who don't ""pass."" They're more interested in tearing each other down rather than supporting each other. 

I'm struggling, I really am. People used to just want to transition, then get on with life and leave the ""trans"" part behind. For me it's so trivial. I dont introduce myself as being SomeRagingPacifist, 19, trans man. I assume people read me as male and that's all I care about. I dont out myself to anyone unless I need to. There's no need. 

But now you have to be proud about your identity or whatever, and being ""stealth"" is a privilege and you're abandoning trans people who aren't stealth. 

What about me? You abandoned me! I don't give a shit if you feel left behind anymore! Grow up. I used to feel supported, now I feel othered.

There's another community called r/truscum which supposedly holds beliefs similar to mine but damn, they are so fucking whiny sometimes that they're not worth my time either. 

I am not proud of my identity. I'm transitioning to male, and I wanted some support through that, but all I'm getting is bitchiness and polarization of opinions. I just want to transition and be done. I ideally wanted guidance along the way, guidance I can't get from my parents, but now that's too much to ask. I'll just do it alone."
Why do I feel guilty for wanting to find a better paying job?,As the title says I feel guilty and don't know why. I really like my current job and the people I work with but the pay isn't the best. I feel like everyone will think of me as a deserter that doesn't care about any of them or the business. The thought of going up to boss and bringing this up terrifies me and I know it shouldn't. This is normal thing that people do all the time but for whatever reason I can't seem to rationalize this to myself. Is it normal to have these feeling or am I just being really over the top right now?
I think I’ve wasted my life.,"I graduated with an undergraduate degree last May. I got my degree in Psych and planned on getting my masters. I have been working with kids with ASD and started my masters program in the fall. I thought this is what I wanted from life, but now I’m not sure. I waited to date until I was out of college and now it’s impossible. I’m so stressed out from work and school it has literally made me ill. I feel like I’m missing out on so much with my family, friends, and love life for what? To be stressed out and miserable my whole life? The problem is I don’t know what else I could/would do with my life. I just want to be happy with my choice and not regret my decisions years down the line."
I'm heading towards death and I'm not ready...,"My oldest son was recently married.  While the planning for the wedding felt like it went on forever, the wedding itself (and the entire weekend, for that matter) was over in a flash.  He and his new bride have ventured off to their new home town to start their lives.  We couldn't be more proud of them.  

Since they have left, a depression has set in.  Not for the loss of my son, but I'm realizing that I am indeed getting old.  

I live a very structured life.  I'm very process-oriented.  Everything has a place and all action have a set of instructions and logic to follow to ensure proper completion.  For me, it's necessary because I am very forgetful and misplace things all the time.  MY life requires Six Sigma.  I find illogical actions and ""drama"" highly annoying. 

Through life, I've always kept a mental scorecard of the order of how things should go.  
Birth, go to school, graduate elementary, middle, and high school, job, marry, kids, kids graduate and become adults, kids move out, kids marry, grandchildren, death. 

I'm reaching the end of my ""process"" and it scares me. I have a lot of energy left for life.  I appreciate every single passing moment.  But every moment that disappears comes with a keen understanding that it is lost forever, never to be experienced again.  Every sunset is another day gone by never to be had again.  

*I'm heading towards death and there isn't a single damned thing I can do about it.*

On one hand, this should prompt me to *ENJOY* these moments and get everything out of them I can.  But that nagging voice constantly reminds me and drags me down.  Is this a mid-life crisis?  Is therapy in order?  What am I to do?

**tl;dr - Life events cause depression, fear of death**



(EDIT - You guys are great.  You've given me positive feedback, hope, and a host of great ideas.  Hold your chin up because you helped someone today. Thank you so very much.  I have deep gratitude and promise to return the favor to someone else in need.)"
People commenting on other people's weight,"Just stop, please.

I lost a lot of weight recently because I went through something quite traumatic *and my friends are aware of that*.

I try not to make too big of a deal out of it. I don't comment on it, I talk about it only when I'm asked, except with a few very close friends. 

Yet so many people still frequently comment on my weight. Some of them because they are concerned, which I get, yet others because they are jealous, which I think is downright insulting, *and I'm just so done with it!*

Also so many people I just barely know and strangers talk about it too. It ranges from compliments to concerned comments. And I just don't get it. 

I wish people could understand that it's not okay to comment on other people's bodies, no matter what their intentions are!! It's none of your business, most of the time they have no idea what's going on so just, for the sake of God, stop!

You're not my therapist and if I'd want to talk about it I would. Period. 

You don't know what a person is going through. Maybe they have a medical reason, an eating disorder, maybe they're just built this way. Who knows. And why do you think it's your business anyway?"
I fucked up. Oh God did I fuck up. (x-post from several other subs),"Jesus Christ am I in deep. The last few days I've been texting a girl I used to be very close to, let's call her Allison. Well, I'm anxious to speak to her again because she was really a 'one that got away' sort of deal. She always had a thing for me but she never seemed that serious. Well, she texts me to wish me a Happy Thanksgiving, and I use the opportunity to strike up a conversation. I tell her I've missed her and have thought about her. We talk all night, and express that we've had deep feelings for each other that we've held back for a variety of reasons. We start talking about stuff that we can do to catch up, we've been flirting, everything is going amazing.

We talk all day for three days and I'm thrilled. She seems to be a little more mellow now than she was, but everything is fine. She also says that I've changed a lot since we've last spoken. Anyway, tonight we actually start talking about things of substance, and she brings up her ex-husband....

Allison was never married.

I'm texting a different fucking Allison....

This isn't the amazing ambitious girl that works at the homeless shelter and wants to become a nurse, this is the 35 year old that drove 40 minutes to watch me leave work. The one who I immediately regretted giving my number to because she texted me 40 times a day. The one who told my coworkers we were dating when I didn't even know her name.

So many details are coincidentally related, her ex lives in my college town, the distance is the same, all the little details are intertwined that I didn't realize for days.

What the fuck do I do now? If I just say ""oops my bad lol"" she'll be heartbroken, if I keep up the act she'll catch on eventually because I genuinely don't like her.... For fuck's sake help me."
Just to Tell Someone,"I was drugged and sexually assaulted by a female friend of mine. 

I was hanging out with her one day and she told me that she liked me and that she wanted to be with me. I told her I didn't want to be with her and tried to let her down and lightly as I possibly could. Then she got hysterical and told me she was going to cut herself and commit suicide and stuff like that.

She has a history of mental illness and self harm so I panicked and tried to calm her down and she just broke down in front of me crying. I held her and after a while she calmed down and asked if I wanted some soda. I accepted and we talked for a little bit.

At some point I blacked out. I don't remember anything from sitting on her couch to being naked on her bed. My groin was wet and  had scratched along the length of my chest. And she was sleeping right next to me, also naked, spooning me with her arm across my chest. 

I quietly got out of her bed and left. My clothes were dumped outside her room so I put them on and went home. From there I've only told a few people, but not the whole truth except for two."
My brother-in-law is probably going to die and he doesn't know yet.,"Last Thursday, before they went down to Florida for spring break, my sister called me and said that they had to take my brother-in-law to the ER for swelling in his ankles.  He's a 50 year old, healthy marathon runner who thought it was Achilles tendinitis, but when it happened to both ankles, he became concerned.  During the work-up, they had reason to perform a chest x-ray and found a mass in the lower right lobe of his lung.  Recommended a PET scan, which happened on the following Monday.  My brother-in-law insisted that my sister, her kids, and our parents go on their Florida trip while he stayed at home as planned.  He's a high school chemistry teacher and it wasn't his spring break (very Breaking Bad sounding.  I know).  My wife and I went with him to his pulmonology follow up on Tuesday for the results on the PET scan, where it was confirmed that he had cancer.  Tomorrow I'm taking him to  his bronchoscopy where they'll take a sample of the 2.5cm mass to see what kind of cancer it is.  Since my wife is an ER/critical care MD, my BIL forwarded all the reports to her to look at.
   
  Here's the kicker.  She took a look at the radiological interpretation last night and in no uncertain terms, he has stage 4 lung cancer.  PET scan revealed metabolic activity in his lung, rib, sternum, humorus, pelvis, possible neck lymph node, and possible colon.  There's a 5-10% chance of living after 5 years of treatment.  I say living, because with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer it's not about curing, but reducing the tumor and managing symptoms.  Bone cancer is painful.  Lung cancer will make it increasingly difficult to breath.  Ultimately, they'll have to decide how they want to proceed, but this isn't a bucket list situation.  There's no time for that and quality of life is expected to decrease very quickly with or without treatment.

He doesn't know it's stage 4 yet.  The pulmonologist confirmed cancer, but maybe he was relying on the oncologist to break the news.  Only my wife and I know, but we'll probably have a family meeting on Saturday to tell them.  I think it's better to hear it from a family member?  There's a very, very good chance he won't live to see his daughters graduate college/high school.  My sister will be a widow before 50.  We have smokers in our small extended family and by BIL is that LAST person I would have expected to get lung cancer.  He's the stereotypical ironic cancer patient.  50 years old, never smoked, beer once a month.  Ran multiple marathons a year and no other health issues. Now there's a 5-10% chance he'll be around in 5 years.  This most likely will not be a pretty treatment.  They'll probably recommend aggressively treating this with chemo, radiation, and possibly immuno therapy, but it's going to get ugly.

I'm still coming to grips with this but I needed to tell someone.  I feel like an asshole for thinking that there are much more ""deserving"" people in our family (life long unapologetic smokers) who deserve this, not the high school teacher in the middle of his life with two daughters.  His dad died a few years ago, but his mother will have to bury her son.  It all breaks my heart and this is just the beginning.  "
My friend and I are not dating.,"I felt a bit overwhelmed about things this morning - not in a bad way, just in a...brimming over way. Some of it spilled out on to paper and I felt the need to have someone, anyone, read it.

It is ever so strange to feel happy about something that isn't the way you want it to be.

Have you ever been consumed by somebody?

Have you ever had someone fill your every waking thought, even your dreams, and it burns you up from within - but not with a bright, hot passion. It burns you like hot, smoldering coals. It burns you in a way that you can't imagine coming to an end. It's not a desperate feeling.
It's...secure. Almost comfortable. It keeps you on your toes, keeps you restless, keeps you dancing...and yet you're happy here and you don't ever want it to stop. This dance has become home to you.

There are still days where you wish that they would get out of your head, leave you alone for five minutes, and yet you know that if they did you would find yourself lonely, wanting them back right away.

Most days you are like a warm blanket I love to throw over my shoulders and curl up with, but some days you reveal me. Some days your perfectly normal actions threaten to show me for who I really am and how I really feel. Yesterday when you woke up and came out in to the living room, I instinctively looked at you - but that fraction of a glance had me looking away immediately, despite what I wanted. I hope I didn't send the wrong message. What I really wanted was to look in to your eyes, levelly, as I always do, and tell you good morning - but I could not. That briefest of glances, revealing your state of hardly undressed, sent my self defense in to high gear.

I have seen plenty of men in their boxers. They are simply thinner shorts.

Yours, however, are burned in to the forefront of my memory despite how quickly I didn't quite look at you. Immediately I found it difficult to breathe. I could feel my body responding in obvious ways and I had to hide it from you. I didn't want you to see me struggle to maintain composure, so I looked away.

What I really wanted was to drink you in.

I wanted to look at you for long enough to burn the entire image in to my memory, every part of you, soft from sleep and slow from waking up. I wanted you to see the slow flush building up from my chest to my cheeks, I wanted you to see me breathing a little harder, I wanted you to notice the myriad of changes my body went through just at the simple vision of you just waking up.

Instead I prayed that your mother couldn't see how hard my nipples were. I looked away. I pretended to be working hard. I pretended that I wasn't thrilled with how comfortable it was to you to wake up and find me in your home, making myself at home, offering you your own coffee. That noting your good mood in the mornings wasn't the most amazing thing. That your mother hadn't offered me a key.

I acted nonchalant about the fact that you turned on Jeopardy, knowing we would both love to watch it.

Every day, I have to pretend not to notice the million little things you do for me. I pretend that I don't do a million little things for you. We pretend that we are not special to each other when we go out with others, and yet we do not sacrifice our special ways.

They notice.
They always notice.
They wonder.

And we love it. We love being on a team together. We love the harmless ""us against them"" mentality, the ""who cares what they think"" that brings us together. Neither of us generally admit it, but we do enjoy the attention. We enjoy having people notice us. We enjoy people noticing us in the same ways. Our music, our speech, our intelligence. We like for people to notice about us what we notice about others.

What we notice about each other.

I think we both enjoy having a story. We enjoy knowing that people are talking about us, perhaps even a little bit jealously, trying to figure out our mystery.

I wonder if you notice me the way I notice you. I wonder if you think about me the way I think about you. I wonder if you think about me the way I think about you, and wonder if I think about you the way you think about me. It would suit us to have that type of silent dynamic. It would make sense.

I wonder, if we ever spoke the words aloud, if it would set us both on fire."
"I'm the person everyone tells you isn't worth keeping in your life, so what the fuck do I do?","Have you ever read those posts? 

Y'know the one's- 

Perhaps it's an AITA or perhaps some relationship thread or basically having anything to do with interaction 

Whatever the post in question is you can always count on one reply 

'what a no good person to have in your life, it's about time to cut them off'

Well I introduce to you the type of person that reply is always referring to 

Me 

Cynical, devoid of meaning, angry, miserable, and a general threat to anyone who wants to be in a good mood 

I'm not often outwardly vile but I believe I am worse. I'm fake and happy at first but afterwards I sit around and ooze a venomous putrid happiness killing escense that murders all joy around me 

Joyless, miserable, and a burden to be around.

I can't help it I guess. I can't be fixed. I'm always the topic of that post...the one made by a guilty friend who cares but cannot handle this emotional toxin of a being any longer 

No one can 

There isn't any fixing me, some people just fall from the tree rotten and dying. There isn't anyone out there for me 

Not really anyways. I know what people like and what and I can be that. I can live to serve. But there will always be that horrid hour where the true nature of my being will burst from its thin cacoon with a veracious appetite for the joy around me, eating through and obliterating all of it like a black hole 

And so I sit here. It's really the best thing for you and me. 

It feels like I'm living under a lake watching all the pretty, fragile boats scoot past. I can't reach for any hand that breaches the waters surface or I am sure to drown anything I touch 

And so I sit here. No one should feel bad, in fact it is my personal belief that no one should know I exist. It's no ones fault 

Birds are born birds and fish are born fish 

I like that good people exist, I just wish I was on their side of this lake, I wish I could be better, I wish I didn't drown you 

Fin."
All my friends eventually forgot me.,"I know the title sounds stupid but I have my reasons. I am trying my best to keep myself busy and distracted. I always check on some of my close friends regularly after a week or so. Three weeks back I started working on a project and gaming in my free time. Today, I checked my cell phone after three weeks and I haven't received a single call or message from any of my friends or family. All my messages have been read but I never received a response from them. I know people are busy and not everyone is into texting. Even I'm not a fan of it. I realized that my conversations were always one sided. I was actually prying in their life and trying to ask about their well being. I saw their stories and posts, everyone is having a nice time with their family. I have lost the zeal to do anything more and keep myself sane. I tried going back to gaming but in the end it's still bothering me. Can someone provide some suggestions for coping with this loneliness?"
"I miss being in love, and I fill that void with meaningless sex. Pointless rant.","I miss being in love. There's been no greater feeling in my life than the feeling of loving and being loved by someone. I hate that I crave it so much but I do. I think for the last two years I've been filling that void with sex and it isn't working (to no ones surprise). I've gone from meaningless relationship to meaningless relationship without finding any happiness. Sure, I enjoy sex as much as the next person and  I can get it as often as I please but. That isn't what it's about. It never has been. And honestly I don't even get that much enjoyment out of it anyway- sex is good when you care about the person. If you don't care, it's lousy and pointless. 

Anyway, after two years of fucking around I keep thinking I found a keeper. The guy my friend introduced me to, the guy on my volleyball team, an old flame, a coworker- but every time it ends up like the last. I'm just the girl they want to fuck and that's it. You know what that's fine- if that's what you're looking for great! But why do I keep letting them do it?! I don't want it. But I do it. And it's really starting to take a toll on me emotionally. I have no one to blame but myself- and I've decided to stop. No more meaningless sex. No more hooking up with someone unless I see it going somewhere. And I mean it this time. 

Jesus this makes me sound like such a slut. I mean, I am I guess. Slut shamers would say so anyway, and it doesn't bother me. I'm safe and I don't care about judgement, I'm comfortable enough with my sexuality. 

I miss being in love. I'm so lonely that way. Haha, and my guy friends all say the same thing. ""You're amazing! You'd be the perfect girlfriend. I mean I wouldn't date you- but you'll find him"". And I know I will. Of course I will but I just miss it. I guess. 


Jesus listen to me. There are worse things in life than loneliness. Im healthy, I have my family and friends and sanity. I'm not that bad off. I just miss laying around the house with someone doing nothing but being in each other's company. I miss the caress with nothing more behind it than wanting to touch them. I miss staring into someone's eyes because you know exactly what they're thinking and you don't have to say anything. I miss the midnight phone call because they're a province away and just wanted to hear my voice. I miss listening to music and hating it because it's not my kind of music but not minding because what makes him happy makes me happy. I miss trying so hard to cook a nice meal and failing miserably and laughing so hard about it with someone. I miss being on someone's mind. 


I'm just lonely. 

Sorry for the completely meaningless rant. Maybe I just put my thoughts on screen away from my brain. My heart. "
My step dad beat me.,"I'd like to say yes the Police know. 

Depressed, unemployed, lonely and sad. I have no friends, my Mom sided with my step dad and is more angry at me than him. My real dad is furious. 

My jaw won't close all the way, I have 2 black eyes and a huge bump on my head, I can't chew food properly. 

The dudes an alcoholic, drug user who is just an asshole. I told him, he pushed me and I pushed back. One thing lead to another and there I am pinned against a chair having my head pounded in 5-10 times. I don't remember. 

My mom was furious with me. Apparently a ploy to separate them. 

I don't know where I am with life. I have no friends, I'm unemployed, depressed. I think about just ending it all, all the time. I feel no support from my family at all (only my dad, but he's controlling)I try to be happy, and for the most part I feel happy, but I can't seem to make and keep others happy. 

My skype is iilovemiley and Im Nick. I wouldn't mind a friend, or someone to talk to. "
Sort of boyfriend maybe sort of breaking up with me.,"I met a guy in January, and we started off just hooking up now and then. We quickly became friends with benefits. And by the beginning of April we were best friends and pretty serious about being with each other. We both left university for summer break in May, and haven't seen each other in person since. We live 1000 miles apart. We text/e-mail/video chat with a rough estimate of 4 hours worth of communication each day. He's been going back and forth between coming back to our university or staying in his home state. My heart has broken each time he decided to stay there, and I've rejoiced each time he decided to return. I'm getting some serious whiplash. Today tuition is due at 4pm, and if he does nothing about it, he has no choice but to stay at home. He has yet to make a final decision. I've been trying to back off and let him make up his own mind. Giving honest opinions of each option (setting my emotions aside I think he should stay there). I want to just leave him alone today so he can think. But I'm just going crazy. 

**Update:** Thank you all for your kind words and advice. He has decided to stay at home, which hurts me, but I know it's what's best for him. And I know I'll be alright - 21 is still pretty young. We've always kept up solid and honest communication, so he knew exactly where I stood on the issue, and that's the advice I'd give to anyone in a similar situation. Again, thanks!"
Here I am opening up for the first time to some strangers on the internet," 

Idk where to start. Tbh Im ashamed cuz I am asking for help. I can't really open up to anyone with my deeper problems. I feel like im stuck in this life thing or Im doing something wrong. My problems arent even that bad tbh but how I feel about them is way worse.

So Im young 21, I have a good career in front of me Im doing college I am good looking imo, I think Im pretty popular also, I got a lot of friends but I can't really talk to anyone about how I feel, actually I feel more alone than ever. I don't even cry anymore, everything is building up in me. I got a dysfunctional family with alcoholics and for the last year I am becoming like them. Most problems I have right now is due to my drinking, such as losing some friends, respect, feeling sad, can't handle with heavy stuff without drinking... I decided to stop drinking... again, but everytime a struggle comes I relapse. Im broke because of my alcohol.

I actually know why I started drinking in the first place but I don't know how to handle it. The root problem of all is failing to succeed in stuff such as sport or music and lack of love/need of love and admiration. I got a lot of hobbies that I want to turn into something big but Im failing in doing that. I realize i can't be the best or a pro in a year or two but I don't really see any progress in sports or music even tho I try to do it at least 3 times a week even tho I still drink n all. With sport is simple like I trained in a lot of sports but Im no better than an average joe who plays those sport occasionally. With music is just that I like my music but no one else listens to it. But I think this need to succeed in stuff is because I want to gain more respect and admiration.

Everyday I realize I am nothing special even tho I dreamt of that as a little kid. I wasn't raised in perfect standards but who was, I got a lot of bullying as kid cuz I was a nice. That left a lot of scars but I changed a lot since then. The stuff that hurts most is that I feel I lack love and I need it. I want to be in a relationship but at the same time I don't want to be in one. Everytime I go out with a girl I like I mostly change my mind about her the next day. The few relationships I had lasted no more than a week. I know so many people who are in realtionships for years and are happy with them. I feel like I don't deserve to be happy like them sometimes. I feel like, when the time for real relationship with the right one will come, I won't have enough experience with it. Thats the worst part-lack of experience in relationships and that Im not ready yet. I fear going intimate with someone else but at the same time I torture my self because I am still alone and I lack love. Im losing love for myself with it.

I hate being alone, I go out with people all the time but It just feels like a waste of time atm, partying or going for a coffee n stuff... I don't really enjoy it that much anymore except if there is alcohol involved. I don't really listen to what people say anymore I can't focus on it. And the funny thing is that people keep complaining to me about their problems and I help them fix it. But I myself haven't talked to anyone about my problems. Even if I do talk about surface problems people really can't really help me.

The first thing I think I should do right now is to stop drinking and stop socializing all the time because its wasting my time. I think I should pick up another sport and start serious with it so I can replace it with all that BS. As for relationships I don't really know what I should do here, Im prolly just gonna wait until the right one comes, but I am way too picky so its gonna take a while and even if it happens my lack of experience will prolly mess it all up.

Im really grateful that someone actually took their time to read this mess. I think Im facing the enemy within but I don't know how to beat him.

If anyone has any advice or comment about all these problems I would be very happy to read em all, since this is the first time I actually opened up. Im comfortable opening up cuz you are all strangers n all and at this moment I don't really know what I should do because my brain don't fully work for me anymore I guess."
My life has literally fallen down around me. Hope it's for the best.,"Had a high risk pregnancy, had babe via c section because he flipped somewhere between 37 and 38 weeks which was traumatic enough, he was diagnosed with ftt (failure to thrive) at about two months, then I had my gallbladder out at 4 months post partum which took double the amount of time and I needed a drain.

I have sensory issues with touch and all of this was fucking hell two invasive and full on surgeries in four months plus a failed breastfeeding journey. 

I also failed my first year of uni due to all of that. It was ambitious to try, but I didn't expect any of it. 


Through the pregnancy my (now ex) partner wasn't as supportive as I needed him to be and became low key emotionally manipulative and abusive. It got worse post babe and gave him a year to sort his shit out. 

We're at the year mark now and I've ended it after 8.5 years and an 18 month old babe. 

I tried uni again this year and managed to pass two topics. First semester was a wreck due to my (ex)partner and all his emotional shit, which is where I passed two topics. I was then precluded from studying second semester because I failed two topics, two years in a row and didn't provide proof (I giggle now because I didn't get any of the letters until I finished half the semester and did almost 50% of the work for all my topics). 


So. I'm living at my parents with 0 income, 20% care of my babe (which will change soon), and just feeling like I'm at the bottom of anything and everything. 

It all fucking sucks but I hope this is the start of some sort of good something."
My dad is trying his best to screw me over,"tl;dr- Sued dad for charges on credit card he opened in my name. He claims I lack consideration and have a misplaced sense of entitlement. 

Long story short, my parents opened credit cards and lines of credit in my name when I was 17. Essentially, my identity was stolen by them. Since December of 2011, I've been evicted from a rented house I was never on the lease for (and now have a $4600 judgement for nonpayment of rent), had $1750 stolen from my paypal account from a very valuable item of mine that I sold, and $8000 worth of debt from a chase credit card I never opened, a billmelater account I never used, and the wells fargo credit card I opened just to establish credit when I was 16. 

I had a combined total of $8000 credit card debt, $4600 judgement against me, and a missing $1750. I graduated college in December of 2011, and had no job. I moved back to our home of 13 years only to find out 2 weeks later that the home was forclosed and we had to move in early January. My parents rent a house up the street and used a Chase credit card in my name that I hadn't known about. They had used it to buy Christmas presents despite my dad earning over $200,000/year. They took out $3000 in cash advances to pay for the houses security deposit, maxing out my $3000 credit card to $4800 dollars -- something I didn't even know was possible. I was unaware of this at the time, not finding out about this credit card until May of 2012. 

May 2012 my parents start getting a divorce. My dad refuses to pay my mom spousal support until court ordered, resulting in evicting procedings. Both parents hid from me that, despite me never having signed the lease, I was also listed on the eviction. They both file answers, hide my court summons from me, and let me take the fall since I didn't show up for a court date I never knew about. 

I never knew about my eviction until December of 2012 when I tried to get my own apartment so I didn't have to live with my mother anymore. In July, I file small claims cases against my parents to repay me this debt. My mom and I come to a settlement and she's been making payments to me every month and still owes me $3000/$5500. My dad fought me tooth and nail, claiming my mom was to blame for everything. He has tried having me sign shady legal documents while trying to settle the case which would have me forefeit all the money, and an additional $46,000 he stole from me in 1997 that he never told me about. The judge granted me a full judgement as of July 31st (our court date). I discovered my dad has filed a supplimental opposition to my small claims lawsuit stating that ""Alexinedh is 23 years old, lacks consideration, and has a misplaced sense of entitlement. His mother and I paid for all of his expenses until he was almost 22 years old, and I helped him get a job with [Dad's employer here, not mine] where I have worked for many years."" 

This statement specifically infuriates me. I just want to be repaid for stuff I was never spected to pay for, such as his sewage/water bills, vacations he and my mother took without me, and a $1200 storm door they bought for a rental property THEY were renting. I don't even work for the company he works for and never have. I currently have a job that required 4 YEARS of applying for, which has a requirement of a very specific college degree just to apply for, at a company he has NEVER worked for. 

Most likely I would win an appeal process, it just bugs me so much that someone says this is my fault. "
I don't know why I married my wife,"We have been married for 5 years. I had doubts about doing it before our wedding, I had doubts our wedding day, I have doubts today. We are good friends, we have fun togheter, but I don't have desire for her. I look at her body and feel nothing; having sex is a chore I force myself to do once in a while. I always wanted to have kids, and I feel she doesn't want it. I don't have the guts to ask her, and I don't know what would be worst: never having kids or having kids with her (if I don't love her). Sometimes I fantasize about her dying or just leaving me, so I don't have to do anything.

Then again there are times when I look at her and fee a deep love for her.

It's complicated."
Racism. My Thoughts. Discussion?,"This post represents what I think about what's currently happening in my country today. In it, I share my first experience with racism and the biggest lie about racism that's still being told now. It is a post that I wrote out of frustration, disgust, and fear. I wanted to share it here, to vent, but hopefully to start a discussion. 

Please mods, if it's not allowed, remove it. 

Currently, I'm a white woman living in the Deep South of the USA, what we call the Bible Belt. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, I've seen some of my (now *former*) friends and family members either try to justify, defend, and some outright agree with the racism that is happening in my country. I sent the contents of this post to them and asked if I was somehow misunderstanding what they were trying to say. Almost all of them replied and all of the replies broke my heart. After they so proudly defended their ignorance, I replied, ""As much as it pains me, I'm not comfortable remaining in touch with anyone whose values oppose mine so radically."" and I blocked them. 

I saw this put beautifully earlier and it's stuck with me: ""You cannot say 'All Lives Matter' until black lives do. 

The atrocities being heaped upon our black communities should make you sick. There should be crying, wailing, and gnashing of teeth at what we're hearing about right now. There is no justification or excuse for such heinous actions. 

Do you want to know what one of my very first memories is? As a kindergartener (age 5), I remember coming home from school and telling my (then)stepdad that I made a new friend: Stephen. Then, I said that me and Stephen were gonna get married. That's the first (but not last) time, I can remember being asked, ""What does Stephen look like? What color is he: does his skin look like yours or is it darker?"" I got my ass whooped for that one and told ""Not in my house"", but with the worst language you ever did say, much less direct at a 5 year old.

In sixth grade, my entire class was made to write an essay. ""My Eyes Don't See Color."" As I remember writing that essay, we were made to explain just how much we didn't notice the color of someone's skin. As 11 year olds, we were required to write a paper to show that 'racism no longer exists'. 

You cannot sit there and tell me that racism no longer exists. To have the nerve to think that we 'don't see color' and everyone is treated equally is demeaning, ignorant, and downright dangerous. The racism in this country has been shown to us, time and time again. Yet, time and time again, we turn a blind eye to their plight. 

We, as white people, need to do better. Stop and acknowledge our privilege. Realize that we did nothing to earn this privilege. Understand that our privilege comes at the detriment of others. That just because we live in a country that values our white skin tone above others, certain aspects of our lives have been made more simple.  

I refuse to stand by any longer. This injustice will not be tolerated. My outrage will not be silenced. I will fight alongside you for as long as it takes. I will use my privilege to instigate change, to bridge the gap of inequality between us. 

My eyes DO see color and if you're being honest with yourself, so do yours."
"Dear life, please. Get better.","I do honestly feel like I am going crazy right now.

I know that right now is strange time for everybody But I feel like for me everything is going down way worse.

So basically my university got shut down around three weeks ago. The Monday after it got shut we got a message that one of our fellow Professors we had lessons on Friday with, is Corona positive.
I showed some symptoms of Coronavirus after that but still did not manage to get a test done, since I am very low in the queue of my local doctor. 
By now I'm feeling better but not with my mental health.
The thing is that I have been writing an exam around one month ago and i really feel like that I messed it  up. I will get the results on the second of April, however I really feel like I messed it up. If I mess up that exam when I will lose my job.

So basically before this whole Corona  shit started i was already mindfucked. Problem now is that my girlfriend did not really support me. At that time we have been a couple since one year and eleven months. On the first of April we would be a couple for exactly 2 years.
However since around that time she is trying to meet up with her old friends and stuff which is good and all but I wanted her to be there for me in the time when I felt really like shit.
Which she obviously wasn't. 

Ever since that day things have changed quite a lot for worse. 
As of right now we are not a couple anymore but we are not broken up. We are basically doing a break.
In the past few days we have been calling each other and we really had want talk when we were really talking about having sex together again and  we would love to see each other again which was not possible because I was in Quarantine. 
Quarantine ended on the 27th  of March, however I'm really feeling very very very bad in the past few days because I do not enjoy gaming anymore. I have been gaming since I was 11 years old, which is 9 years ago.
I don't have to go to university anymore and I cannot see anything or basically i have nothing to do.



So my problems right now: i have a girl that I love more than everything but I don't think that she loves me anymore.
 I'm probably about to lose my job and since I don't enjoy gaming anymore i feel like I'm going crazy because I have absolutely nothing to do during the day. I have been doing sports in the past three years and I'm still doing it but since Coronavirus is there at the moment there is no possibility for me to do it outside and you know I cannot train everyday at my home.

I really just hope that there's something in the next few days that will cheer me up again. Because of right now I am hoping that the second of April all the first of April will do something for me.

Maybe the first of April will do something for me because that would be the day for me and my ex girlfriend when we would be a couple for exactly two years. 
Second of April might do something for me because then I will get the results. That will let me know if I have to start everything all over again, with studying and so on. 

Don't get me wrong if I lose my job right now I have something else that I will study and it's no problem at all. It's just that I really want life to get better by now.

My gf says that she still loves me. But she is so distant in the past few days. 

I want to be free, I want my gf back. I want my life to be good again."
My girlfriend of 4 years has left me because she no longer loves me,"I’ve been with this girl for 4 years, we were so deeply in love, we have travelled to 5 different countries together and always been there for each other. 

We have never had many friends but we always had each other. 

And recently she was very distant and I finally pulled it out of her - she doesn’t love me anymore (mainly because we have little in common - something that has never bothered me) and wants to move on. 

This fucking SUCKS. I am absolutely heart broken. It sound so cringy but she is literally my best fucking friend and I love her more than anything in this entire world. 

My whole world is shattered"
My dog died :(,He was hit by a car.

"My friends GF is a cunt, and I can't do shit about it.","In short, she's a selfish, 2 faced, controlling, child. My friend is too stupid to think he can do better and just keeps getting pulled along.

Let's go over everything she does/has done.
-Cheats on him with his/my friend, then threatens that person that if they say anything, she'll accuse him of raping her.
-Uses self harm as a threat to control her partner. She will hurt herself if he doesn't do what she wants.
-Controls who he can do things with, what he can be doing, and when he can be alone. Ex: ""disapproves"" of him seeing me, his ""best friend"".
-Has been with 4 of our mutual friends before him. And does the same stuff every time.
-Isn't really atteactive, physically or otherwise, she just prays on the low self esteem.
-Just a seriously weird, rude, mean cunt. That's the best way I have to put it. She's just not a nice person to her ""friends"" who she lost from being a cunt, and everyone else. 
-Makes him dependent on her. 

I don't even care about my ""friend"" anymore, I just really, really hate this person. And everyday I have to notice that she's still existent. And he will **never** leave her at this point. She's not even on the sociopath level of controlling, she is just an insecure, selfish, dependant bitch. 

I just want her to leave me alone. She's been fucking my friends for 5 years, hopping one to another and I'm disgusted."
I learned how to set boundaries and it made me realize how toxic and manipulative my friend/roommate has been towards me.," Hello,

My current roommate and I used to be inseparable best friends for a couple years, and have been roommates for a long time (close to 5 years). I used to be very naive - I didn't know how to set boundaries, didn't have the confidence to stand up for myself, and was too forgiving. This person is incredibly controlling, bossy, non-empathetic, and borderline narcissistic and I have endured what some other people in my life have titled her behavior as emotional abuse. I have only within the last year or so realized how detrimental this relationship has been to my mental health, self-esteem, and other relationships.

Below, you will find text screenshots of three different situations (only a few of many) that have happened within the last year and you can observe how she acts towards me and vice versa. 

I will also note that one of the biggest fights we have ever had is not captured because I was so upset and distraught that I deleted the entire text conversation and can't find a way to recover it. Summarized, she became enraged when I told her I was going on a date with someone (who is now my SO of almost a year). She told me that I was depressed and lonely, and that I needed to get the idea of being in a relationship out of my head because it wasn't ever going to work out. I had spent two years prior to this being single and working a lot on myself and furthering my career after struggling with anxiety and some depression.

Situation 1: Accused of stealing butter [https://imgur.com/a/J415dd4](https://imgur.com/a/J415dd4)

Situation 2: The first night I stayed at my SO's place overnight because I was tired and couldn't safely drive home without my glasses (which I forgot) [https://imgur.com/a/7wl4Oaz](https://imgur.com/a/7wl4Oaz)

Situation 3: I had recently got a full time, salaried position in my career field after working in retail for nearly two grueling years. She was upset that we couldn't ever hang out, even though we lived together, watched TV together, made dinner together, but would never try to make plans with me outside of that. So it's my fault. [https://imgur.com/a/0h6zMDW](https://imgur.com/a/0h6zMDW)

I am just so frustrated with myself for being passive and so dismissive of her words and actions over the past and for how long it took me to realize that this relationship takes a massive mental toll on me and is not healthy at all."
i don’t ever want to have children; but my family doesn’t want to hear it,"so let me start at the beginning. i’m 25 right now and i’m currently studying to be a private investigator. but when i graduate at 27, in my culture, i’m expected to find a career, and then a husband, and then have children after a few years of marriage.  

but here is the thing: i never, and i mean NEVER want to go through having children. i hate the sound of babies crying,  (i have Misophonia) every time i see a new mother they look like death, and i have mental illness and i could never forgive myself if i were to pass that on to my “offspring”. it’s hard cause it’s not just my family too, it’s my friends, and i remember when my mom and i were at Leon’s (you know, the furniture store) a few years ago and i mentioned this to which the clerk said: “oh she’s young, she’ll change her mind.”  

i have considered stabbing myself in the uterus multiple times in my life, getting tubal litigation but i was rejected cause i was too young and never wanted children and now it’s gotten to the point that every time i even think about pregnancy i feel like i want to kill myself. i’ve struggled with suicidal tendencies for most of my teenage and adult life, and this is triggering it again. i know i have tokophobia, and i’ve known i don’t want children ever since i was 9 years old."
My last days of being a teenager are most likely going to be awful.,"So obviously I'm 19, gonna turn 20 in a week.

I'm currently in my fourth semester of uni. My last days of being a teenager are going to be very sad, much like most of my teen years. I don't have a friend group here in college. College was supposed to be a spire of hope and happiness compared to high school. Instead, I have to CONSTANTLY watch other people who are around around my age have aspects of life that I would kill for. What are these aspects? Well, having a real friend group, going to parties, experiencing relationships/intimacy/sex. These are common, healthy things that I should be doing, but no. My toxic and depressing upbringing has fucked me, and I don't think I can fix myself.

The thing I worry about the most is the relationships/sex/intimacy part. I do not necessarily care about being labeled as a ""virgin"", I care/worry about the fact that I have never experienced anything related to sex or romance. No sex, oral, kissing, hand-holding, not even a hug. No girl has ever liked me or thought I was attractive. I can't wrap my head around this shit. Prom? Like... asking someone out when you're 17/18 and going on a date with them/maybe even having sex? This is a common thing and it's ok, but I just fucking can't believe I'm past that age and still haven't experienced anything close to it. So I feel like I missed the ""learning"" portion of my life and now I'm fucked. I would like to experience these things with someone else who has no experience (it's a personal thing, I just think it's sweet) but as I enter my 20s, the chances of that happening become slim. When I see couples that are my age or younger, I get unbelievably jealous and sad. I know that's not healthy, but I can't help it. I hate that I'm saying this, but I really want a girlfriend. Not just for the sake of having a girlfriend, but because... well I assume love is a fucking nice thing, don't lie to me.

For the next week, I'll witness people around my age being normal teenagers, having fun, and I will frequently have to stop myself from committing suicide. On my last day of being a teenager, I'll be seeing my therapist. It'll have been one year since I tried to get close with a girl and got rejected. I crumbled that day, and I will crumble a year later. I already know I'm going to be crying so hard that I won't be able to even fucking speak. That's how I'll be spending my last days as a teenager. Fucked.

I'm leaving a period of my life that I can't get back, and it's killing me :("
"Please, how do I cope with my mom's death?","My mom has been addicted to crack since her teens (she is in her 40's now). Due to lack of insurance and just giving up on her health, over the past few years she has been deteriorating in front of me and my brother's eyes. Though we used to butt heads, since going off to college we have grown closer, like best friends. I don't have many friends and never grew up with any family, so Im lost on how to cope. We can't afford a funeral of any kind. What do we do with all the stuff in her apartment? How do we handle her debt? Her rent?my brother is in his last year of high school and I'm only a sophomore in college.
  I'm an athiest and believe that when she dies she will be relived of all the pain of her addiction. i suffer from severe depression and worry what effect the stress will  have on me.
I just feel so selfish worrying about the financial part of her dying. I know it's coming. She is getting sicker and sicker each day..."
"This week, my husband got laid off, my vehicle broke down tonight right before a long trip for Thanksgiving and there is a storm and our roof just started leaking.",I am finding it harder and harder to stay positive with the sound of water dripping into a bucket in my bedroom.
"Tomorrow (Jan 1) is my birthday, and I hate it","I can't even tell you exactly why. Maybe it's because my birthday parties always revolved around a New Years Eve party. Maybe because my family can't be assed to just call and say Happy Birthday. Maybe because when I say I want to do nothing for my birthday, that isn't good enough. I truly don't know. But here I am, a 33 (tomorrow) father of 3, sitting in the bathroom crying over it being my birthday.

This is such a dumb thing."
Update: at dinner mom said she was thankful for my sisters and brother and did not mention me in from of my entire family and aunt and cousin,"Aunt is giving me dirty looks and I suspect that my parents complained about me to her. We’re eating at home, a meal of rice and chicken, after grocery shopping to save money on food. I spent the day writing and doing lsat problems. I haven’t left the hotel suite at all. I have not tried to talk to them about how they make me feel. I have just been miserably counting down until this will be over. 

If we cant afford to eat out on vacation why the fuck did we go on vacation?"
I enjoy hearing my roommates have sex entirely too much.,"I don't even want to hear it, but it's apparently the best sex anybody has ever had ever ever, and I can hear every sound through our very thin walls. 

What inspired this topic and made me feel guilty was I could hear him spanking her HARD. **WHACK** and a moan. **WHACK** and a louder moan. I can hear her talking dirty. I can hear how fast he's fucking her because the bed creaks. I can hear them kiss (I assume not just faces). I hear *everything*.

And I feel guilty, because I enjoy listening to it entirely too much. I feel like I should leave when they're going at it, but 1. I don't want to, and 2. They bang it out at random times during the day, usually three or four times, sometimes more.

And yes, I do masturbate to it. And yes, I am aware that's probably creepy as hell.

They just went at it for 45 very intense minutes, ending in an extremely loud female orgasm, and now I think they're doing it again."
I like a guy and I'm a guy.,"I'm terribly in love with this guy, but I can't do anything about it because I'd be judged and shunned away. I hated myself all the time for this. I see him everyday in class but I can't go and talk to him because I'm afraid of all the homophobic people I have in my life. Nobody would ever accept me for who I am. 

The fact that I can't do anything to pursue the feelings I have for him is eating me up. I can't eat, I can't sleep I can't focus on anything. Why me? What did I do to have feelings for someone from the same sex and mind numbingly doing absolutely nothing about it. 

Why can't I just be normal? It's the worst punishment anyone could ever go through in their lives. I terribly hate myself for falling for him. I can't live with this despair anymore. I feel so hopeless and helpless. I feel like dying, just to get away from this pain. The pain of having so much dreams and hopes but not being able to go a step further to make it possible. 

It makes me so depress, I'm not that kind of person but keeping the feelings for him to myself doesn't help a bit. Oh my God! why all these happening to me? "
"My selfish, abusive mother disowned me while dealing with kidney failure that she caused. Let me explain... (Incredibly long, but I need help so bad...)","Part 1: The Setup


My mother has never been good to me. She has always adored my twin sister, to the point that, when my sister smashed me in the head with a rock when I was nine, I awoke to see my mom comforting my crying sister. Because she was the victim.

If I got into every detail, I'd be here all week, and no one wants to read that. But mom would lose patience with me and after age eleven refused to discipline me. She would tell my dad lies about what I had ""done"". He handled my discipline; at age nine I called him ""Igor"" in my diary - the willing servant. The most damaging entry has to be when she accused me of groping my pubescent sister.

I was the Stoop Kid from Hey Arnold! I wasn't allowed to leave my yard, and kids used to ride by my house and laugh at me. As a teenager with a girlfriend, she got worse. Her controlling behavior became so bad that she often accused me of things I could prove I didn't do, but it didn't matter: mom's word was gospel.

I was required to stay home four nights a week, and I had a ""dating rulesheet"" I had to adhere to that specified holding hands as ""the same as sex"". She had a weird love of popping zits and blackheads, and one day she wanted to get a tender one residing along my spine. She climbed on my back and used her weight to force me on the bed when I wasn't expecting it, and I pulled a muscle in my back. Once face-down on the bed, I rolled out from under her, and she screamed at me for ""hitting"" her. Dad hit me for ""hitting"" her.

So many stories, so little space...

But dad was also my hero. He defended me from mom when he could, but he could never understand that she was doing 97% of her abuse when he wasn't there. I told him that she was lying about the things she said I ""did"", but mom's word was gospel.

When I lost my virginity at sixteen, she locked herself in the room and went through a ""grieving period"", because that's normal, right? She chased me to my room one night, and I told her to get out; I was rewarded with a palm to the ear, which ruptured my left ear drum.

Oh, but that's not all:
 
- I was hit in the kneecap by a toy thrown by my dad, and left with a deep bruise which encircled the entire joint. During marching season.

- I was punched in the throat for hanging out with a friend who wouldn't date my sister.

- My 85 lb body was pinned against the wall by my 220 lb dad, who called me a pussy and dared me to hit him. My mom crossed her arms and smiled, having accused me of putting a virus on her computer.

But again, not enough time or space.

Dad always came back and apologized for what he'd done; mom has never apologized for a thing in her life and meant it. And in my brainwashed mind, I thought I deserved this treatment. I thought an apology would absolve the problem, and I was convinced that an apology meant it would stop. So mom's a sick, conniving bitch, and dad is an angry, gullible bear of a man.

Around age sixteen, at 135 pounds, I finally pushed back. Literally. I locked arms with dad, and held my ground. His face went from red to pale, I shoved, and dad later said, while apologizing, that I was getting too big to tangle with. I was no longer intimidated.

But dad was also my best friend. I could tell him anything. He'd lock my secrets up like the Fort Knox of filing cabinets. We crossed the country by highway together. I think that's what I miss the most. If mom weren't in the picture, things with us would be okay. He'd have never done those things to me. But if mom's the president and dad's the army, then he is still bound to use judgment in deciding the execution of orders. And he fucked up. A lot.


Part 2: The Sickening

When I was eighteen, I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Mom decided soon after that she would find the cure. She spent thousands on internet cures, and I tried them to be a good sport. More often than not, I got much more sick than without them, and I stopped taking them. I tried one method for eight months, losing weight and energy the whole time, and after stopping I got the phrase that I was so used to by now: ""If only you'd done it longer, it would have worked. You always 'poo-poo' (dismiss) all my ideas. I've wasted thousands...""

But like a good (brainwashed) sport, I kept trying the homeopathic/alternative bullshit. I developed horrible arthritis - and a painkiller addiction - because of all of her ""treatments"". Then I moved off for my bachelor's degree.

What I left out until now is that I suspect mom of Munchausen's and Munchausen's by Proxy. If I got the hiccups, she got them twice as often. If I had diarrhea, she was also vomiting. My first girlfriend was in the hospital with leukemia, and mom hit the ER at least twice. I swear to God, if you said your dick was big she'd say hers was bigger. And none of it has ever been true.


Part 3: The Burning

I moved with my fiancee of eight years into an apartment near campus, 70 miles from home. I was taking a vitamin regimen my mom set up, and I was in both incredible pain and shedding weight. I skipped a lot of class. I would wake up, start bawling, lay my head in my fiancee's lap and cry until she had to go to work. So I'd sleep eight hours until she got home. Something was wrong, but I didn't know what. I moved from six 10 mg lortab a day to Fentanyl patches, then to four 10 mg percocets a day. Then I began taking probiotics, at mom's suggestion.

In January, I stayed with my parents for a weekend before a spinal surgery to finally fix my pain. The night before, mom told me about the new extra strength probiotics she'd bought, and told me to take two of them. I did.

The next morning, I was standing in the bathroom when the pain hit. I hit the floor and started vomiting. At the ER, I was abused by a nurse who grabbed my face, called me a wimp for crying and bellowing once, and informed the doctor that I was drug-seeking. I went to CAT scan, which revealed the pancreatitis that was about to kill me.


Part 4: The Failure

I spent a week in ICU, during which time my kidneys failed. I was in a virtual state of lucid coma. The Versed kept me awake, yet incapable of forming memories. It also made me extremely suggestible. During this time, mom made arrangements to move me back home, coerced me into denouncing my fiancee (who was then confronted at my house with bullshit allegations), forged my signature and opened a credit card in my name (legitimately for me, but still...), and begin accusing me of faking my pain for drugs.

The cause of the kidney failure? The combination of supplements I was on had chemically burned and scarred my kidney cells. The pancreatitis? The probiotics the night before.


Part 5: The Nightmare Begins

Mom began a crusade against the drugs that were keeping my pain under control and keeping me sane during my two-month hospital stay. She cornered my doctors and nurses, who willingly violated HIPAA and listened to her bitch about my ""addiction"". She screamed at me every night. She threw a water bottle over my head and into the wall. She slammed my laptop on a table. My dad couldn't control her.

I was put on a special and very restrictive renal diet. I was only allowed food that the cafeteria would send me according to my diet, but mom somehow grew convinced that I was cheating on my diet. Going home after two months was bittersweet: I missed my dog, I missed my bed, but I knew the monster I was moving in with.

My dad put my clothes and all my essential things in my room as they were before I left for school. I opened a drawer and saw my neatly folded clothes, and I hit the floor. I wasn't going to make it without dad. He and my fiancee had a burden, but they'd never failed me. Not in a situation like this.

Mom made all my food. The dialysis left me with little energy, and when I wasn't sleeping, I was either eating, shitting, or seeing my gal. I went out every week or so with my friends for a long time. I just didn't have the energy, and I always left early to crash. I was doing everything I could to hold myself together.

But mom decided that I was ""partying"" all the time. She accused me of breaking my diet, even though my nutrient blood tests came back perfect without fail. She told me that I wasn't going to ""hurt"" myself in her house. I lost touch with myself; I lost hope. It fucked with my head. I thought I was doing something horrible to myself without realizing it. After all, dad and my sister were with mom on this one.

The screaming happened daily. My dad was free once again to jab, scream at, and intimidate me. They said it all. I wasn't doing enough work around the house. I was sleeping too much. I was eating all wrong. Tests proving otherwise didn't matter. She demanded that I ask permission to eat certain meals and snacks. When I told my mom that I was thinking of suicide, she made fun of me. When I told dad, he told me I needed help and walked off.

But I didn't need help COPING with the bullshit - I needed the bullshit to stop. A therapist can't do that.

I moved in with my grandparents and aunt, who took care of me, but doubted my claims. My mom then made an appointment I didn't request at the Mayo in Minnesota, without my permission, when I wasn't ready to go. She said she was going to pay for it, but it actually cost me $1700.

On the trip, dad said that the bullshit would stop. If it didn't, he said he'd have failed me.

Just a few days after going back home, dad started in on the bullshit himself. On top of that, I developed chronic pancreatitis. Strangely, mom diagnosed herself as having a precancerous pancreas. She also began claiming she had mold poisoning, several years after legit poisoning had been resolved. She began fearing the NSA, the FBI, the FAA, and started claiming that my family was being targeted by bioterrorists bent on population control. She was fucking insane.

I told her all of that was bullshit, and behind closed doors my dad and sister agreed with me. But to her face, they supported her nonsense. After dad jabbed me in the ribs hard enough to be bruised just an inch from my dialysis catheter, I left again. The other end of that catheter is in my heart.


Part 6: Disowned

After I left, mom began claiming that I was kicked out for ""abusing"" her. When asked how I abused her, she just said that I had told my dad to ""control [his] woman."" I'd admit it if that was true, and even if I had, that's nothing compared to the treatment I received.

She calls anyone who'll answer the phone (a dwindling roster of ladies) and tells them that I'm trying to kill myself by breaking my diet, as though she's seen me eat in the last two months, or as though I don't have a .45 in my truck.

Dad claims that his marriage to mom is paramount. He has taken her side on every occasion, although attempting to appear fair. Over beers, I told him of my suicide plan back when I tried to warn them. He was apologetic and remorseful for missing the signs, and we parted as friends again.

Now, my fiancee and I have decided to buy a house. We've never had anything of our own. I asked dad to go to the bank with me to walk me through the loan process and to look at a property. Dad walked out to the car already pissed. He started a fight with me and blamed me for not accepting that I won't get an apology and for not ""burying the hatchet"" with my mother.

He screamed at me, called me names, and criticized me for wanting a house instead of an apartment. He complained about his life and claimed that my kidney ""issues"" were better than what he has to ""deal"" with. I took it all, but quietly changed course to take him back home. He then said something that REALLY got me: he told me that I should stay under mom's thumb longer. 

I saw red. I punched my steering wheel repeatedly, almost sideswiped  a van, and screamed back. I told him that I only wanted what he had at 25: a home, a family, a job, etc. He claimed that he was ""miserable"" at 25, to which I replied: ""Oh, and so I have to be as well?""

He then called me an idiot, and I let him have it. ""DON'T CALL ME ANYMORE FUCKING NAMES!!! I HAVEN'T CALLED YOU ANYTHING, AND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!! AM I CLEAR?!!"" He didn't answer, but he did bail out of my truck at 20 MPH. I learned shortly after that my mother had disowned me. Dad was pissed because she had threatened him for ""aiding the enemy"". Because her own son is the enemy.

So now my brainwashed father is threatening me on a regular basis, and my mom is phone-bombing everyone to tell lies about me. My sister is also pissed at my mom about their own conflict, but she can't rationalize that I'm going through the same thing with her. My own twin won't even look at me.


Tl;dr: I've lost my home, my family, my dog, and all my possessions. They were burned upon the altar of my mom's illness, and there may never be recompense for the horrid abuse I've endured.

He’s the son i had with a girl when I was 15 and she was 19. 

I never loved her because I always felt like she was trying to trap me. And she stopped taking birth control on purpose. 

I proceeded to be away from my son for 8 out of his 11 years of life because of a program when I was 17 and prison when I was 20. 

When I got out me and my son both tried to build something but it wasn’t there and we grew apart. It makes me sad but at the same time I know he has everything he needs support wise. And financial wise I do everything I can. I also still am close with his family and his mom. 

Me and him just don’t click but in a way I’m ok with it because I know he doesn’t want for anything and if he needs me I’m here.

Immuno-compromised without realising it =/,"So, I've just spent 3 weeks in isolation, going slowly more crazy each day. Just before this pandemic kicked off my wife walked out on me and took both our kids with her.

So for 3 weeks I've been unable to see my kids, and I won't lie I was pretty god damn ill for most of it, it wasn't covid-19 but it was nasty.

I finally start to feel more me and better, called the doctors Friday as due to return to work today, they asked me to come in this morning as they needed to speak to me.

I go in thinking this is just routine with me having been ill etc, only to find out I should have been locked in my house the moment lock down was announced as I take two different Corticosteroid based medications.

GP has advised me that I have next to no immune system due to the medication I am on, and as one of them is for my lungs, I would end up critically ill if I contracted covid.

I was so happy to finally be able to return to some sense of normality and go to work and possibly look to having my kids ASAP, and now I'm absolutely heart broken and panicking like mad. 

I went to the super Market on Friday as I was feeling better and desperately needed food etc as did my cat, and now I'm scared to death that I've picked up something from someone there and I'm going to end up alone in a hospital bed.

This is so so difficult cause I can't even go to a relative for support, I know I can call them, text them or whatever but I just want a god damn hug before I break down..

Sorry I just really needed to get this out and couldn't do it on usual social channels as its too personal and don't want everyone I know knowing how much is going on."
How my dad treats my mom,"So, I’ll try to keep this short but a bit of background info may be required. So my dad grew up with an abusive stepdad, so that’s his excuse for how he acts sometimes, given he’s definitely not as bad, he’s got his moments.

Anyways, I love both my parents and they love each other, however, there seems to be constant tension between them no matter what. The thing with my dad is that he believes my mother gets all the attention so he’ll often do or say things that brings her down in order for him to look superior. He might do this by talking to her like she’s stupid and say things like, “honey, I know this kind of stuff it hard for you to understand”, or he will make a big deal out of things that she’s wrong about. 

I’ve tried to talk to him about it but any time I do, he plays victim and say, “yup, it’s always dads fault”.
Honestly, I don’t know how to deal with this anymore. I know they won’t get divorced, and anytime I mention marriage counseling my mom tries to change the conversation cause she hates the conflict it brings up.
I’m at a loss :("
My parents blasting CNN right now,When everything that’s being reported is like a day old. Jesus Christ I do not need to hear it all the way from my room.
I might lose my dad soon.,"I will try to make this short but informative. Sorry in advance.
My dad hurt his knee a log time ago and about 8 years ago we decided to do replacement knee surgery for him. After this surgery his knee was never right, it got infected SEVERAL times since then and he has 5 different surgery's on that knee since then. They had to replace the parts with different material-ed parts and also surgically clean it for infection several times. -=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=- Well, he came down with a bit of a fever and flu like symptons but was able to get over that, but shortly after he couldnt put any pressure on that knee ( about a week and half ago) So my mother took him a doctor who said it was Staph infection and sent him with pain meds only (Should they have put him on antibiotics?) and told him to come back on Tuesday (this was Sunday). They mentioned nothing was wrong with kidney's or liver or even that he had any infection in his blood stream at this point. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So, when we brought him back on Tuesday (scheduled surgery to clean it out on tuesday) they found that the infection was in his blood stream and his kidney's were failing. -=-=-=-=-=-=- The doctors did the surgery on his knee to clean the infection out and were hoping this was the cause of the kidneys failing. His Kidney's continued to get worse, the only good news we got since this began was that the infection levels in his blood stream LOWERED but were not gone. -=-=-=-=-=-=-  They did Dialysis and it did not do much to help his kidney's but did remove a LOT of fluids from him. A few days later they noticed the infection back in his knee and also his livers were starting to fail .... This is where we made the hard choice to Amputate his leg. At this point we could try to clean it again and give it time, but with all the surgeries he has had to clean it and now his livers failing ... we thought it was the best idea .... 


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So he had his leg Amputated at 5pm on Xmas (last night) and since this his blood pressure has dropped dramatically - and he has excessive bleeding. They put in 3 pints of blood over night last night and this morning they transferred him to the ICU to see if they can stable him ... 

Should they have started antibiotics as soon as they figured it was Staph? Did we make the right choice to amputate? Does he even have a chance at this point? "
I don’t like working in IT!,"I’ve been working in the IT field for about 4 years now, and it’s causing a huge sense of dread for me daily. My boss is a dick, the clients are rude, and I just don’t have any passion for the work. 

What’s bothering me is the feeling of being stuck, I have to make rent and bills and obviously can’t just walk out and quit. It seems like there isn’t a way out for me unless I put some unwanted financial pressure on myself. I ask myself what I would do if I didn’t work in IT and I honestly have no clue. 

I know I’m lucky and privileged to even have a steady job, I’m just having a hard time feeling so stagnant. Being in the office day in day out is wearing me down mentally. It’s making me feel jaded and reclusive in my personal life, like I’m losing joy and genuine interest in things/people I used to care about. I’m finding myself getting angry at things that really aren’t a big deal. I just don’t know what to do and it makes me sad."
Little Sister ruined my day and possibly our relationship,"My little sister and I are very close. We always look out for each other and I would do anything for her or my other two siblings. But today made me reconsider how I'm treated when I want to help my siblings.

My sister is staying with me throughout the weekend, because my mom and her do not get along and my mom is abusive. I wanted to give her a small break away from it all and let her relax. 

Today she had an appointment for something superficial. Not medical or anything. I let her take my car after making sure she'd be back 40 minutes before I had to be at work. Mind you she would be only 5 minutes away from my apartment. She had my car for about 2 hours and about a half hour before work she finally replies saying I need to walk and get my car and ""it's not very far"". I go to where I think she was and she says she's down the street at a different salon/beauty place. It's 5 minutes until I have to be at work and I'm panicking and angry. When she picks me up I tell her to switch to the passenger seat so i can drop her off. I didn't want her to have my car. She says no and drives me to work. I didn't bother arguing because she would be 5 minutes away. But before her appointment she had asked to travel outside of town and see a stepsister we haven't seen in a while, and to go to her basketball game. After the debacle of almost being late to work I say she can't leave town. I get to work after a nearly silent car ride. 

About 2 hours into my shift she had already apologized and asked to go out of town like she asked once before. I said okay because I'd had time to cool down and stop being mad. She leaves around 4pm and I assumed she'd be back by 9pm to pick me up from work. Otherwise it would be a half hour walk through a sketchy area of town and with it being windy I didn't wanna walk. She promised she'd be on time. 9pm gets closer and she says to take an Uber so I do after waiting 15 minutes outside my workplace. Thinking she'd be right there to help me inside. At 9:15pm

She got home at 10:40 pm. She even lied about when she left. I didn't even have a key to the entrance of my building and she'd left my door unlocked. I'd have been fine with the door being unlocked, I trust the neighbors mostly but I had to sit outside my building for almost an hour and it got cold. I had assumed she would be maybe 15 minutes. I realized that... This is what I get for being a nice brother. This is what my dedication and love gets me. 

She wasn't even apologetic and didn't have the entrance key so we waited until we saw someone who lived there and she was nice enough to let us in. My sister is sending Snapchats and being aggressive with me while I'm panicking that it's nearly 11pm and I don't have a way inside. Honestly I need a break from her and I've not felt this angry at her for years. 

I've been crying all night and cold towards her. Just done at this point. Thanks for reading anyone"
4 days clean from everything and it hurts really bad,"I’m 20 years old

I’ve been struggling for years now with major depression and I spent too long masking it and hurting myself even more with drugs 

I’ve never done “hardcore”  drugs but I used to abuse prescription amphetamines until about 2.5 years ago, with a one time relapse a year ago

After I quit those, I went straight to cigarettes then vaping which kept me hooked until a few months ago now with too many failed attempts at quitting to count (thank god it’s over now)

My most recent vice was using a LOT of Kratom on a daily basis (20-30 dollars worth DAILY) and while I was using that for about 6 months I didn’t go to class and failed all of my classes and finally told my parents (I still live with them) and they basically cracked down on my behavior by having me do more chores around the house and stuff to keep me busy

They aren’t the most empathetic people, but the mood I’m feeling at this exact moment is telling me they’re only doing the best they can to be pragmatic about it

I have a wonderful girlfriend that I’m in love with and if I need to break into tears, she’s there for me to do it. It hurts me so much to put that kind of emotional weight on her, and I try to curb it when I can. 

The bottom line I guess is that it’s my fourth day clean from anything but caffeine for really the first time in years now and they’ve been some of the longest days I can remember 

Maybe this is how days are supposed to feel, maybe I’m not supposed to zone out on some substance or another for hours on end until I eventually crash and repeat the cycle. I know I have to get used to this

Even though I feel lost as hell right now, there are some good parts of me coming back that I missed for a really long time. 

I don’t get angry when customers don’t tip enough because I won’t be able to pick up kratom and vape juice after work. I see dust on my shelves and spills in the bathroom sink. I can lay down and listen to music without having to have my hands busy at the wheel of my car or playing a video game. 

These moods come and go on a minute by minute basis, and have been doing so while I’ve been writing this. I think it’s going to get better. I think I’m in an upswing. My cravings scare me but I have to push forward. 

If anyone out there took the time to read this, thank you so much. I haven’t written anything this long in a very long time, so I’m sorry if it makes no sense."
I saw a cruel comment receive 700 upvoted and gold.,"I just saw [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2bzj92/fie_friedrichsentook_her_two_years_to_lose_150/) about a truly stunning weight loss. I saved the picture to use for motivation, clicked to the comments, and saw the top comment (no longer top, but still gilded) about how ""her cooter must look terrifying"", followed by other similar jokes.

I have only about half the weight to lose that she did and I won't look half as good when I'm done. I actually managed to stick to my diet the past few days, but honestly, I just want to cry. All I can think is how the world is still going to find me disgusting IF I can even manage to get the weight off. 

Thanks for listening."

my friends all have friends who theyd rather be with.

everyone i thought i was close with are more  more outgoing and have more (closer, better) friends.

i just ride along when i can

i dont hug anyone hello or goodbye

they get into groups and im just left inbetween

My dad is trying his best to screw me over [update],"Hey all!

5 months ago I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1ki6le/my_dad_is_trying_his_best_to_screw_me_over/) thread. The TL;DR version was that my parents billed a lot of stuff on credit cards I didn't know about and refused to pay it back. I paid it all off myself, and later went after them in court. My Mom and I settled out of court, and she's paid me back 5k/5.2k she owes me. 

My Dad didn't believe he owed me any, so I had to take him to court. The first court case I won, and received a judgement in the amount of $3,600 dollars. Unfortunately, I moved from California to Seattle 3 days after that judgement was entered for my job. He had 30 days to pay me in full, forge a payment plan with the court, or file an appeal. On the 30th day, he filed an appeal. 

That means I had to go back to California to represent my case all over again in front of another judge, in 4 months. Well, that court date was Jan 17th, and I just found out today I won again. The judge even comped me $127 for airfare. Now he once again has 30 days to pay me, and I don't think he can file another appeal. 

But who knows, he might try to find some new way to screw me over. "
"Girlfriend of 3.5 years broke up with me, we live together still","My girlfriend broke up with me a week ago. We had been a long distance all throughout highschool and she moved in with me while we went to college. I thought I was going to spend my life with this girl. But apparently she needed independence, and to grow, and to hang out(and fool around) with a guy who has a car. 

I don't know what to do. I helped her through so much. I saved her life. We were going to grow old together. I had my problems, I'm a bit of an introvert, and I spent most of high school at home, talking with her(lest she get upset) and didn't really learn how to fun outside easily. She had her problems, such as huge jealousy issues(which I overlooked) and anxiety

she still treats me the same(except in public, which I'm not allowed to show her any sort of romantic affection, but that fucking ass hat is), seems to be hurt that i'm hurting so much,
but that doesn't really change her plans much(aka hang out
with this fuckwit as much as she can)

i'm so broken, i don't know what to do, she was everything to me, she tells me I need a ""life"" outside her but I did have one, how is that supposed to change how crippling this is to me? i live with her
so i can't avoid her, when i'm away from her i break down, i've missed class because I can't get myself out of bed in the morning,
i've broken down at least once a day, i'm still a total sucker for her
and baby her when she's at home because I'm a fucking dope, right?

i'm so lost. i've tried to start improving myself(finally getting my license, which is due to insurance issues more than lack of want; and starting to diet and work out), do more things with her, but I
thought she'd understand that with my full time schooling(i'm at school 75% of the week) it's hard for me, especially with our conflicting schedules

I'm just, so so lost, i can't enjoy anything, i enjoyed breaking bad,
but i'm all caught up and there's nothing to see until sunday, I'm an absolute wreck, i can't even tell my mom, because I made promises to my ex that when she moved in with me that i'd make sure if we broke up her housing wouldn't be compromised because of it, and i know if my mom knew her rent would be jacked up, and the whole house would be tense, etc.

i'm just stuck. and it's impossible. i don't think i'd ever find
a girl i felt so perfect with, and i'm stuck like this in a nightmare
that I never wake up from, just resume the next day

edit: thank you so much guys. I really appreciate all that's been said. Those sayings she's abusive, maybe she is, but I don't think I've painted the full picture regardless, but it doesn't really matter--the advice is still valid nonetheless, and I'm taking it all to heart. Thank you again for helping me when I was really at the end of my ropes"
My mom is worse than a bill collector.,"Let me preface this by saying that for the past year or so I have been slowly, slowly working my way out of a mountain of debt.  I work in fast food while I am finishing up school, and money is unbelievably tight.  I'm not on any public assistance, and my paychecks only average about $430 every two weeks.

About a month ago, my mom was listening to me complain about how I couldn't afford to renew my license plates and I didn't know where I was going to get the money to do it.  My mom makes great money (If I remember correctly, 65K last year, and she has been working full time this year) She offered to loan me $200, which I was extremely grateful for.  However, ever since then, she will not quit hounding me about it.  Every time I have spoken to her on the phone it has ended in me bawling my eyes out, or her hanging up on me.  

She keeps saying ""Well I need that money, lolacherokee! I am so broke, your siblings need school supplies, etc."" This just pisses me the fuck off because just last week I went out with her while she shopped for new beds and mattresses for my brother and sister.  She told the salesman that her budget was 5K, and she was going to write a check.  She didn't end up finding anything she liked, so we left.  Just a few days ago she took one of my sisters to the mall, and she called me saying she had ""only"" spent $300 dollars.  

My mom grew up poor.  She knows how hard it is to make ends meet.  But she worked hard, was a frugal person, saved, and now she has something to show for it.  I can appreciate that.  However, I don't think she realizes that $200 she can make in five and a half hours takes me twenty three hours to earn.  

The icing on the cake today was when I told her I was hungry, she said ""well if you can afford to buy groceries, you can afford to pay me back.""  Actually mom, I have only been eating my free meals at work the past four days because I only had money for either me to eat or my cats, so I bought cat food.

Anyway, thats what is bothering me reddit.  Thanks for listening."
I haven’t been feeling myself at all lately,"Ever since this pandemic started I haven’t been feeling the same, I feel like I lost all my wits and my creativity. I don’t feel like the funny guy anymore, I feel so dry sometimes when I talk to people I used to always enjoy talking to. I’ve been depressed and having anxiety for most of the quarantine. I haven’t really been doing the things I loved most and watching the shows and funny youtubers I’d always binge watch. 

I feel really insecure cause I feel like I have nothing to bring to the table when I’m with my FaceTime group I always end up staying quiet sometimes. Whenever I try to be funny now it just sounds stupid, I’m not sure where to go from this point and how to solve this exactly. I can’t really think straight, I wanna be myself again."
Pissed off a well known guitarist. Now I feel bad,"Hi everyone.

So a few days ago I messaged a well known guitar shredder about some tips, and whether they offered lessons.  They do. They did say they didn't teach beginners.  We discussed my ability and rates etc.  The rates weren't too bad.  So I said I was interested and would let them know. 

&#x200B;

Here's the thing.  I have Cerebral Palsy, I play guitar overhanded with two fingers.  I've been playing for ten years but I'm really not that great.  So I figured scheduling a lesson would be a waste of their time.  I told them I really needed more beginner theory type stuff and not the skills of a shred master.  They basically said: ""Fine, I teach beginner theory but if you don't want to learn from me, go ahead and take lessons with somebody else."" 

I wasn't sure how to interpret that tonally, so I thanked them for understanding.  They said (paraphrasing): ""Yea, I love having conversations like this all day long.""

&#x200B;

On one hand I feel like crap because I annoyed a guitarist I respected.  Maybe I did waste their time overall.  On the other hand, I had the best of intentions, and what time?  It was a conversation over FB Messenger, it's not as if we scheduled a lesson or anything, and they said no novices.

I'm just super bummed.  How should I feel here?  

&#x200B;

Thanks."
Please Read. I don't know what to do.,"This is a throwaway account just to get it out of the way.

sorry if this is all over the place I genuinely apologize in advance

So currently I live in a condo with my mom and dad (im 15). And about to move to a ranch where they own 30 acres of land to ""prepare"" for a apocalypse or something like that (they're conspiracy theorists like heavy conspiracy theorists). and recently we took a 2 week road trip there so we know what to do when we fully get there. but thats the issue. We'll be in the middle of nowhere completely disconnected from society and I dont want to. and the main reason for that is because I haven't been in school for this entire school year. Im seriously worried about my education but both my parents think school is complete bullshit. and to an extent I agree, but its 10000x easier to get a job if you have a high school diploma rather than to not have passed the 8th grade. And at first I thought i'd just do online schooling and it'll be fine. but we dont have enough power in the house. We have 3 tiny solar panels that barely make it through the whole day. so trying to run a computer with it is next to impossible. I dont know what to do at this point. Its really stressing me out and i've tried talking to them about letting me live with a relative (who i've asked if anything happens i can stay with her and im very close with her), but nothing. It's almost like talking to a brick wall sometimes. Only thing i've thought of was to get cps involved but that could end them up in jail which I definitely don't want to happen. Please reply with any ideas you might have."
"We unintentionally lose touch with old friends we used to speak with regularly at some point. Being straight of uni - I've experienced this and mostly due to ""business / laziness"". Friends and I are working on an app to solve this - would love to hear if you think its useful :)", [nurtureapp.co.uk](https://nurtureapp.co.uk/) \- any feedback / suggestions on how we can encourage people to stay in touch with their meaningful relations (non day-to-day) would be awesome!
I think I'm a sociopath," 

\- I always had ""friends"" but I never really truly connected to someone, and I always felt that I had to hide my true self from them (or they would think I'm insane)

\- I have a very nihilistic and materialistic worldview, I evaluate everything in darwinian terms, survival of the fittest

\- I stole a toy from a ""friend"" when I was a child

\- I manipulated my cosein into swaping toys (his toy was clearly superior)

\- I manipulated a girlfriend into getting breast enlargement surgery (I prefer big tits)

\- I have sex mostly with prostitutes. A lot of men say they would not enjoy it because the prostitute doesn't like them / is not attracted to them. For me this point was never important, basically I don't care as long as I get what I want (sex with a hot women)

\- I see most people as dumb and brainwashed sheep who cannot act rationaly

\- I like my family members and don't want harm to happen to them, but I also think a lot how useful they are to me (e.g. I think ""I should play nice with my parents or they might disinherit me"")

\- I'm very introverted (INTP type personality), I almost never think about people, I only care about abstract stuff like the technloogical singulartiy, AI, stuff like that.

\- When I had a girlfriend I always evaluated them on very shallow criteria (how hot they are, how good the sex is with them)

\- I have a high IQ (mensa measured 138)

I was depressed for a big part of my life, mostly because I could not get hot girls to like me.

But last year I got a huge raise, and now I can afford to buy sex pretty much whenever I want.

This was the first time I felt really joyful and happy, and I also felt like I reached my ""deserved"" space in society, because I clearly see myself as superior to most people

It was the first time I got feelings of ""Man it's good to be me. Thank god I'm not this guy""

This was also the first time I got feelings of ""ok so I was depressed because I'm a wolf who tried to fit into a herd of sheep. I should not try to fit in, I have nothing to learn from those idiots""

But I also have some empathic moments, when I was sad about the suffering in the world, I also donated some money. But these moments are extremly infrequent, like once a year.

I can enjoy the company of some people a lot, but I think it's more the mental stimulation they provide to me that I value, I'm not really sure.

I'm also very risk averse, and I have read that most sociopaths are also risk takers.

But I don't see a point in taking risks when there is no possible reward.

So I'm not sure about that one.

I also observed that I act very differently if I know that I'm watched by other people or not. When I'm watched I will do what I think is socially accepted, but when I'm sure I'm not watched I will just do what I think is best for me.

I often ask myself hypothetical questions like ""if you could steal a lot of money from someone and you would be 100% sure you could get away with it, would you do it ?"" and the answer is always yes.

But often, I just think everyone is like me, and they all just pretend to be social and empathic. I mean how can you be sure?

Do you think I'm one? Or just a very introverted guy?

&#x200B;

Should I try to get an official diagnosis?

But I think if it turns out to be true it might be dangerous that someone would know about it?"
"I just don't see the point in continuing to put a Fuckton of effort into remaining alive in a world not made for me, in a society not made for me, with no possibility of things ever being any better than they are now, and plenty of opportunity to get worse.","I'm very severely autistic. I have very severe sensory issues, and a number of other physical impairments and difficulties. My neuropsychologist and doctors are somewhat shocked that I can speak at all, I am lucky in that I am extremely gifted, I have an IQ of 167, and I use my excess intellectual ability to compensate enough to speak, and process sensory information manually. I am in constant pain. Everything necessary for life is extraordinarily painful to me, food and water especially. 

I am in a gray area as far as competency, intellectually I am, but emotionally/mentally/socially I'm essentially a toddler. 

I am totally disabled, and on SSI. I get ~$700 a month. I will never get more in terms of monetary value, as cost of living increases never keep up with actual price increases. The poverty I live in now can only ever get worse.

I am a child abuse survivor, with PTSD. I can't speak at all in front of doctors, or agents of any bureaucracy/the gov/other authority. It would be incredibly easy to have me ruled incompetent, and my parents want me back. I can't use hud or section 8 or other things that might help, because I can't have a place in my name or any listed address. I have to be legally homeless, and rent rooms from unstable people on craigslist because that's the only way they can't find me. 

Psychiatrists and mental health professionals at my income level can't differentiate autism from serious mental illnesses that absolutely require medications that are literally worse than death for me. I went through that as a kid, it was terrible, and it takes a lot of effort and assistance of someone I can't count on being able to help forever to keep getting my SSI and regular health care while avoiding being forcibly misdiagnosed and forced on such medications. It's terrifying to know that all it takes is one doctor visit gone wrong and an official recommendation to lose everything for refusal of medical treatment. I'd love it If I could take medications and have it help with what it's supposed to, but autism is a brain wiring difference, not a chemical difference, and even where I have potential chemical issues, medication doesn't affect me in a predictable way. I've been on enough different kinds for enough years (30+ kinds and over a decade) to know it's not a viable way to deal with my issues without some serious medical advancements and better educated doctors. I'm limited to coping skills and the usual sensory processing disorder items: weighted blankets, hearing protection, fidget toys, etc.

My life is constant crisis, trying to find a place to stay, trying to afford enough food, trying to leap through the hoops necessary to keep my SSI and medical care. No security, no hope for anything better or any improvement at all, only to survive this next emergency and wait for the next one.

I have enjoyable moments, but I fail to see how they are worth continuing through all this, waiting for the emergency I can't escape, to be trapped by my parents or the mental health system in a hell worse than death. Objectively, I can't see any use, purpose, or reason why I should continue to exist through this if this is the best it can get, especially considering just how easy and likely it is to get so much worse. 

I'm not suicidal, it's one of those things that accompanies my lack of ability to process time, and future consequences in a typical way, I've never been able to bring myself to trade current discomfort for future relief. I've no plan, I'm Not a danger to myself or others. It's obvious, however, that this isn't a healthy way to think, and my self care is suffering considerably. I can't seek professional help for the reasons listed above. Reddits taught me 90% of the coping skills and mental tricks that get me through a day, so It just seemed logical to try and talk here.  I only have WiFi on Saturdays and Mondays, so if I don't respond right away, I will.

My cancer came back.,"I was diagnosed with osteosarcoma at 14. I did 9 months of chemo, with a limb sparing surgery in the middle. Less than two years later, I had two thoracotomies to remove metastatic tumors from my lungs and another two a year later to remove more. I then did an experimental treatment but it came back again in the subcutaneous tissue in my abdomen. I was cancer free for about 3.5 years and another tumor was found in my lung last month. I had the surgery again to remove the tumor. 



I am in a ton of pain, and I was told they don't think they got it all. I'm going to have to do radiation in a few weeks. I thought it was all finished with. 3.5 years clear was a huge deal but it seems so small now. 



I have an amazing fiancé who has stood by me through this most recent surgery. I want to grow old with him, but I don't think that is going to happen. 



We're struggling with money right now because we were fired from our jobs (working at my fathers bar) for having to miss work. His parents have told us not to worry about money during this time, but we also don't know how to ask them for help. A donation page was set up for me and originally got quite a few donations (close to $400) but the donations have stopped coming in. 



I try so hard to be strong for everyone, and everyone thinks I'm okay with it because I've done it before so many times but really that just makes it worse. It's never going to stop, at least not until it kills me. 



I am hurting, broke, sad, and scared. I just needed to share this."
I just had to kill a baby rabbit,My dog just caught a baby rabbit but instead of killing it he just injured it and left it for dead. I'm sure he just wanted to play with it and was surprised when he actually caught it and didn't know what to do. I couldn't just let it lay there and suffer so I did one of the hardest things I've done; I took a big brick and killed him and now I feel terrible. I can't stop picturing the poor mom looking for her tiny baby :(
I set my roommate and best friend on fire.,"We had a fire in our back yard and I thought it would be cool to pour some gas on it. It flared up and went straight for her, now she has third degree burns on her hand and it singed a lot of her hair pretty bad. I am going to pay for the hospital bill, and a new hair cut. "
Am I overreacting or was I actually sexually harassed?,"So first of all, I'm a guy. 

Here's the story:

End of last semester, beginning of summer. I go over to my friend's house to hang out, his neighbors are there. I guess I will call the P and N. So they are pretty drunk, and my friend T is hooking up with N. Sooner or later, P asks me to hook up with her, and I decline politely. I was not attracted to her in least as far as looks or personality. 

Eventually I fall asleep when things quiet down a little, and before I know it, I wake up to her kissing my mouth. I left because it made me pretty damn uncomfortable and honestly I was offended. 

Well P and N came back tonight to visit, and I went over to hang out with my friend T and his roommates, not knowing she was there. I immediately left without acknowledging P or N, and immediately I got texts asking what was wrong. I told T's roommate what happened and he said it wasn't a big deal, I was blowing it out of proportion, etc. and that I was being rude but honestly it made me very upset seeing her again. 

It's not like I'm afraid of girls or anything, I am usually open to trying new things and giving girl's I'm not necessarily attracted to the benefit of the doubt, but there is a clear line drawn when I say no. 

Am I overreacting? Are T and his roommates right?"
"Went to see a GP about depression, he told I'd get over it because I'm young","It's long term and comes and goes, and I've tentatively narrowed it down to either seasonal affective depression or dysthymia.

I feel like I've hit an all-time low right now. I have strong doubts to the quality of my future and post-graduate opportunities (if there even are any, given the glorious state of our economy right now), and then there's just the strong feelings of inadequacy and loneliness where I wonder why I'm still trying.

For background info: I thought I was doing better this year; concentrating on final year at university, surrounded by a good group of friends, working up the courage to quit the part-time job I hate. But then all of the negativity just hits me again, and it's just dragging me down slowly. I'd say objectively I have a good life, but this is something that's hard for me to bring up to my friends when they're under the impression I'm well-adjusted and happy. Because I'm not. But it's so much easier to fly under the radar with a smile on your face. And when I am genuinely and inexplicably sad, I get dismissed as moody, because there is no easy way to describe why I feel so pathetic and doubtful in my own abilities, and how the sense of uselessness is so crushing. 

I need validation in my own existence. I know what I need is someone to love me but I'm so far into the friend-zone I don't even get signal. I've tried, but maybe I should just pledge abstinence. It's not like I'll be missing out on any.

I just need to know that I'm not alone in feeling like a shitty human being. "
I'm going deaf.,"I have been diagnosed with a ""retracted eardrum"", which could mean Patulous Eustachian tube or Costen's syndrome, according to various doctors. I have an appointment to get a referral to a specialist next week.

It's a very frustrating experience. It feels like there's water in my ears, permanently, I constantly feel air whistling through my ears. I can't hear myself talk and I can barely carry a conversation. Sometimes it goes away for a few days at a time, and I feel normal. Then it comes back."
"This is so stupid, but I never get compliments.","I'm going to try not to be humblebraggy here, I'm sorry. I'm an overwhelmingly average person, on the whole. I take care of myself, I dress simply but I'm well kempt. Looks wise I'm slender and in shape and maybe a 6, but I try and present myself well and I have good hygiene. I've been seriously overworked the last few months and I've had a few comments on my appearance. You look tired, you look like a zombie, etc. It made me realize no one ever says anything complimentary about me...ever. My coworkers are great people and I've noticed they tell each other nice things constantly. Your hair looks good, that color looks great on you, and so on. But not me? And yes, I do say nice things about and to them. Not just since I've noticed this, I just always have because I know it can make someone else's day.

So do I...not look nice? Am I living in an anti compliment bubble? Is this on me or on them? I'm trying not to feel hurt by something so petty when everything else is falling apart."
I broke my first plant I'm growing,I just planted them and prepared everything. I'm still tilling soil for other plants and I was moving some dirt and it dropped on my plant and broke it. I'm just really sad now
Everything keeps getting worse,"Since about mid-February I've left my job every single day in tears. In February I was sexually harassed (it was actually assault) at my job twice. I went to management, as we do not have an HR department and the first time they told me they didn't believe. The second time I fortunately had a witness. We supposedly have a ""zero tolerance"" sexual harassment policy, but this kid only got suspended for 2 days.

Things seemed to be looking up at the beginning of March, I got a nice promotion, the only catch was I had to leave 1st shift job and go to 3rd shift, which is the shift the assailant is on. I felt safe though, because I was in as locked lab. Ever since I made this complaint though management has treated me like dirt and 1 week after getting out of training as a lab tech, they decided I wasn't ""fast enough"" so they removed me and took away my raise. Now they've filled my position on 1st shift, so they want me to go into regular production with the man that sexually assaulted me!!

I told management I will absolutely not work with him and they can't make me. I don't know what to do. I want to quit so bad. The thought of going there tomorrow is making me physically sick. I wanna put my 2 wls in, my family keeps telling me to quit, but I'm the mother of 2 girls (ages 2&3) and I can't just not feed my family. I could h as very been an awesome lab technician if they would have gave me like another wk or so. 

I'm just devastated, my soul is crushed. I feel like a huge failure. I'm losing ""friends"" left and right. I really needed to vent because honestly I wanna eat these 90 xanax and take a nice long dirt nap. I wish I had the ability to just ""be a duck"" and let this all this roll off my back, but I can't. I feel everything on such a deep level. I wish someone had a crystal ball to be able to tell me what's going to happen, because I can't live through this anymore."
I don't know what happened,"Lately, I have been thinking about something that when down in my early childhood. I was maybe 4 or 5.  One of my father's friends got close to me.  I mean we were close.  He treated me very kindly according to all the memories I have of him. But, thinking about the situation as an adult, it seems very questionable.  He was in his mid-20's.  He gave me a wedding ring and a puppy, then lift my life forever. 

The ring wasn't just some cheap trash.  It was his wedding ring.  After giving it to me,  my mother took it and combined it with two of hers to make a third.  If it weren't for this, I would have completely blocked him out of my memory. 

The night he gave me the ring, we were sitting in his truck in the woods.  At night! A four year old and a twenty something divorced man. I remember it being so dark that I couldn't see his face.  

This is the memory that came back to me.  I then thought, ""Who was that man?"" The first person I asked out laud was my mother.  She had NO memory of him.  She had never meet him. It took hours for the sister that is just a few years older than me to pop the name out.  

I also remember playing around with him in his home with no one else there.  

This memories just seem very questionable.  Looking back at my life, he had an impact on my development either positively or negatively. 

As a child, I was always very unhappy.   At a very early age, I started thinking about suicide.  This was about the age of 8-ish. I became overly hard on myself.  It felted as though I would not be able to improve my situation.  The world around me seemed as though it were a game I wasn't meant to play. I retreated for social situations whenever possible. My farther had a very absent method of parenting."
I'll never confide in anyone anymore,"First, I apologize if the text is unclear at some parts but English is not my native language. Lately I've been feeling horrible. There is nothing I can enjoy anymore, I have a brain fog, etc. I told this to my father bc I thought I could trust him but I was wrong. He made a really big deal about what I said to him and told everyone in our family about it. He started yelling at me and telling me that I have nothing to be depressed about and blamed everything on my friends and mobile phone. Now there is a chaos in my house again and everything is my fault. I just wish I never said anything and I don't think I'll ever be able to confide in anyone anymore."
I've let myself down,I was expecting myself to be a lot better than I am at my age now. I did nothing but fail.
I’m on vacation but I am miserable,"I am on vacation with my parents, sisters and little brother. My parents speed planned this. They bought tickets in November and barely planned. We’ve had cozy vacations before but we also have shit ones like this where there was no planning and you wish you were home the whole time. My sister is arriving later tonight and my other sister is arriving tomorrow. We are a big family. Vacations like this are usually miserable due to us squishing into suites meant for smaller families. In the suite we are in now, there are 2 bedrooms making a total of 3 beds. There is also a 4th bed in the living room couch. My parents packed a blow up bed. I have no idea where it’s going to fit. I’m stepping over everyone’s stuff trying to get my clothes and shit. Its very cramped. The resort only allows 5 devices to be on WiFi at once and there are 6 of us. It’s a problem. I don’t like being stuffed in such close corners by my family. My sisters go to bed at like 9pm, and so does my little brother because they make him(he’s 15). At night I like to stay up and relax and browse reddit, or do some writing for blogs I work for. I can’t. We are in Las Vegas but no one in my family drinks. So I have no idea why we’re here. My parents say they want to see a Michael Jackson show but it would bore me to tears. I am the only person in my family that wears makeup, my mom and my sisters don’t wear any so I feel nothing like them. I’m the girly one that got sent to boarding school for high school after skipping class to hang out with boys at the private school across the street. That was years ago, I am a writer now and have a college degree. One of my sisters went to an ivy and has a stick up her butt every time you talk to her. I don’t like spending time with them, they’re so Christian and saintly it makes me want to shoot myself. I hate being here. I’d really rather not be here. I did not want to come. We are at one of those family centered resorts really made for families with little kids where they show kids movies and have board games and “hot chocolate socials”. There is no bar and the indoor pool/jacuzzis close at 8pm. I am dying. I wouldnt drink or smoke around them any way, I just never would, it would give them heart attacks. They would die of shock. Hate my square ass family (minus my little brother, its not his fault)"

I'm Muslim and queer and I hate my life,"I was raised in a super conservative homophobic environment till high school, and couldn't find the courage to come out in college, mostly b/c many of my friends were Muslim and it's extremely taboo to express a sexuality that isn't heterosexual. I came out to a couple girls, but couldn't tell any of my male friends because I didn't want them to think I was coming on to them.

Keeping this secret from everyone is taking a toll on me mentally. My self esteem and confidence are nonexistent. I'm struggling with anxiety and depression, and I feel that when I'm around friends--especially male friends--I'm hyper sensitive to how i'm behaving and making sure I don't do anything society would associate with being gay. And when I find myself attracted to one of my guy friends, it never ends well. I want to have male friendships. I just want to live a normal life, and I've tried talking to counselors about this but it's just so embarrassing. 

I don't know what else to say. I'm exhausted of this, and I'm nearing the end of the rope. Please help :("
I'm supposed to get married next month and I really think I should call it off,"she and i have been together for 12yrs.  3 kids.  i never really wanted to marry her but i figured, hey, what the heck. 3 kids, 12yrs, etc etc.
Last night my longtime good friend called and asked if he, his wife and 3 children could use my studio bathroom to take showers, get cleaned up, etc.  They have been looking for a place, staying between a tent, in their car and hotels here and there.  I will say yes to this, what is to me a simple request, 100 times out of 100.  I texted my lady about what I was going to do, that it wouldnt take up more than an hour and whats more she wouldnt even see or hear them as this was in a back studio, seperate from the house.
Later that evening when they showed up, my woman flew into a rage, yelling, screaming, mocking me with taunts of 'why dont i just invite all the homeless people in and let them free load.""  
Mind you, this was for a shower....in a seperate building...completely out of sight and away from her eyes/ears.
She then really went into overdrive, threw her wedding ring at me, lost it behind the fridge or somewhere, who knows.
Then she wanted to slap my face, i just let her.  my adrenaline prevented me from feeling any of it.  Then she called her mom to get her, told the kids, all who witnessed this juvenile outburst that she wouldnt be living there anymore.
The wedding is in 32days.  I only have 6 people flying in, the rest are local.  I would gladly cancel this thing today, refund the 6 pklane tickets and 3 hotel rooms and let the chips fall where they may."
All my friend's phone don't work,"I call, text, message you guys all the time and never get a response. I guess your phones don't work, that's what I keep telling myself..."
My teacher is horrible.,"I'm taking an Abnormal Psychology class at a local community college and the teacher is terrible. I honestly feel like I'm being tricked because of how bad he is. It's an hour and twenty minutes two days a week and I feel trapped.

I get that every teacher has their own teaching style but this seems borderline ""malpractice,"" if such a thing is possible in schools. He sits in the front of the room and tells us stories of people he's treated as a psychotherapist. He sometimes neglects to tell us what psychological disorders (aka the point of an Abnormal Psychology class) these people have and instead tells us about one particular thing they do. Then he has us do an assignment on it.

He told us about a mildly retarded (FAS) girl who was orphaned at 4 years because her mother essentially drank herself to death. No one knew about the mother dying for at least a couple of days and the police only found out because the neighbors reported a weird smell and said they hadn't seen the mother or daughter for a few days. Little girl had been in the house with her dead mother while she decomposed. Cops came in and she was taken to an institution, where my teacher was eventually assigned to be her therapist. When he asked her about when her mother died, she said the police came to arrest her because she killed her mother. She thought she did it and nobody told her otherwise for several years. When she aged out of the program she was in she said ""no one will adopt me because I'm retarded and ugly."" Our teacher then said ""you know what? She was right. She still hasn't been adopted. She's in [name of notorious institution in L.A. that's well known for being a hell hole] and still hasn't been adopted and she never will be.""

He didn't talk about her psychological state at all. He didn't tell us if she had any kind of psychosis, he didn't say if she'd been diagnosed with PTSD, he didn't even say if she was depressed. All I know about this girl's mental state is that she had Fetal Alcohol syndrome.

He then told us to ""come up with a treatment plan"" for her. Didn't tell us how, just gave us the assignment. I'm a psychology student and I have a LOT of psychology classes under my belt, but I have NEVER been told to come up with a treatment plan. He followed that up with ""I guarantee you that no matter what you write, that program does not exist. There is no program for children like her.""

Then why the fuck do you want us to do it? Why would you give us an assignment, not tell us how to do it, then tell us it doesn't matter? When I asked him about it he got really flustered and eventually said something like ""I want you to get used to writing treatment plans.""

I'm not learning anything. I haven't learned anything scientific, I haven't learned anything empirical, I haven't learned anything about any psychological disorder other than anecdotal stories about people who just happen to have these disorders. We learn about a particular person who has been diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic and they went and killed a guy with an axe, and then we talk about the guy and not the paranoid schizophrenia.

I tried talking to him about it and the conversation made me really uncomfortable. I asked him for a class syllabus (he didn't give us one even though he's required to) and he gave it to me just now. The date on it is 2010. He hasn't updated it in four years and there's nothing in it about what we're going to do as a class.

This is incredibly frustrating. I don't know whether to just put up with it, tell an administrator, drop the class... I'm at a loss. I guess writing this didn't make up my mind at all, but it feels good to talk about. Thanks for reading it."
Just got back from the desert and...,"I was recently deployed and estactic that I managed to get back to the states with time to take leave for Christmas so I could be home for the holidays this year. However on returning to my duty station I found that my car is having transmission issues. It's in the shop currently getting an ATF flush but if that doesn't work I'll have to rebuild the transmission. Between all the gifts I've already bought for my family and paying off all of my debt with my deployment money I don't have the money to fix my transmission and still go home. I'm used to not going home for holidays but this Christmas I was so sure I was going home and now I'm starting to have doubts that I will be able to. When I was in the desert I had this thought of surprising my dad at work when I got into town but now that just doesn't seem possible. I don't know what I'm gonna do if the ATF flush doesn't work.

Edit: Words."
"I talked to a femalre friend of mine while I was On LSD and now feel a deeper emotional connection than Ive ever felt with anybody. I may be in love, yet I have a girlfriend.","I cant stop thinking of my friend (lets call her M). We talked on the phone for hours and I realised while tripping that she is the most beautiful soul I have ever met. She has a darkish past of being abused like me, but its only made her a person who has more empathy and compassion than any ive met, and its made her very very mature and strong. Unlike her my abused past has just led me into drug addiction, mental issues, severe anxiety and depression and a lot more. 

Shes like if I did my life the right way with the same cards that id been dealt. Shes amazing, she is so fucking smart, beautiful, WISE. I dont even see her sexually, i just want to hug her, i want to be sober now, not for her but because she just helped open my eyes that way. Shes spent hours talking to me about life and philosphy and talks to me when im depressed and is always so sweet to me and wants to help me in any way to get sober and ugh shes just so perfect in that way! She cares about me in a way ive never felt!

I know her little brother too and have been keeping him out of trouble! She knows this too! He recently tried buying coke ( hes never done a drug besides beer) but since i know all the dealers at school i made sure he didnt get any. I convinced him he didnt want to go down that route, because i did. I give him life advice, help him in the weightroom and just try to be the best role model i can.

I relapsed 5 days ago on speed and actially havent been sober since and ended up crying on ber shoulder and it was just...okay. Like it wasnt embarrasing or anything! I felt safe in her arms, and i feel safe talking to her.

Meanwhile she has had issues recently with her dad and ive offered her anything she needs, being the devil i am i told her she can rest assured she is safe, even if i have to see the dad myself. Weve gone driving around the town together and she is just such a good girl! Shes so innocent i just love it. When we talked on the phone and i told her my beliefs about enlightenment and awakening in life (think buddhism and also alot of what david foster wallace talked a out) she kept saying how amazinf and smart I am. I felt so appreciated!

I'm breaking up with my girlfriend not for this girl, but because I realised i only settled for my gf, and she doesnt give me these good feelings. Whats bothering me is how my friend M probably doesnt feel as strongly as i do even though we both share the most intimate (not just sexual intimate) details of our lives with eachother."
My mom passed away from cancer a month and nine days ago,"I've posted about this on reddit before but it's keeping me up tonight. It's going to be really long, not expecting anyone to necessarily read it all.

My mom raised me as a single mother and we had no other family close by until my dad moved back when I was eleven, but he didn't live with us so it always felt like it was just me and her. She was diagnosed with stage 4 vulvar cancer when I was 16, and fought that for awhile with chemo, radiation, and talks of one of the most radical surgeries you can possibly get, until she was diagnosed with lung cancer (one lung so bad it was pretty much completely gone). I guess five months ago... wow, it feels much longer than that, like it feels like it's been much longer than a month and some change since her death... but I guess about five months ago she went into a hospice facility and was categorized as ""days to weeks"" left.

Before she went into hospice it was only me caring for her once she was bedridden but it was really easy until she started getting more and more confused. The cancer had probably spread to her brain or if not it was finally the meds taking their toll on her (vulvar cancer is one of the most painful cancers you can get, the amount of morphine and other drugs she was on was absolutely insane, but she was still in constant, often excruciating pain). That's when I first started feeling alone, despite having people that cared for me (especially my dad, my aunt in Florida, etc), because it no longer felt like I had my mom.

When she went into hospice it was one of the hardest days of my life, definitely harder than the day she was diagnosed and I can't begin to imagine how hard it was for her. She never wanted that (she saw her mom go into a nursing home), and I didn't want it for her either, it was actually a total shock to me when I was, essentially, informed of the decision. I'd talked with the hospice people extensively one day, and the next day they woke me up by calling and saying she needed to be moved into a facility that day when everyone had left things on a completely different note as far as I knew. They were certain she needed the round the clock care and a better environment, and I couldn't really argue with them. My mom had no idea either, and telling her is an experience I've almost completely blocked out mentally, I remember the rest of the day pretty clearly but the only thing about that I recall is me trying not to cry and her crying and being confused.

It turned out to be the best thing that could have happened though. The residence was less than a year old, held thirty total residents but was only opened up for ten or so at the time and the waiting list was already ridiculously long, but one of the reasons the hospice people were so hasty is because me being a minor taking care of her apparently shot us to the top of the pile, at least according to one of the nurses that raved about it. It was absolutely wonderful and very comforting in every aspect. The hospital beds didn't look like hospital beds, they were furnished with wood and whatnot, the halls and rooms felt very ""home-y"", and the staff were fucking AMAZING, a lovely fireplace area, a beautiful courtyard, etc. Not at all like the nursing home I remember my grandma being put in, with its white walls and hospital vibe. Or like any of the horror stories you hear on the news sometimes about the less than caring staff at some of these facilities. Almost everyone went well above and beyond for both my mom and me, and she hit it off with a lot of them immediately, some of them genuinely becoming friends to us.

In there she had good and bad phases. Sometimes she'd be confused for weeks at a time, not remembering any of it, other times she'd just be herself. After awhile she began having phases where for days up to a week at a time she'd be passed out 24/7. But she lasted a little over four months in there, through several times the doctors had re-categorized her as ""hours to days"" and we were prepared for her passing, honestly stunning everyone. She really wanted to see me turn 18. It didn't seem entirely likely or unlikely, but I was still mentally prepared for it to not happen, the weeks leading up to it she had had one of her worst spells yet. My birthday was May 26th and she lived until July 18th. She was even in such a good, clear phase mentally that despite her body actively failing her, she managed to orchestrate a surprise party for me.

But after that she kept having longer bad phases that got worse and worse. She'd lost a lot of weight from the beginning, going through the chemo, she was down to around 100 from 135 or so but at the very end she rapidly lost weight. She stopped eating entirely, rarely being able to handle shakes/smoothies, was unable to take her meds, etc. Right before she passed she was easily down to 70 lbs and I remember going to see her one night with my dad and walking in the room and looking at her and only being able to think ""oh my god, she just looks like death"". Before then it had been getting harder and harder to see her but that night I could only stand to stay 15-20 minutes and that was only because we wanted to hit her morphine pump for her again (it was on a timer and it was given to her so she could hit it as needed on top of her regular meds, but at that time she was unable to, completely out of it/unresponsive). A piece of her ear looked like it had just gotten sliced off with an extremely sharp blade somehow, but her skin was so degraded from the cancer by that point the nurses could hardly move her around the bed without it literally... well I'm not going to finish that thought. I took a picture of her for some reason, because I just couldn't believe it, how bad she looked. I was going to send it to my aunt but I decided against it, she didn't need to see her that way. It stayed on my phone for awhile after she passed until I brought myself to finally delete it one night because it was haunting me.

The whole time she was in hospice and a week and a half or so after she passed I lived in the house alone, except for when my aunt came down and stayed. My dad made it clear his home was my home and I was welcome any time, for however long, be it days or for good, and my aunt offered to stay as long as I needed her to, some of my mom's oldest friends offered me places to stay as well, but I felt like I needed to be alone. During that time I sort of half grieved I guess. Many nights I laid in bed thinking over and over about her dying, I dreamed about it. That first night alone in the house was the only time through the whole ordeal I let myself cry without holding it back.

It felt like I had already lost my mom in many ways. She wasn't dead, but she moved out to be on her death bed. Her simply being in a place like that, despite how wonderful it was and the privacy we were given, made our relationship change because we were never really alone again. A lot of the time she wasn't there mentally.

The day she passed the nurses had called me around 7-8 am and told me they were expecting it to be soon, in all likelihood that day, so I should come down as soon as possible if I wanted to see her. I didn't want to. I called my dad and my aunt and told them and talked to them. My dad didn't really believe it (after all the times she'd surprised us before, I can't blame him - I should say here they had grown extremely close again, she met him when she was 14 and they always loved each other very much despite not being always together) but my aunt basically talked me into going down there. She didn't say I should, she tried to leave it up to me, but after our talk I felt certain I needed to.

When I saw her she was awake, responsive, interactive, but she couldn't talk - for the first time completely unable to. We had to use signals, mainly for when she wanted water, because she could no longer handle drinking, I had to dip a mouth swab sponge thingy in some water and let her suck on it, but even that was too much for her. Sounded like every single breath was an absolute struggle. I stayed for a couple of hours or so, maybe less, before I just had to go. I didn't feel bad about this before because I knew she'd have understood and I decided I wouldn't beat myself up over it because she and I both knew just how much I loved her and if it was so much I had to leave, there's nothing I could've done about it I told myself; I had to care for myself as well, if it was too painful to handle I needed to not push myself too far. I obviously feel a little bad about it now, but I'm eternally grateful that fate ended up so that the nurse on shift for her that day happened to be one of her best friends, one of the most caring and comforting people I've ever met. She moved her nurses' station into my mom's room and sat right beside her bed the entire time until she passed. If it wasn't for that I truly don't know how I would have let myself live knowing I left her alone despite what I told myself.

A couple of hours later I had to get out of the house so I rode to the store on my bike, it was a pretty nice day out. I tried to be normal, I don't know how to explain it, but I knew she was going to die that day yet I'd spent countless days thinking that already. I happened to call the nurse to check in on her in the parking lot and she said she was doing about the same. On my ride home, maybe two minutes later, the phone rang and I answered it while I was still riding, it was the nurse telling me that she went back in right after getting off the phone from me to see that she had just passed. I knew what the call was going to be and I always got off my bike (biking is a hobby of mine) to answer a call, so I don't know what to make of me not stopping. You'd think you would stop doing whatever you're doing when you know you're about to hear your mom has passed away. I don't know, I guess I just find it interesting. Although probably I just really wanted to get home."
Applying for colleges,"I hate the typical small talk between adults now at my age. It always leads to ""So what colleges are you looking at?"". This always pisses me off because I really have no idea where I want to attend. Neither of my parents attended college so they don't have a clue about how all of this works out. My biggest fear that is giving me the most anxiety is not getting accepted to a good school. No offense, but I think that getting into a good school is what makes or breaks the rest of your life. I know that may be horrible to say but that fact keeps me up at night. I have good grades, averaging an A-, but I'm still scared about this whole application process. I feel like the first good college that responds back I am going to go to no matter what. I know this might just be a hopeless rant to you but college is really worrying me. I'm afraid of senior year, having all the kids brag about the colleges in other states that their rich moms and dads pay for. Any advice on the application process?

EDIT: Thanks for all the help with the feedback! I'm planning on going to a local university that my mom works at (so i'd get free tuition) and I'm trying to start with Finance) so that is looking like my number one choice right now. "

I think I did some significant damage to my body!,I’ve never taken proper care of my body and now I feel like I damaged myself. I haven’t been looking after my health or my dental problems. I’ve basically neglected myself and now I think my body is going to trash now! I feel like an idiot and I regret it
My mom tells me to “stop being negative” when I mention my struggles!,Whatever I mention to her that I’m struggling with she gets angry at me for feeling that way and she just expects me to just stop the feeling! Mind you I can’t find any reason why I feel that way. I can’t feel down or not be ok. I must be happy and ok with everything and be positive. It sucks when you have nobody around to listen but unhelpful people.
"I want to talk about my problems, but whenever I start to type I get mental blocked","I have no one to talk to and I want someone who I can let it all out to without bothering them but I can't seem to muster up any words.

I don't want to suffer in silence, anymore, but I'm also having a hard time finding the time to dwell on my problems. 

I feel pent up, like i'm going to explode or pass out. Trapped. If anyone has any advice on how to get the ol' complaining juices flowing I would appreciate it."
I want to move out so fucking bad,"I'm currently 23 and still living with my dad. Lately he has been driving me crazy and I would do anything to just get away from him. He babies me like crazy, calling me at work everyday to see what time im done so he can pick me up and give me a ride home(I don't have a car yet so I primarily take the Bus to work and home). He makes me dinner every night and its starting to irritate me. I have to help him with every technological problem there is no matter how simple the fix is. He is constantly barging into my room acting and talking in the most annoying way possible. He is an alcoholic and having to deal with him when he is drunk makes me want to gouge my eyes out. I'm currently working on finding a better paying job so that I can one day move out but until then I have to just suffer for as long as it takes for me to move out."
I can't cry,"I don't think I've actually cried in close to 2 decades. Now, after a particularly stressful day at work or a particularly biting insult from my wife, I can't help but feel that if I could cry that I'd feel some relief from something.

Everything is just a haze of emotional discomfort. I just want the numbness to go"
My coworkers all went out without me.,"I work for a small vet clinic (10 employees including the practice manager and owner, 5 other techs besides myself, and 3 doctors). Last night was the company Christmas party at a local restaurant, it was open bar and super fun. As it was wrapping up and we were all getting ready to go home, the owner asked the other techs if they were still planning on going out for drinks together after.  
  
The other techs are all within 2 years of my age (25) and I thought we were friends, as stupid as that sounds. We've worked together for 2 years and have gotten together outside of work in the past.  
  
They awkwardly said yes, they were going out, and hustled out of the restaurant without looking at me and one other girl. feelsbadman. She gave me a ride home and talked about how bullshit it was.  
  
I'm honestly really hurt. I don't know about you, but I have trouble making friends because all I ever do is work. I thought, at least my coworkers are cool. I just want to be included in their apparent clique because we see each other 40+ hours a week.  
  
I'm so fucking lonely."
"My father believes the black/muslim/jew people are out to get us (european) whites. He tells me to ""open my eyes"" and he hopes that my children won't ""end up wearing turbans."". I hate him.","

He frequently makes jokes in VERY bad taste (not to him, he finds them hilarious and laughs when I get upset and tell him to stop) about jews, muslims, blacks and gay people (although he doesn't think gays are taking over the world, he's just disgusted by it but he's okay if they do their thing in privacy). He claims he's not racist because

a. he doesn't mind them as long as they stay out of europe and

b. black people are the racists.

He spends hours reading some online websites and articles, which basically feed him this stuff (he was racists to start with and only got worse). He seriously believes that the ""white man"" will soon become slave of the ""coloured man"".

I can understand distrust of the ""strange"". If you grew up in a 99.9% white country, with no muslims and no gays (officially), it'll be hard for you to let go of some of that. And there are places where immigrants from outside of europe don't seem to integrate that well. But the level of hate and distrust he has towards anyone that's not white is really something else entirely. It's a combinations of paranoia and pessimism.

He believes that the cultural differences are too large to allow for proper integration of muslims and black people into a white, european society. I find the idea that all black people are part of the same culture insane, but that's what he believes and you won't sway him.

The annoying thing is, he's a very well read man. He knows (to some degree at least) 4 languages, he knows a lot about history of Europe and the rest of the world as well to be honest, he knows a lot about politics and a lot about philosophy. He's always learning something new, looking up random things to learn more. He's hard working, talented and friendly (unless you're part of those groups he hates obviously), but I really just dislike him. He's a bit of a dick to my mum as well but that's a whole other can of worms.

I can hardly spend time with him when I visit my parents. We all love watching movies but god forbid there's someone black, turban-wearing or ""jewy""-looking on screen. He immediately has to comment on that (he comments on many things throughout the movie as well which annoys the hell out of me). When the credits roll he likes to point out the Jewish names. It's all so absurd it's almost funny, but you really get sick of it after a while. I think Woody Allen is the only Jew he likes, but he thinks Jews are running the banks and businesses and hollywood so he hates them.

If there's someone on TV that's not white (he's fine with Japanese, Chinese etc (don't wanna say ""asians"" because I mean those certain countries, not India and middle east etc) although he tends to comment on their eyes) he'll immediately go ""oh look at that nigger. look at that nose"" or something. If it's a guy in a turban it's more like ""oh you motherfucker go back to your own country, don't you have some bombs to set"". He'll also comment on the gays or if someone's just a bit ""gay looking"", but as I said, he's not worried about them taking over the white man's world so it's not AS bad (but god forbid ""those abominations"" try to start families...)
It's such a hostile environment to be in. I see him once every month or so but I get sick of him immediately and dread spending time with him.

I honestly don't even know how to argue with him. I don't know what to say! Some of the stuff is so absurd I just have to laugh, but it scares me. He's my dad, and he's never been bad to me as such, and I feel like I should love him because he's my dad but he can be such a moron and I actually hate him and hate spending time with him. He's poisoning my mum (who is easily influenced, a bit naive) with his ranting as well and I love my mum and don't want her to become like him.

I hate my father. For these reasons and many, many more. And the fact that a lot of the time he makes those jokes just because he knows it annoys me and when I get up and leave because I don't wanna listen to him anymore, both my parents are just like ""oh come on, you're so easily offended"". I wanna tell him that he's wrong but I don't even know how to. I don't know how to and where to begin.

I don't know what I'm expecting here, but I had to get this off my chest.



**PS: I can't believe Racist_Dad was available!**"
I hate when there's a pause in the noise of the TV so I can hear my parents fighting,"It's all they do, it's all they've ever done."
"My brother is addicted to heroin, lost his job, texted me on Monday that he's homeless and I haven't heard from him since.","My brother got a severe back injury (five herniated discs) a couple of years ago while at work and for whatever reason it hasn't been healed/cured/fully treated yet. So he's in constant pain and the doctors won't give him pain medication. He also can't afford to go to a doctor on his own and only goes when the state or his old job or whatever is paying for it (I have no idea how the whole American medical/workman's comp/injury at work situation works).

Anyway, a couple of months ago I guess one of his buddies gave him some heroin and he's been smoking it for the pain. He only told me about it a few weeks ago and has several times expressed a desire to go to rehab and get off of it, and mentioned how much he hates it and hates being addicted. I told him to talk to one of my friends who was in rehab recently for the same thing and he refused, saying he doesn't want anyone to know. In fact, he swore me to secrecy when he told me about it.

I don't know what to do. Our parents don't have any money so they wouldn't be able to help him even if they did know. I have no idea who his current circle of friends is so I can't even contact any of them to ask if they've seen him. Our mom said she talked to him on Tuesday. 

Also, his girlfriend broke up with him last week and told him she had been seeing someone else the entire time (it was only a few months I think, but still), so I know he's been depressed about that. I really don't know how I can help him. I'm all the way on the other side of the country and I'm in the military, so I can't just drop everything and go home to look for him. I don't want to send him any money because he'll probably just use it to buy drugs, and I don't really have money to just be throwing away at him. I've already loaned him way too much money (that I'll probably never see back) over the past ten years.

And I just got an e-mail from my mom saying that he got a letter saying he was turned down for some sort of treatment for his back, so that's just another turd on top of the shit heap that is his life lately.

I'm mostly writing this to get it off my chest but any advice would definitely be appreciated."
My girlfriend is always depressed,"She has anxiety issues and takes medication for it. Every time I see her, she mopes and will not talk about what's on her mind. We quit drinking, because she can't without having a mental breakdown. The quarantine has only made things worse. A few weeks ago, she was depressed about not having her own place, for her and her kid. Now, she is depressed about living alone. I know she can't help it, but it's starting to takes it's toll on me. Not sure I can handle much more.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Just needed to get it off my chest."
Stimulus checks for everyone but college students... (and a few other groups of people... I know I'm not the only one)?,"I lost both my jobs due to current events. I am stressed beyond belief about paying rent. When I found out about the stimulus checks, I felt so relieved, but my mom just told me today that I am not getting one since I didn't claim as a dependent in 2018. I am stressed, depressed, and pissed. I know I am not the only one out there who is pissed about that stupid ""you're a college student, so your parents must pay for everything"" bullshit. Okay, rant over. Sorry if I'm a pussy."
"I just don’t know what to do anymore, my life seems to be the same dreadful, boring day, everyday.","I’m 19 now and I’m just depressed as hell, I’ve never had a gf, I have no job, no car, barely any money, a family who always puts me down, etc. I’ve been wanting change but all I’ve got goin for me is community college, which I’m barely getting through. My mom says I’m not shit because I don’t pay bills and only spend my time studying and not out “doing shit”. 

Every time I wake up the same saying goes through my head, “today will be like yesterday and today will be like tomorrow”. I have no one to talk to about this and thought I’d give this place a shot, I’ve wanted so much more but never been able to achieve more. I’ve wanted my own place, a car, a gf most of all, etc. But I just can’t, I can’t get a job with no car or money, can’t get a place with no job, and can’t get a gf without any, I feel like my life is just an empty void, no ups, just small inconveniences that keep adding up. 

I’m ngl I used to consider suicide back in HS but now I just feel nothing, I get small joy from movies and games but that’s it, nothing else. I know it could be a lot worse, i could not be eating, not have a house, etc. But the lack of any real joy in my life keeps biting at me and I just wanted to put it out there as I have no friends willing to hear this kind of stuff out.

TLDR; I’m depressed, my life has seen few joys and I just don’t know what I can do to improve it in the slightest."
Why should I be worth others time if I don't think I'm worth my own?,"I'm gonna give some context for this post.

For the past few years of my life, I've been in and out of therapy and nothing has worked. The medication I'm currently on seems to be doing at least something but it's come at the cost that when I have particularly bad depressive episodes I feel worse than I did prior to taking the medication.

Now onto the main part of the post.

I don't deem myself worthy of the time of those around me. Everybody has better people they could be spending time with. I'm not interesting - I talk about the same shit constantly. I come across as pretentious. I feel like I'm nothing but an irritation and a burden to those around me. I struggle to focus on one given thing meaning people get annoyed by my constant lack of attention span. I complain way too often about my feelings to those around me. I just hate myself so deeply at present. My only solace seems to come from sleep or from writing. Nothing else seems to help.

I'm not even worth my own time anymore."
My friend is copying me.,"Well I'm pretty young and I think that I have a lot of achievements for my age (14) I know how to write code in c#, I play piano, and I make animations in Maya / Blender / Cinema 4d but I have a friend that can't stop trying to do everything that I do. For some reason in the last year, he decided to do everything I do. He decided to start learning blender, write code in python, learn how to play piano, and I can't stand it. maybe I'm exaggerating but it's awful. it's like he doesn't want me to have my own personality. I don't want to talk to him about my life because every time I do he starts doing it again."
The worst part about having a serious personal issue is when you have nobody to talk to!,You can't say anything to anybody because of how they'll feel when you tell them. I can't even tell myself the truth of what's wrong with me because I don't want to face the problem. It's been a hard life for me!
Help me my friend is talking about committing suicide,She has already cut herself and told me she is writing a suicide note right now. I hope someone sees this. I threatened to call the authorities on her. She lives 20 minutes from me. I don't know what to do.
You're not sorry,"This probably should go in /r/offmychest but the environment here seems more supportive and I'm not in the mood for a beat down.  I'm about to go on a relationship rant and I know I have played a role in the dysfunction I live with. I just need to vent.  I don't have anyone else in my life I can say this to.  So, thanks Reddit, for giving me a wilderness to shout into.

Yesterday was my birthday.  Once again, you dropped the ball.  Not because you tried and fumbled.  But because you didn't even bother to get on the field.  A birthday is not something that catches you by surprise.  It's a firm date on the calendar, comes around predictably once a year.  So for you to say, ""sorry your birthday got messed up"" is a huge crock of crap.  Save your breath.  I'd rather you not say anything at all than throw me a bullshit, half-hearted apology.

You don't have the right to apologize.  You did nothing.  No gift, no card, no cake.  Ok, you made pancakes for breakfast and you wished me happy birthday.  I feel like a bitch because on the face of it, it looks like a nice gesture.  You made breakfast for me, how sweet.   But let's take a closer look shall we?  I don't like pancakes.  You know this.  We've been married almost 20 years.   Of all the breakfast foods you could pick, almost any one of which I like better, you go with pancakes.  What's more, you got up late to do it, and sprung it on me as I was getting in the shower.  I hadn't planned on eating a sit-down breakfast, I had just enough time to shower and pack my lunch before leaving for work.

But I felt compelled to rush through my shower so I could sit and eat the pancakes, that I didn't want, that made me late for work, because I felt shitty for not being grateful that you did something for me.  But I have to ask myself if maybe that wasn't the point, make me feel guilty and shitty.

I didn't go shopping Tuesday because I was damned if I was going to buy my own birthday present.  That's what happened last year with the boots *(I bought a pair of boots a couple of weeks before my birthday last year -- guess what got thrown into a gift bag and given back to me as my gift -- yep, the only gift.  Ha, ha, surprise!).*  

I wanted to see if you would make any effort, any whatsoever, to get something for me.  Didn't care what it was, just time and thought into getting me a gift.  Could have been a $20 gift card.  Price didn't matter.  Any token that showed effort.  Alas, it was not to be.  Not as if you didn't have the time, you took the day off.  Surely you could have found 5 minutes to run into a grocery store, drug store, gas station, and pick up a motherfucking gift card.

You wonder why I'm depressed.  Why I have no self esteem.  Because you treat me like I'm nothing.  It's not that you don't love me, I know you do.  But I need more.  I need you to see me, to be present with me, to engage.  I know you are not capable of that and the passive aggressive dance that we've perfected will continue until I eventually gain the strength to leave.  I told myself not to expect anything so I wouldn't be disappointed.  I'm not surprised this is how it went down, but I am disappointed.  I wanted to believe you would pull through in some small measure.  You've proven that I'm a fool.  So I've got that going for me, which is nice.

I digress.  My point was, please don't tell me you're sorry when you're not.  You did nothing to be sorry for.  Because you did nothing.  And I know you're not sorry you did nothing, or you would have done something.  Just leave me alone.  That should be easy enough.

Edited to add:  Thank you to anyone who read this wall of text.
TL;DR - SO did almost nothing to recognize my birthday and it made me feel like an invisible piece of crap.
"
My friend wants to kill himself... and his ex told him to just go ahead and do it.,"I have no idea what to do. I know I can't fix it. I know it's not my responsibility, but that doesn't stop me from feeling obligated. He's told me so many times that I'm literally his only friend. He's still in love with his ex, a woman who constantly berates and belittles him in front of their three year old daughter. 

His daughter is his whole life. He forgoes social interaction in favor of being available in the event that his ex MIGHT give her to him for a day or the weekend or an hour. 

He puts her ahead of everything else in his life and still doubts that he's a good father. 

I can't tell him what a wonderful father he his. I mean I CAN, and I DO, but he doesn't hear it. 

I can't tell him that he IS deserving of love.
I can't tell him that his ex is a goddamn CUNT for playing games and making his daughter think that he doesn't want her. 

His ex, ""Charity"", won't give him notice on when she's going to drop off the kid. She won't respond to texts about when he gets to see her. 

Charity will start fights with Ryan in front of the kid and tell him what a shitty person and terrible father he is.

I swear to GOD, if I were there to witness this, that woman would be immediately lacking half her face. 

I just want to hug him and tell him things will get better. I want him to know that this pain is temporary. I want him to understand that one day his baby girl will be old enough to understand what's going on and she will be old enough to understand how much he loves her. 

Until then, he's hurting. Until then, he has to deal with Charity. Until then, every day that he drops that angel off, he's uncertain of when he'll get to see her again and that makes him want to end it. 

A few days ago, during a fight, Ryan asked Charity what she wanted him to do. She looked him dead in the eye and said, ""Die.""

Die. 

She's pulling his heart out, one fiber at a time, using his daughter as a pawn. 

It is heart breaking to watch this happen. I can't do anything about it. I can't fix her, I can't fix him, I can't repair their relationship or even mediate a degree of civility between them. 

He posted this on his Facebook:
*Sundays...Sundays are rough. Sundays I have to tell my beautiful girl good bye, and I love her. I have to be strong, not cry, and act happy. I have to tell her that I'll see her soon, knowing that I may not be strong enough to make it until the next time. Sundays I have to see Charity. Bittersweet. She is so beautiful, and I love her so much, yet she wants absolutely nothing to do with me...Rightfully so, but it doesn't ease my pain. Sundays are so hard, because when they leave, my whole life leaves with them. Sundays hurt. My heart hurts, my eyes hurt from crying, and my soul hurts. As much as Sundays kill me, sometimes Monday mornings are worse. You see, Monday morning I go to a friend's house where I stay, open the bedroom door and see nothing but memories. It never fails, as soon as I open that door, the tears fall. Not just little tears, but soul emptying tears. Tears that are pure pain...they don't stop until I'm unconscious. My daughter isn't there for me to hold. Charity isn't there to call me fathead. Everyone says it will ease with time, but I assure you it doesn't. ..and won't. Seeing her happy is bittersweet, because i want her to be happy...But, I want to be the one she is happy with. My happiness is across town, in a 3 bedroom home we had built to raise our family in. I'll never be allowed back into happiness. See, this is how my life will continue. Every day will be a Sunday or a Monday, even if it is a Tuesday or a Wednesday. Sometimes I think about it, and it seems like the whole situation would be better without me in the equation. Better for everyone, not just me. But, yes, I am tired of the pain. Just as much pain as I'm in, I have caused, too. Well, guys, that is my rant...and look at the time...it is a Monday. I'm not going to make it to see many more of these days, this I promise*


I want to help him. I want to be there for him. I can't tell you how many times I've driven the 40 minutes it takes to get to his work just to hang out for an hour with him on his lunch break, because I KNOW that it's when he has time to just sit around and miss his baby. "
My girlfriend broke up with me for a chance at getting back together with her ex.,"She thought she had a chance at getting back together with her ex boyfriend (she didn't), and now cuts herself because she hurt my feelings and thinks she is a terrible person. I am being a good friend to her, and she says she is not and never has been suicidal, but I know that she is harming herself."
like a girl but hate the way she makes me feel.,"First let me say I'm 23/m and for most of my life I've been really unemotional, I remember all the emotions from back before I was about 10 or so, but since then for most of my time I've felt completely empty, I know how to act whenever I need to show emotions but I never really feel them except for the very rare day every few months where I wake up and I'm able to feel emotions all day, then when I go back to sleep I don't feel them the next 2-6 months.  I'm fine with this and accepted this is just how I am and will probably always be.

But I just started college again a few weeks ago and I met this really awesome girl in my class, beautiful, smart, awesome personality, the whole deal really, I can't help but smile when I'm around her, and my heart races just thinking about her, but all this is bringing out feelings I haven't had in years and I'm really hating it. I know she is out of my league and probably deserves better, but I really want to ask her out but I don't want to feel these feelings anymore, i can't handle them. 

Basically I really don't know what to do, or even how I would ask her out."
I can't stop thinking about death.,"Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this. I am a 32-year-old woman, and I want to preface this post with the following: I am happy/I love life. I have an amazing boyfriend of 3 years, an adorable dog, my own profitable business and an apartment I rent in NYC. I am a published writer, have hobbies and have a wonderful relationship with my family. I'm relatively healthy, have great friends and have the joy of working with children every day. I had a privileged childhood with no trauma and no loss other than the passing of my grandparents.

With all that said, I have been completely plagued with thoughts of death for the last year. Out of nowhere last September (not even near my birthday), I seem to have developed a preoccupation overnight with thinking about my own mortality. I don't worry that it will happen soon--I just have this voice in my head that reminds me all throughout the day that I am going to die one day (for some people I know this is a comforting thought, but for me it incites panic). Nobody around me would know that these thoughts are flowing through my mind a minimum of probably 20 times a day, because I'm focused and seem very in-the-moment (though obviously I'm not 100% so!). 

If I had to self-diagnose, I would say the following things are coming into play: a predisposition for anxiety, mild OCD-like tendencies, a need to be in control, an overactive mind and then what I would consider to be a natural curiosity about things of an existential nature. 

I should also state that I do not subscribe to any particular religious dogma (I was raised Jewish) and am doubtful about an afterlife (and don't particularly want to be convinced of one at this juncture).

I just don't know how to make the thoughts go away. I feel like I'm turning my life into this task of waiting for something to end (I don't know if that makes sense). I haven't lost my ability to enjoy it, but I would definitely say that every joy seems to be laced with this heaviness--this reminder that this is all fleeting. I completely understand on a practical level that this awareness should just allow me to treat everything as a gift and to savor it, but in practice that isn't how my mind is processing it. Additionally, I don't buy into the theory that when you're old you're always ready, because my own mother feels nowhere near ready to go, and the thought of that for myself terrifies me. 

It's probably also worthwhile to note that while I said this erupted in September, there was a period when I was somewhere between 7 and 9 where I sort of ""realized"" that I was going to die one day. Don't ask me why, but I have suddenly recalled a memory that the original Superman movie (which I only saw that one time on TV) sort of ignited it (I have this memory of Superman as a baby floating through space, though I may have made that scene up). Somehow the idea of space and death have always been interrelated to me because of the infinite nature of time and space. I remember from that point forward regularly getting into a panic as a child at night when I would let myself think about the inevitability of death. Thank heavens I had a TV in my room and could drown out the thoughts. It then just went away and I stopped thinking about it. 

I recently confided in this to my mom only to discover that she used to have insomnia as a child thinking about death and that her mom would turn on the radio for her to drown out her thoughts. 

I have tried talking to a therapist, but that hasn't really helped. I'm thinking about meditation and Eastern sort of philosophies in general (not religious ones per se, but more of just life perspectives), and I'm seriously considering hynotherapy. I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to think about death every day for the rest of my life.

Does anyone have any insight? "
the state of the world,"These past few months, I've felt myself becoming angrier and sadder every day by the state of the world. There's always a new police shooting. There's always another attack on women's rights. There are people out there who hates me and wants me dead soley for the reason that I am a lesbian. There are so many fights to be fought, and all of them seem to be lost. I don't even live in Hong Kong, or the US, or anywhere else that's currently having people fight for their rights. I am very lucky, but still I feel exhausted, and I can only imagine what it's like to live in the middle of it all.

It's just really draining. I've always wanted to believe that a majority of people *are* good, or at least they want to be. But every day I see news stories of women who were killed for turning down a romantic advance, or read about power-hungry individuals ristricting human rights, or people being shot for daring to be black. I feel so much empathy and pain and anger and fear and it's just exhausting. 

I know I'm privileged. I live somewhere safe, where the law protects me and we rank top in equality. My real life is only impacted by the ocassional sexual harassment and casually homophobic comments, and the things I witness online I can always turn off (which I have, my phone is locked away in a safe until Saturday. I deleted my private Instagram. Besides Reddit for these past 30 minutes, I haven't been on social media). 

However, I feel I owe it to the world to not turn a blind eye. But I damn it, I am so tired. I have been active online my entire life, and I consider myself to be politically active and extremely aware of a lot of the injustices in the world. And I do genuinely care, as superficial as that may sound. My heart hurts and I have this anger that runs deeper than anything I've ever experienced, both on behalf of myself and others. 

I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm probably not the only one feeling defeated lately. I hope I feel a bit better soon, because I don't want to sit idly by for long. Still, I need a break after years of this constant stream of negativity and bad news.

Thanks for listening."
"Working for the first time in 4 months, and I'm miserable."," So I got let go from my last job earlier this year. I did not see it coming at all, and was completely blind sided by it on a Friday. I had been there for 2 and a half years, and the previous month had received a glowing review. I started looking for work immediately, but due to everything going on that took a while, and I finally started a new job 3 days ago on Monday. I fucking hate being back at work. I have spent the last 9 and a half years working full time, 40+ hours a week, while only receiving 2 weeks of vacation time a year, half of which were used on sick days because I have never gotten any paid sick days. The last 4 months of being unemployed were amazing. I've been on unemployment, which is a little bit over half of what I was making previously, and with reduced spending I've had no issues staying afloat. I've been able to just exist, unburdened by the 9 to 5 grind, and I am now terrified that I'm going to spend the next 35-40 years working 5-6 days a week, just like I've been doing for the last 10, and this small taste of freedom over the past few months has solidified what I already knew. The vast majority of my days are spent somewhere I don't wanna be, doing something I don't want to be doing, for someone who usually doesn't deserve all the wealth that they have. This is no way to live, and yet I feel trapped by it. I feel so tired, and I haven't even finished my first week yet. I just don't know what to do anymore, but I do know that I don't want the rest of my life to be this. I feel like I forgot how miserable this made me while I was unemployed. Had a panic attack over it on Monday after work, and now I'm on some anxiety meds to help cope. I can't quit either because then I lose my unemployment benefits. God I wish I had declined this job offer and remained unemployed for as long as possible. I was so much happier."
Entitled aunt could have potentially given my grandfather COVID-19,"I’m making a second post about the same person. The link to the first post is right below.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/dl5j07/i\_just\_learned\_the\_horrible\_truth/](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/dl5j07/i_just_learned_the_horrible_truth/)

Last Monday, I woke up and had a pretty bad mood already, from the fact I had to do homeschool that day and I had quite the headache. My grandparents live across the street. I go look out the window to see my aunt’s massive Toyota van there. I was rather disgruntled, because my aunt is incredibly entitled. She hasn’t been following any of the measures meant to slow the spread of coronavirus. She hasn’t been wearing a mask in public, and she didn’t self-quarantine for the mandatory 14 days, and she both came from and showed in up hot spot states (Massachusetts and New York, respectively). Her local Walmart had 41 employees test positive for COVID-19, and she definitely didn’t wear a mask. This would’ve been just a coincidence, albeit a rather bad one, if not for the events I’m about to mention. My grandparents both came home from the hospital last weekend (grandfather for a urinary tract infection, and grandmother for rather extreme constipation). On Friday morning, an ambulance showed up over there. My mom went over there and found out why the ambulance was over there and also my entitled aunt mentioned that she had noticed a cough. As of right now, we aren’t sure if he has COVID, because he often coughs while eating and other times to clear his throat. And did I mention that he is a VERY high risk person, as he is going to be 87 in June, and relies on others for his most basic needs.  
Tl;dr: Entitled aunt may have given my grandfather coronavirus."
"I'm feeling torn between leaving one of the two friends I have in my class and to keep being his friend, even though the shit he starts is extremely petty.","So, my friends and I decided to play some minecraft together, and the owner of the server (who I will be referring to as M) is one of the two friends I have in my class, and he has a tendency to abuse power if he gets the chance. He doesn't listen to other people's opinions and just does what fits best for him most of the time. Otherwise, he is a pretty good friend.




My other friend (who ill be referring to as A) is a much better friend. He is really nice and considerate and I'd say that he is one of my closest friends.




So they were playing on the server when A suddenly found a wolf, but he couldn't tame it. M said that he would tame it, but A didn't want that, so A said that if M would teleport to him and ""steal"" it, A would kill the wolf.




M got really frustrated and went off on him on discord, so A blocked him, M then proceeded to message him on origin and pointed out everything he didn't like about A's personality. M said that A was a ""coward and a little shit"" and that he had a too short Fuze, that he made too much physical contact, wouldn't stop doing something when you told him to, and that he was just annoying. I think that M went way overboard and that he should had confronted him face to face and in private. 



A quoted what M said in the group chat for the server and then reminded M that they both have to go to school tomorrow, M saw this as a threat or a challenge to fight. 




And since I only have two friends in my class (and we only have eachother as friends in our class) , and the other friend is friends with both of M and I, and I'm afraid that if I confront M about the situation that he will get pissed and distance himself from me, and since we only have one common friend in the class, that friend will have to choose who he wants to be friends with, which would leave one of us completely alone. 

So I am extremely torn between siding with A and either loose all my friends in the class or leave someone completely alone with no one to talk to, or siding with M and leaving all of my other friends in the other classes. 


I feel sick to my stomach when I try to think of what I could do, because I only see two outcomes from this situation. If you have any advice, please comment or PM me."
I have a 4 month dry erase calendar that’s completely wrong,I keep trying to map out things. Over the last month my career has kept shifting. My calendar plans out my lsat study schedule for taking on the March lsat. I don’t want to erase it yet because I want to go to raise my score and go back to law school but I know it makes no sense for me financially right now. Also the deadline for registration is in 2 days. I'm not registering. It bothers me because the calendar is inaccurate. It’s the first thing I see when I wake up and it’s a reminder that i am a failure. It also has an exercise routine that I have ignored lately. I hate myself
My ex(30) that I(25) dated for 5 years but broke up with 3 years ago texted me out of the blue and dodged my questions about his current gf all day,"I’m just really annoyed. He’s asking me where I work, where I live, who I talk to. He wanted to know if I was still dating my roommate and was fishing for compliments. He was still trying to keep asking more about me but I just stopped responding. I am so fucking annoyed that he texted. He moved very far away and we have no reason to talk. None. I originally had him blocked but he texted and I didn’t respond and then he contacted my family asking where I was as if we were together. I don’t like that. If I don’t respond it’s because I don’t want to talk to you! Can’t you respect that? I said in an earlier post that I missed him. I really don’t. I loved him but I do not miss dating. He still talks like he’s in 7th grade (he has a masters) and doesn’t understand how to meet a woman’s needs at all. I was reminded of these things today. I would be pissed at my boyfriend if he talked to his ex while being with me like he talked to me today. I feel bad for his current gf. I want him to just leave me alone and stop trying to talk to me."
I don't want to go to work tonight. I feel like I can't say no and do whatever I want.,"I just don't want to go. But I feel like I can't tell them ""no"" I don't want to come in. I feel like my life belongs to that job and I can't do whatever I want anymore. I hate my work life. I wish I found a stable career by now that fits me but it's just too hard."
I don’t know what to do,"Edit: I just wanted to express thanks for the encouraging words I was given in the comments of this post, they’ve meant a lot to me these past few days, thank you kind people 

I just moved back to my apartment from visiting home because my first day of my senior year of college starts in the morning. I was reluctant to leave because I kept having this funny feeling about going back. 

Since I got here several hours ago I keep crying because I’m so homesick and sad and I just want to go home more than anything. I miss my parents and my boyfriend so much and it really hurts. 

I’m scheduled for 35 hours at work this week which is going to put me behind on school work already on the first week of class. On top of that I don’t think I’m going to be able to keep up with my hectic schedule this semester. 

Feeling so sad and overwhelmed before school even starts gives me a bad feeling. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety problems before and I’m afraid this is the start of falling back into it which worries me. 

Despite how I feel it doesn’t seem like I can do anything about it since the semester is already paid for and my lease would still need be paid regardless of whether or not I moved home. I’m not even sure I’d be much happier moving home since living with my parents has its challenges. 

I guess the point of writing this was to get off my chest how unhappy I feel and to just acknowledge the fact that I have no clue what to do. 

Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this whole thing. I hope I’ve been able to articulate myself well, but I fear my emotions have clouded my ability to communicate effectively. Anyway, thank you for reading my vent post."
I’m desperately trying to stay sober and I’m failing.,"I’ve been struggling with substance abuse for the past 13 years. I quit opioids 7 years ago and haven’t touched them since. But it’s alcohol that has a hold on me. When I drink, I drink until I’m blackout drunk. I wake up with the shakes. I’ve gone to rehab but I’ve gone downhill since then. I’m subscribed to quit drinking subreddits on here but I never really post. I’ve been hospitalized 3 times this year because of alcohol. All because my throat is starting to bleed when I drink. I’m only 31 and I know I won’t make it to 40 if I don’t quit. I don’t know I just needed to say this out loud."
Sooo... I just got dumped by my first boyfriend.,"That sucks. Like really sucks. I just started spiraling back into depression and I certainly didn't need that. But apparently he still ""has feelings for his ex-girlfriend"". I feel fucking awful guys. I hate that feeling. "
My fiancee is a freaking idiot,"She made some horrible choices last night and I'm so pissed off at her that I can't even stand it.  I'm half tempted to just start sleeping on the couch till I'm not pissed off anymore.  I could have lost her last night, and I don't know if she truly understands the gravity of the situation.  She's a fucking asshole sometimes, but god I fucking love her."
I'm boring,"I'm really boring, I'm not ambitious, I'm not passionate about anything and I don't have many interests. I'm not a fun person to be around, talk to or text to. 

I can never think of something to say even if I'm with someone who I'm really comfortable with, even if I do think of something it's never going to be anything interesting. I don't understand why anyone would want to be around me and I don't know how to change myself."
Grandma update,"I posted a couple weeks ago that my grandma had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer on May 2nd. 

She died May 25th at 8:42 pm at a hospice care center. It still doesn't seem real. I guess that's normal though. 

I miss you so much, Grandma. I'll love you forever and think of you always. Thank you for giving me a home to grow up in. Rest in peace."
Loving you has made me hate myself.,"You brokeup with me once and I wish it ended there. You knew my darkness but only decided you wanted to be with me when you saw I was moving on. You told me you were insecure and afraid you'd be disappointing. I assured you and tried so hard to rebuild what we were.

I have never misrepresented myself and I haven't changed. Maybe you decided to settle for less because perfect hadn't come along. You could be satisfied with a half hearted love because it's better than being alone.

I know my flaws. I'm short and chubby. I have stretch marks. My hair is starting to grey. I don't look like Kelly Brook or Anna Songs but before I though I still had value. I thought it was possible to be pretty without being perfect.

You haven't given me a compliment in years. You never touch me, even in the rare cases when we're having sex. But you're more satisfied with porn then having sex with me anyway. 

I feel like your maid and your chef but not like a woman you're proud to be with. When we're in public you often walk away from me leaving me running to catch up. You say you can't walk slow, I just feel you don't want to be seen with me.

I have forgotten how to see myself. I'm always looking through a warped funhouse mirror that only shows my flaws. For the past six months I've just wanted to peel my skin off and pour acid on myself until I melt into nothingness. 

I hate me for ever loving you.

I can't join the Navy.,"This is a bit of a complicated story, so bear with me.  I'm currently a graduate student in nuclear engineering, but as a kid all I wanted to do with my life was attend the Naval Academy and be a fighter pilot in the Navy.  Unfortunately, between the ages of 16 and 18 I discovered three things. Firstly, I don't like flying airplanes.  I don't mine riding in them, just actually piloting them was not the elaborate transcendental life-altering experience I was expecting.  Second, I struggled to meet the academies (very easy-to-meet) physical expectations for entry.  Third, I had childhood asthma, which was another obstacle.  All of these things together led me to decide to pursue a career in physics instead of the Navy.

My desire to join, though, never really went away, it just became dormant.  A few years ago, though, things changed.  First, a conversation with my doctor led me to believe that my asthma was actually misdiagnosed allergies (spoiler warning: this turns out to not be the case).  Second, I started working out, and got in the best shape of my life.  Finally, an offhand comment from my mother made me realize that the Navy would still love to have me, and that there was nothing stopping me from joining if I really wanted to.

So I applied to OCS, and got really excited about the prospect of joining the fleet.  Unfortunately, the asthma was still lurking in my medical records, and ended up medically disqualifying me, which I just found out about today.  I know that's how life goes; sometimes your dreams are beyond your reach no matter how hard you work for them.  It's just really disappointing that I can't serve.  Thanks for listening!"
My dad is heartbroken because I accepted a job 100 miles away.,"**EDIT: The title should say 1000 miles away. Sorry about that..**

I am a 24 year old woman and I have been looking for a full time job in the creative field since i graduated from college last year. I also have been wanting to move somewhere new and see and experience more of the world. I've lived in Tennessee my whole life and I've never experienced living somewhere completely new and different. Just to the next town over for school. My boyfriend moved a thousand miles away for grad school, and we don't want to do long distance anymore. I got an offer at a company I really like where he is that is perfect for me. I accepted it today, and I have to be there on Monday. So it's pretty quick.

I told my dad about the job offer today and that I would be going, and he's really upset about it. My father is very traditional in that he grew up in a rural area where most people don't move more than a few miles from home after they get married and start a family. I've been taught my whole life that family and the farm we grew up is pretty much the most important thing on earth. Family sticks together and stays together.

He went to the same college 50 miles from where he grew up (and where I grew up). After he graduated, instead of moving to where he could have gotten an engineering career started, he moved home and helped his parents run the family business. And he got married, had a family and never left. He claims he has no regrets he chose to move home to take care of his parents. He felt it was his duty and privilege to do so and be there every day. (They both passed away over ten years ago.)

We are very alike in many ways, and he expected I would do exactly what he did with his life. But I've gotten an urge to go somewhere new and see the world. I am almost 25 and I want more out of life than the family business and family farm. I went to the same college he did and graduated and had to move home a few months after due to being unable to find a job in my field. Now he wants me to carry on the business and use my skills in the business to make pretty good money, or start my own business. But that's not really what I want to do. Not right now, anyway. And I have no friends here. Just my dad and cousins and younger brother. (And the place he lives is 20-25 minutes by car to town. It's very isolated, but a beautiful place to call home.)

My mother and I are estranged, and she hasn't really been in the picture for half of my life. When she left us, he made a lot of sacrifices to take care of us as a single father. His whole life is focused around me and my brother. And he sees me as ungrateful for all he's done for me. He always tells us that the farm is ours when he is gone, and he's saved all of it for us, his children. But it feels like the price of his gift of raising me is living up to his expectations and the life as he's planned out for me.

I told him about the job, and he got really quiet and acted like I'd broken his heart and betrayed him. He knew that I was looking to move there, but I think he didn't expect it to happen. I am going against everything he raised me to be, and he believes I don't care about family like he does.

He also isn't ok with me moving to the city my boyfriend is living in, and staying with him. Our relationship is pretty serious, but we aren't engaged or anything. I think this is the right thing for my life, though, and I just wish he could be emotionally supportive. It's already a scary transition, having to make new friends and start over somewhere new. His negativity and complete disapproval of my choices makes it seem 10 times harder. I feel like I owe my dad so much for the good live he's given me, and I feel awful for hurting him.

**tl;dr** I am not living up to my dad's expectations of living on the family farm and working in his small town family business. I accepted a job offer in the city where my boyfriend is in grad school and he's very upset with me and I feel awful."
My acne is ruining my life,"I've struggled with my acne for about 3 years now, It's been off and on since then. I've been to several dermatologist and on every kind of antibiotics, some work and it clears up for a bit but it always comes back as soon as I finish the prescription. But it's not really my appearance that bothers me because I don't care much about how I look. It's how it makes me feel, I don't ever want to go out and have to see people. I don't feel confident at all, I shy away from people unless they're an old friend. I feel anxious and frustrated all the time and at the same time I always feel like I am about to throw up. Now I have no idea how acne and nausea correlate, but I hate it. I can't stand it. It's not so much what is causing it that matters it's just how I feel about it, it bothers me on every level."
"In lieu of 400 subscribers, I'd just like to say a few words","I find it hard to believe what this has become, but I mean that in a good way.

But when we look at this for what it really is, can you blame me for beening a little incredulous? One day, I sat down on my computer and tossed a question out into the void, leaving anybody to answer it however they chose. ""What is your current reason for being unhappy?"" It's a simple enough question. I didn't even expect many people to answer. But when people did answer, I found myself wanting to have a discussion with them. I wanted to share their grievences and problems with them. I wanted to tell people that they weren't alone and that at least one person, somewhere out there in the universe, can relate to their problem and understands. That at least one person genuinely cares. Sometimes it's easy to feel lost and alone in our worries. I find irony that people can connect so deeply and on an emotional level with someone over a medium that is known mostly for its anonymity. I'm a little awe-stricken by the internet's ability to connect people when they can feel so alone about their problems in day-to-day life. That's an extremely powerful thing to do.

Frequently we find that the internet can be a dark and scary place. People stop recognizing that a username is just a representation of an actual person. It's easy to attack a profile over the internet because they're barely seen as a person. Sometimes just words, sometimes a disembodied voice, and sometimes a picture, but rarely a person. But that doesn't mean those words can't actually have a real effect on someone. It's easy to shoot a bullet at a cardboard cutout of a person, if you forget that there's an actual person standing behind it, but that doesn't mean the person is going to be protected from your shot. I don't like that.

And that leads to what that simple question on /r/AskReddit did. The point wasn't to share thoughts, or opinions, it was to share experience. True, emotional experience that other people could relate to. It served as a reminder that there are real people on the internet, that share your feelings, and have been through some of the same stuff that you have. Everyone becomes more than just a username. They become someone that you can relate to. Someone that you can understand, and empathize with.

I suppose that's why we're all here. Because we need to find someone else that understands our problems, or because we want to let someone else know that we care. Both of those are a pretty remarkable thing. To put yourself out there to the world, and to be there for those people who put their trust in what you have to say.

The internet as a whole could certainly be improved by the example that all of you set here, and I'm very proud to be a part of it.

Thanks for reading,

Big changes in my life have left me feeling so utterly lost.,"*I don't really know what I'm writing this for. I think it's mainly to get it off my chest and try and get my brain to order all this craziness and start working through it all, but I don't even know. I can't approach anyone friend or family with any of this because, well mainly I don't really have any friends that I can approach with this sort of thing and me and my family are no where near close enough for it.

So, when I was a teen, about 14/15 (15 years ago now) I thought I was gay. It wasnt just a passing ""phase"" or whatever, I genuinely thought I was. Women did nothing for me, I'd tried, like most teens my age. But it just did not work out. Then I met a guy, he was a few years older than me, maybe 18/19 when we first met. I absolutely adored him, he was everything I wanted to be and more. He was openly gay, so caring, open, gorgeous and he wanted me to talk to him.

It took til I was about 16 to finally open up to himand say I thought I was gay. I remember that day like it was yesterday as he looked me straight in the eye and said, kiss me then if you want to. It took me by surprise but by god the way just that simple statement made me feel, was unreal. I knew then that I wanted him, and I was definitely gay.

Now we were together maybe 3 years, then he utterly broke my heart. Not deliberately, or intentionally, but he did. He'd asked me to move him with him, and look at starting a life properly together. I'd gone over to speak to him about it and try and work out where we were going to go wit this, and his best mate was there. I overheard their entire conversation, and she slated me so badly, like I was shit on the bottom of her shoe, she told him he was making a mistake etc etc. He never once defended me, or tried to convince her I wasn't a bad guy or a mistake.

I went home after that, utterly heart broke, not understanding what had happened. He called me and I straight up asked him about it, asked him if he thought the same as he'd not defended me, and he said he wasn't sure. He didn't know if we had a future etc.

Now, years later I completely understand the hesitancy, at the time I didn't realise how big a commitment it was and took it the wrong way. Anyway, we moved past that and I was part living with him and part living at home. Then I found out a year later he'd been sleeping with another man for 4 months. I was absolutely heart broken, I'd been making plans for our future, I'd finally been able to tell my friends and family that I was gay, and that I was on love with a man.

Then boom, everything shattered. I tried to get over it, but I just couldn't. I swore after that that I didn't want anyone else ever again.

Then a year or so later I met my now Ex wife. When we first met it was purely friendship, but then I fell in love with her. I wasn't physically attracted to her, I didn't want her in that way, but I loved that woman so much. We ended up getting into a relationship, ended up getting married, we even had 2 kids.

I've spent the last few years struggling really badly with my identity, I've suffered serious depression and anxiety episodes. I've lost weight, then gained more than I lost. I've gone back to smoking, I then quit. I ended up addicted to codeine as I couldn't talk to anyone about what was going on in my head and I needed an escape.

2 months ago my now ex wife finally decided she didn't want to be with me anymore, and she took our kids and left. The first few weeks after she left, I was on a massive downward spiral. I was suicidal, I was abusing codeine tablets by an insane amount. I took up smoking again, and that's got to the point where I'm on 40 a day again.

A couple weeks ago I decided that maybe this is time for a fresh start for me, and maybe I should stop pretending I'm not gay, that I'm not who I know I am. When I made that decision it honestly felt like a massive weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I spoke to my elder sister and she was happy for me and is trying to support me as best she can, but I'm in a massive hole now because I darent admit to anyone else that I'm gay.

I feel like I'm a dissapointment already and I don't want the few people I have left in my life to think any less of me or leave me because of this. But at the same time I feel the need to shout it from the roof tops and no longer hide it.

I don't know what to do, I want to be happy, I want to be me, I want to be able to live life again instead of watching it pass me by, but I just don't know how to overcome all the pain and negativity that's in my own head and heart never mind from anywhere else.

Sorry I just needed to get this out.*

***TL;DR***

***I'm gay, but hid that fact from my now ex wife, and spent a decade denying who I was. She's now left and I do not know how to be myself, the open, caring gay man that I know I am as I've had it locked away for so long and I feel like I'm doing something wrong by wanting to come out.***"
my life,"I've always been big and unattractive my whole 16 years. I've tried to lose weight multiple times and even now I'm trying, but I'm stuck after losing 20 pounds. When I thought I had a chance to date someone once we met up she stopped talking to me. I suck at every game even though I spend most of my time playing games. Even the game I have over 400 hours in I am bad. All my friends got valorant beta key except me so I'm left out. I'm trying to learn a language, but can't remember anything. I tried to graduate highschool a year early, but corona has me out of school and I can't get my work done. I honestly would kill my self if I had the will power."
Hearing voices/social anxiety,"I'm 17 I smoked a lot of weed while going through some traumatic events. I was unhappy before that and since those events I've been hearing voices. It's always the people around me. I'll hear my mother or my sister or people I walk by down the street. It's almost never logical and I try to tell myself that but it keeps happening. I dont know if it's schizophrenia or not. 
Sometimes I think I'm just misidentifying real noises for people and other times it's clear words. When I was still smoking, it was amplified and I thought if I stopped then the voices would stop but they haven't. I havent smoked for 2 weeks and it still happens. I wonder if its schizophrenia or just extreme paranoia I can't tell. It's not happening currently. It happens during or after social confrontations. I've had to turn and look to make sure people's mouths aren't moving because I'm hearing them. I've created insane stories in my head. White noise only worsens it. I also hear ringing in my ears, it doesn't bother me usually. Lately white noise has made the voices it really bad actually. I wish I could run away and live on my own then there would be no reason to hear anybody or get paranoid. But I know that wouldn't help in the long run. I need to get around people more but this problem makes me want to run instead. I wish I had a reset button for my brain."
I thought I was moving past my sexual/romantic frustration but now it’s coming back.,"20M

Yeah I thought I was moving past spending hours thinking and crying about how I’ve never been in a relationship or done anything sexual. And now it’s coming back hard. Even writing that out...it felt like a bad memory. 

I keep thinking of lost youth and missing out on young love. It bothers me so much, I can only think of suicide stopping it. I can’t fucking believe the average age to start having sex is 16/17 and I haven’t even been in a fucking relationship. How does everyone do that? How can they manage to participate in being a sexual being, and I can’t? Everything I do feels worthless because I haven’t reached that milestone. I don’t even know if it’s possible. I’m constantly fantasizing about it. r/wholesomememes is so damn depressing. All of those cute memes are made by teens in relationships and I can’t fucking stand it. I’m a bitter loser. I missed the age where everyone learns about it with each other and now I’m fucked. Fuck I’m gonna fucking off myself tonight this is fucking unbearable."
I want to cut loose with a friend,"We started hanging about 8 years ago in school and have remained in the same friend group since then. Little does he he know that for the past several years that I have wanted to cut loose. He's extremely passive aggressive towards us and mostly talks about himself and his childish problems. Anytime we would (non-aggressively) defend ourselves he would tell us to chill and basically tell us that we are too sensitive. 

He's also extremely hypocritical; everything he complains about other people, he does exactly. The story we hear is always the same about how everyone around him is wrong and that he's perfect. I know he comes from a pretty strict background and although I know he doesn't have bad intentions, I can barely stand his presence anymore. I wish him all the best in the future and I don't hate him, but I just can't be friends with someone like him.

I managed to talk to one mutual who feels the same way, but I am afraid to bring it up with the rest because the last thing I want to do is create any further tension. I know for a fact that if I personally bring it up with my problematic friend that he will get defensive, turn everything on me, and somehow say that I'm in the wrong (although he constantly has falling outs with other people and says that he hates when people are not direct). I need some advice on how I should proceed"
My birthday.,"I know this is a selfish post since there are lots and lots of people that face way more severe consequences due to the virus, but I just had to write this sonewhere.       

In the last couple of years I've lost a lot of friends because I moved away and they slowly startes never texting/calling/whatever again. I wasn't ever able to really make new friends because I'm anxious and I have a lot of special interest hobbies. The loss of nearly all of my friendships hurt me for the past couple of years.       

Every year when my birthday came, I felt outright depressed for 2 weeks. I knew it would only be me and my girlfriend and maybe my parents and/or hers for a visit. As someone who always had fun birthday parties with some good friends I felt lonely every year. Especially since my birthday is something I'm excited about which not all people can relate to.          

This year, I was finally somewhat over it. I knew I wouldn't hear from many people and there were actually more than I thought. My colleagues which I like very much were especially good for me. You can't call them 'friends' but at least they were thinking of me. We would also always do some small party when we had our teem meeting.        

Now, Covid-19 hit and we basically have quarantine in Germany. Not really, but pretty much. So we moved our  team meeting to online and I can't see anyone, not even my parents or well, my colleagues. My birthday was yesterday and I've seen no one and will see no one except my girlfriend until... I don't know.        

Now the sadness has kicked in again and I'm sitting on my kitchen, crying because again, I feel so lonely. Just due to this fucking virus."
I’m lonely,"So... I’m 20 and I’m so fucking lonely. I don’t have a boyfriend and never have had one.
i only hooked up with a few guys at random parties when I was way too drunk to even remember it.
I’ve always told myself that I needed to get my life together before I commit to someone else but now that I did it, I think something’s wrong with me ???? I don’t know I feel like crying just thinking about it.
Sometimes I think I’m afraid to fall in love if that even makes sense or that someone would never like me for who I am and then I think I’m the problem. It’s not beauty related because I do think I’m pretty and all but..
Don’t know what to do other than feel like shit all the time"
"I went on a bender that ruined my mental health, my relationship, and maybe my job.","I’ve been dealing with depression and panic attacks for years. I take meds to help with the panic attacks, and so far they’ve worked pretty well up until this point. Though they really don’t do a whole lot for depression, and that aspect has been getting worse and worse.

I took off work last Friday to go to a friend’s bachelor party. Now this friend is a mild mannered Christian guy, so very different from me, but I love him all the same. I guess I kinda lost it Thursday night and just started drinking. Heavily. And then Friday rolled around and I said “Screw it, it’s a bachelor party”. So I woke up and continued drinking. This kept going till Sunday. By Sunday I was more hungover than I’ve ever been, and more depressed and anxious than I’ve been in a long time. I also had to deal with the fact that I acted like a complete drunken fool the whole weekend to my Christian friend and his other Christian buddies. They basically said they couldn’t hang out with me anymore..

Monday rolls around, I’m feeling almost worse. I take off work. I spend the whole day doubled over, body locked up, shaking and weak. “Must be the hangover” I thought.

Tuesday, I feel like shit still but go into work. Everyone tells me I look like death, that I should go home. I try to stick it out and almost pass out so I leave. I’m still shaking and losing consciousness. I go to the doctor, nothings wrong.

This continues until today. I realized last night that these are panic attack symptoms that I haven’t had in a long long time. I’ve basically drank myself into having panic attacks again. I took off work again, making it 2 days and 2 half days. People at work are wondering what’s wrong, and I feel like I might lose my job. And the worst part is last time I dealt with these issues of panic attacks it took almost a year to get over them before I could function enough to have a steady job. I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t get a grip in the next few days. 

I’ve never posted on reddit before, but I figured this was a good start. I’m at rock bottom right now. I don’t really know where else to turn."
I'm in love with my bestfriend,I've known her for six year but only recently realised how much I love her. I think I'd rather not tell her than risk ruining our friendship. I can't imagine what my life would be like without her. It's 5 am and I can't stop thinking about this whole situation and about her but I honestly don't know what to do. I hope I don't regret my decision either way.
Teenage siblings don't want to hang-out with me anymore :(,"There's a 12 year gap between us, and due to rough circumstances at home, I pretty much had to raise them myself. Now, they're 13 and 15 years old, and the more they grow, the less they need me. Though it's a part of life, I'm having such a hard time with this! Before, we used to do everything together; We would go on outings, hike, swim, ride our bikes, watch movies, share secrets, and have a million other adventures. Now, all they want to do is stay at home to play on the computer or be on their phones. I try to compromise with them by taking them to places that I think they'll like. For example, last weekend we went to Little Tokyo since they're into Anime. If felt like pulling teeth for them to agree to go, but they eventually did. Problem is, they were miserable the entire time there! I even offered to buy them whatever they wanted, along with letting them chose where to eat, and even so they whined and moaned the entire time there. I don't know what to do anymore. It upsets me that they're not willing to compromise with me, and this usually leads to fighting and me taking away their phones/computers, which of course makes them hate me even more. I miss the bond that we had, but I understand that they're growing up and want their space. I just hate that they're growing up :("
My cancer came back again.,"This time it's painful, and I'm going to have to have chemo and another lung surgery. :("
My friend just beat the shit out of this guy,"He just told me that it happened earlier today. 

It's his birthday. He went to the mall with his girlfriend. He tells me it was great. I ask, ""Yeah? Did you get any action?"" He says, ""No, I got to beat the shit out of my girlfriend's stalker."" Pause. ""What?""


He tells me that there's this guy who's ""been texting her"" and ""making her cry"" as of late. Apparently, he broke his nose and knocked a few teeth out. I ask how the fuck that ended up happening, and he tells me that his girl and him planned it. Pause. ""WHAT?"" He tells me he went to the mall, had his girl text this guy and have him ""meet her"" there. ""The rest is history,"" he says. 


Bewilderment is my initial reaction. Why? Because someone got their face smashed in for one. Why should that matter to me? Here's my worry: she fucking loved it. She probably suggested the idea. She probably told him, stop, he's had enough, please, stop...and relished the whole thing. 


My friend, he's very susceptible to control. If he says he likes cars, and I say I don't like cars, he'll reassure me that cars aren't all that great. 


When he tells me about this girl, I remember the little things. Things they do together, things that are always her idea. I'm worried about him. If what he did, he really did over some guy who apparently texted his girlfriend, then he does not have an breezy future with her. Especially if she keeps telling him that catalysts for drama made her ""cry."" 

I want to say something to him, but not the wrong thing. I'm afraid he'll get defensive. "
"I was ""duped"" twice in one month by guys who wanted to experience dating a foreigner.","I've (24F) never felt so naive and unconfident with my own judgement. There are times when I feel okay hanging out with friends and other people, but when I'm alone I can't sleep, I have no appetite, and I feel sick to my stomach. I just want to stop caring, but thoughts of it rise to the surface and just take over my body.

For background: I'm living in Japan, speak Japanese pretty well (better than the English of both these guys), am blonde and have a ""small face"" which is apparently attractive here. Both of these men are Japanese.

The first guy (32) is barely even worth mentioning because the whole situation was so ridiculous. Basically we dated for a week and he acted as though he really liked me. He was leaving in a week for a 4 month trip, so we both knew it was a fling. Two days before he left, he stood me up for a date (which was originally his idea) and then invited me to a barbecue where he proceeded to get all touchy feely with another girl right in front of me, knowing that I could see. I left, sent him a text saying telling him that he was an asshole and got no reply. That was the end of it and all of my Japanese roommates couldn't believe that this happened, and assured me that he was just an asshole and not typical.

Through some sort of ""when it rains it pours"" streak of luck, I met the second guy (27) on a meetup trip to a local mountain. We hit it off and it was obvious that we were both attracted to each other, and we arranged to do something together the next weekend. In the interim he was messaging me every second day, which to me is a little bit too much too soon. But out of consideration for cultural differences I didn't say anything.

 On the first date, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I said that it was a little bit fast and that we should get to know each other better first. I said this in English, and I guess it didn't make it through the language barrier, because later he thanked me for agreeing to be his girlfriend. Again I let it be due to cultural differences, knowing that dating moves a little faster in Japan than my home country. Then he started messaging me every day, at which point I was freaking out about the velocity of things. I didn't want to rush into a situation where I could hurt someone who really likes me, so I considered ending it. But I did have fun the other times I saw him, so I decided to go on one more date to see how I felt. On the next date, bam, I was completely infatuated with him. I asked him outright if he was dating me just because I was a foreign girl, and he said ""a little bit, but I do like you."" I was okay with this answer because honestly I wanted to experience dating a Japanese guy too ""a little bit.""

One week and a couple of sleepovers later I got the sense that something wasn't right. Then he cancelled a date saying he had to work and his messages became much more delayed that before. I asked him if something was up and after pressing a bit he confessed that he thought we had become too close too quickly and wanted to just be friends. I pointed out that this didn't make sense as he has been the one pursuing closeness from the beginning. In the end I got out of him that a) he didn't want to be friends or see me anymore and b) he had wanted to experience dating a foreign girl, but in the end realized that that wasn't a good sole reason to date someone, and when I had asked him about this before he gave me the answer I wanted to hear because he wanted to continue dating me. He apologized profusely, but the truth of the situation stands in stark contrast to the way I thought he actually felt.

In both cases I slept with them on the second or third date. I like sex, and I don't want to believe that I should be withholding it in order to keep someone's interest.

What's getting to me was that with the second guy, I was so sure he was a nice guy. I'm pretty sure that I'm done with dating for a while, but I don't know if I'll be able to trust someone next time, knowing that I was so wrong twice in a row.

TL;DR I've been completely thrown through a loop by two guys who dated me, all the while acting like they were 110% into me, and then did complete 180s.

I'm slowly killing myself,"The worst part of an addiction is the realization of self-deterioration, and not being able to stop yourself. For 3 years I have been caught in the repetitive hell of heroin addiction. My method of consumption is smoking instead of shooting, but that's no excuse. I have stolen from my parents, my brothers, and strangers. I have sold things that I held dearly, things that were given as gifts from loved ones, things that I missed as soon as I left the pawn shop. But it didn't matter, as long as I was on my way to meet my connect, I was okay. I'm tired. I'm exhausted of living like this, and I'm not even as bad as people I've come across. Every days is the same as the last, and the same as the next. You turn into the same person as everyone else in your situatuon. You live for your next high, and that's it. Nothing else matters. But it does to me. I'm still young, and I don't want to end my potential at a decent life when I know I hold the power to change it. I'm tired of hating myself, being mad at myself for putting myself in the position I'm in today. I have no one to blame to me, and that's what bothers me the most. Tomorrow is going to be different. And people may not believe that, but they don't have to. I only have to convince one person that I'm through with this part of my life... Me. Here goes nothing. "
My job is making me racist.,"Backstory: I'm an 18 year old male bartender in small town louisiana (that's why I'm so young). It's a predominately black bar so there's constantly rap music blaring, which doesn't bother me all that much. What does bother me is most of the patrons. Mostly 20-30 something year old black men. Now I've never been one for racism but these people are fucking dumb. Could be the alcohol or the drugs that they do IN THE FUCKING BAR! Which is right across the street from a police station. For some reason these people who are ignorant to begin with, get even more ignorant and loud. I cannot sit here without judging these people. And it's sad because I know it's just the alcohol and drugs, but my biggest problem is WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU BLOWING ALL YOUR MONEY HERE!? I KNOW most of them have children and no job. So why are you here paying $5 for a shot of ciroc? Take care of your goddamn kids. Get out of the bar. And act your fucking age. 



I don't know what to do anymore. I feel bad for hating these people, but I do. And it's not all black people just the ones who come here.

"I asked this girl out, got rejected","And I'm fine with it. She said we can remain friends and I am really happy about it. Really, I knew she would say no, but I knew I needed to get her off my mind and move on; they only way to do that was to hear if she recuperated those feelings back to me. Now though, whenever I try to text her she doesn't respond; whenever I try to talk to her, I can feel how uncomfortable she is. I want things to return to how they were before I started becoming interested in her, but I am afraid that will never happen. I'm suppose to go to prom with her, but I feel as if I fucked everything up and eventually she will just disappear from my life after that. I feel like she doesn't even want to be around me anymore.   "
My relationship came to an end today.,"A few days ago I posted here about how I wasn't sure about my relationship anymore. I was with my girlfriend for 2 years and a few months. The passion wasn't there anymore and there had been a strong disconnect between us recently. I loved her though and she was the biggest part of my life. 

Today she took it upon herself to end things. In all honesty I was prepared for this for like a week just waiting for her to speak up. She had been slowly moving her things out of my house that she kept there for awhile to her place and was essentially erasing all traces of her ever being there little by little.

She started our day by texting me the infamous ""We need to talk"". I already knew what was about to happen. So I drove up to her place and was ready to settle the matter in her driveway but she insists we drive to a park all the way across town. I'm thinking ""Seriously?"" 

So we get all the way there and I ask her to just be out with it. I was ready to just rip the band-aid off because I'm not the type to want to sit there and drown in our collective sorrow. She began to cry and told me she couldn't do this anymore. She said she loved me but wasn't *IN* love with me. So I figured that was that. The band-aid had come off and I was ready to bring her home for the last time. That's when she started adding some insult to injury about telling me that I have no drive to be successful and that I was dead weight dragging her behind.  

I thought this break up was going to be a quick and clean mutual agreement for a healthy break. Turned out to be a few stabs at me with salt rubbed in the wounds. It was a highly emotional moment for us both so I wasn't about to pull out my arsenal of ways to crush *her* feelings as well. I decided to stick to ripping the band-aid off. She was still sobbing heavily and I knew it was hard on her so I drove us through the nearest drive-thru at Mcdonalds and bought her a large sweet tea and drove her back home. I made sure she had all her things and told her ""See you."" as she exited my car. 

Alongside my mild sadness I feel a bit relieved that I'm back to being single. However, I feel more lost than I have ever been. I don't know how to begin this next era in my life or even how to effectively enjoy being alone after being in such a serious relationship the past couple of years.

I'm becoming a hater,"I've always been taught to respect people as if they were myself, to give them the same treatment I'd like to have from them. I've spent almost my entire life looking for my ""spiritual path"" (and I think I found it), and so on.

At an early age I found out myself as gay (I mean: when I was 4 or 5 years old), and due to the education I had I used to see myself as filthy, sinner. More than that I used to think that the right woman would be able to put my homosexuality in a ""dormant"" state. I got married at 23 y.o., and divorced at 27. Then I had my first contact with another man, and, well, I discovered where my pleasure and my happiness dwell.

At that point I realized that being gay was not a problem to me, and I love myself as a gay man. But at the same time I realized that a large number of people hate gays just because they do, and I started to develop a hidden hate for all heterosexual people, including my relatives.

A few years in therapy and I got rid of this generalized hate. But the hate for religious people that label themselves as ""christians"", improved. I know I hate them because I fear them. I am always afraid of going out and being attacked by some homophobic jerk. If I could, I'd move to some gay community somewhere, but at this point I can't afford it yet.

But what's actually bothering me is: in a rational level I know nobody would attack me (because of my appearance, my size, my ""bad guy mood"", whatever), and those intolerant religious people deserve pity, or maybe just contempt; I know this hate I see everywhere is just a projection of my own hate and I don't know what to do with it.

I'd really like to be a better person for me, for my partner, for my mother and brother, and for all the rest of the world, but hating people because of their believes just makes me a hater, someone I don't like to be.

**TL; DR: I'm becoming a hater, specially against religious people.**"
I just wanted to talk to my Reddit. (Cross post from rbi),"My best friend, my heart, my husband was diagnosed yesterday with melanoma in his eye. It's a pretty substantial sized tumor. He went to the doctor for an eye exam last Friday because his felt he needed prescription glasses instead of the readers he was using and instead of a prescription for glasses he was told he had a mass in his eye and was given an appointment to see a retina speciality doctor on Monday. We both went to that appointment and were told the bad news. The doctor there called Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia and made an appointment for the 20th. The options are radiation of the tumor if it is not too big or removal of his eye. 

So here we are in the midst of piles of paperwork, many phone calls, and way too many tears. 

He and I met 20 years ago on an old school social media site called Imagination Network. We played cards on that place together and chatted for months before we met and I fell in love with him immediately. He is, without exaggeration, the sweetest man I have ever known and I have always felt I did not deserve such a great guy. 

I just want you to keep him in your thoughts. He has been by my side for years as I have gone through chemo treatments and a million doctor appointments for my own cancer. I have non Hodgkin lymphoma in my bone marrow. I wish with every fiber of my being that this cancer he has could be my cancer to deal with. 

We live in SC and are not what you would call worldly. I've only been on a plane twice in my life. We have contacted a group that gives free plane rides to cancer patients if there is a corporate plane traveling with open seats on that day to that destination, but the odds of that aren't in our favor but who knows, we may get lucky. Either way we have air fare but isn't it heartwarming to know there is such a program? 

I know I have rambled and putting this in Reddit opens me up to possible cruelty but I've seen too many sweet people here let the bad people stop me from posting. 

You don't know us, but please, send good thoughts our way. Know that I am overwhelmed with paperwork, phone calls, appointments, work, and general planning to be on here too much but I will check in when I can. 

Much love to you, and tell that person, you know who, that you love them. 

Checking in: just finished with hubby having a complete physical at the family doctor. Three hours worth of complete. Blood work, of course, not back but initial physical came out great. Final able to get something to eat and it was a huge breakfast. Uggg we are both full. Time to go home and deal with some insurance calls, paperwork, and another call to the hotel. I know I will sound horribly ignorant but I don't know how to make reservations correctly which makes me worry even further about doing things as simple as getting a cab once we are in Philadelphia. I want my hubby as comfy as possible as I remember a post about possible upgrades at a hotel.... maybe someone might give me a little guidance on that one? "
King hit on the Gold Coast,"Peoples aggressive behaviour is getting out of control.
I am typically a very placid person and not aggressive at all, so when I was at a club on the Gold Coast of Australia and was ""king hit"" from behind for no known reason I just couldn't believe it had happened.
I didn't know the guy, speak 2 words to him or anything so when the police asked why he did it I couldn't give them an answer.
He fractured my jaw and smashed 3 of my teeth with over 10k worth of dental work I have to pay for (which I can't afford). 
What is the go with these people? I know it might seem a little dramatic but this guy could have killed me and that is really scary.

Just something I need too get off my chest,"So going back 3 years I was a happy, confident, fun loving person. I always had a joke, rarely ever got upset. I was however incredibly overweight and a size 20. Something needed to be done and I decided that losing weight was something I desperately needed to do. So I didn't look back- joined a gym, restricted my calories and ate clean. 1 year later and I'd lost 4 stone 56 pounds and at around a size. I felt great, compliments were flying, people no longer called me fat. I had relationship offers from people I'd never have expected. 

Being a food lover I piled a stone and a half back on and felt crap again. I could feel myself spiralling out of control back to my fat self. I decided to diet again and I again restricted calories and started exercising once more.

Right fast forward 1 year and my total weight loss is 70lbs and I'm a size 6-8. It has its ups, I grt looks walking down the street, quite a few people have shown interest and I hace a lovely boyfriend that has stuck by me throughout my weight loss.
However I am totally not happy. I can't drink with my friends as I am to scared of the calories which will make me gain weight. People think I am boring now and the truth is it's true. I can no longer be that bubbly person, I don't have the energy for it.
I hate food, it's my best friend and my worst enemy. I'vw always loved cakes and sweets and seeing everyone else eat them is a struggle.
My family aren't exactly supportive and I have done this all on my own.

I am constantly cold due to being now. People are always moaning that all I ever talk about is calories and exercise but it has become my life.

I am aware this is obsessive and I wish I could change it. However the thought of gaining weight puts me in a state of panic and I know that I will be stuck in this dilema for the rest of my life.

My mother allowed my grandmother to die slowly without telling me a thing.,"2 years ago at 4am on the 30th of October 2011, my grandmother succumbed to her lung cancer and passed away age 65 with family members surrounding her, except for me. 

Now what you have to understand is that, my grandmother and I had a very special and strong relationship, probably equal to or stronger than with my own mother as we bonded on every level, especially sport but sadly she supported Liverpool which was a downside.

Now it turns out that my 'Nana' as I called her, had been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and given less than a year to live. Over this period I later learned she deteriorated more and more as my mother decided to feed me with lies that she was constantly having bad stomach problems, headaches etc and i was naive to it the entire time, which led to me not even visiting her once as I strongly believed she was ok and that nothing was wrong. 

So on the day before Halloween which I was so excited for, my friends mother even drove to the local skate park to tell me that I had to go home because Nana 'wasnt doing the best'. So she drives me to where my dad is waiting and i get into the car and say ""What is it is Nana ok?"" , to which he replies ""Nana died this morning"".

I was in shock, no tears the entire period of grieving, the wake, the funeral, afterwards, nothing at all. It was only one day that I was eavesdropping on my granddad speaking to my mum and he told her he had ""nothing to live for"" and ""wanted to join her"", as they had been married for 50 years and he now lives alone in a very rural part of Ireland, that I realised what had happened and I broke down.

My mother tries to console me that she 'didn't want me to be upset' and that 'it would've only caused me pain' sorry what? I never got to even say fucking goodbye to her and she decided to hold the 'burden' of not telling me? Although my initial rage has passed I still have a massive grudge to this day that I cannot let go of, that my Nana went through the final stages of her life without me there to even say one word to her."
I fell in love with a girl who I know will never love me.,That sums it up. I just had to tell someone. I suck at this and talking and stuff and my feelings suck too
My mother died and me and my dad need serious help (X-post from r/offmychest),"I posted the following text in r/offmychest at about 3am when I was struggling to contain my feelings.  I'd like to ask for any help on the issue. Sorry it's all fragmented and badly written I wasn't in a good place. 


My mother died in July. I haven't cried since the funeral. I'm not holding it in, the tears just won't come. Of course I'm sad but nothings happening. She was the most important thing in my life and she never got to say goodbye to me. My father is worse. So much worse. He just lies in bed crying for hours at a time and the rest of the time he's struggling to keep calm. I can't take it any more but I can't abandon him and I'm scared to talk to him about our future cos he'll either scream or cry. He's in a lot of physical pain too and every moan and whine is like a knife jammed into my ear, and his crying is like a knife through my heart. I comfort him when I can but it's getting too much for me. He's had problems for years. I have no siblings to confide in and the rest of my family live many miles away. It's like I lost my dad too. He sleeps in the front room on the sofa instead of a proper bed. He stays up until 5 in the morning. The house is a fucking mess and has been all my life. I'm pretty sure he's a hoarder. Not as bad as the ones on TV but pretty bad. It's mainly laziness opposed to emotional attachment. I think he was depressed since before I was born. I feel horrible for trying to pursue my own needs in the face of his condition and it causes tension between us but I can't ignore my own health. Every conversation we have runs the risk of turning into a shouting match. I expect this and I shut down during the conversation and struggle to answer his questions. This just makes him angrier. He says we both have a part to play in our difficulty in communicating but a lot of them would go away if he didn't talk to me like I was five fucking years old. I'm 24 and living at home with a degree that won't get me anywhere. I have no experience that'll get me a job in somewhere I want to be. I desperately want to work in the arts in some way. I know what I need to do but I don't have the motivation to do it and living in my shithole house doesn't help. Everyone I know has some great passion that they throw themselves into but I have so many interests that I don't know where to use my time. I want to do everything and thus do nothing. I feel like I have the motivation levels of somebody who just smokes pot all day. I hate myself. I'm a total virgin and I don't feel the slightest bit attractive to girls. I hate my body. I'm making steps to be healthier and I'm learning the guitar. I'm also learning to drive. I hope that'll mean good things in the future if I keep this up, my brain says otherwise but I tell myself to keep going because what's the alternative? Normally I would apologise for feeling sorry for myself but fuck that. Normally I'd worry too much about the quality of my writing but fuck that too. If you're gonna give me abuse then to hell with you. If you read this or even want to comment positively then thank you.

Peace."
I feel like I'm just waiting for time to pass.,"I'm not happy. I do things I enjoy doing, but I'm not happy. I'm lonely, I'm shy, and feel like I make terrible, boring conversation. I have friends, and generally people like me, but I don't think I'm that great of a person. I sometimes have verbal diarrhea. I can't make new friends and if I do it relies heavily on the other person to approach me for the friendship. I'm lazy and have no idea what to do for a career. I find life too hard to deal with and I lack confidence to put myself out there. My girlfriend of almost 9 years left me for a multitude of reasons for which I don't blame her. I was happy while with her but I think she was just a bandaid for my larger problems and now that she is gone I can't stand myself. I don't know how anyone could put up with me really. I mean, yeah I get along with people and I can be funny but once it's a real friendship or relationship, I feel so boring and miserable, so unable to relate with. I think my ex feels like I was boring and a waste of time, unable to grow up and be a man. I'm broke and almost 30. I'm really just a loser who is worse off than when he graduated high school. I haven't even gone to college. I think I just wasn't made for this world. I can't compete. I think I shouldn't have children so that I don't pass on my terrible genes. I don't want to kill myself or hurt my family or friends but if I didn't wake up tomorrow I wouldn't complain. "
"Have my first serious girlfriend, but I hate my appearance","A little background - I'm in Grade 11 of High School, and I'm a guy. So, I've been dating a girl for about three weeks now. That's longer than any relationship I've ever had. The only other two have ended really quickly. I'm also going farther with this girl. So far we've only made out, but that's even more than I've done before. The thing is - I am kinda fat. The problem is that you can't tell unless I'm naked. With a shirt and jeans on, I look fairly skinny. The second those come off, my stomach hangs out and my thighs squeeze up against each other. So I'm worried that if I do go all the way with this girl, she'll be grossed out by the fact that I'm actually fat. Any advice would be much appreciated, it's the only thing I can think about when I'm with her right now."
"Long distance relationship problems, he says he doesn't want to do it.","Ok... This is kind of long story but I think it will help me feel better just getting it out. Thanks for listening.

I am a 24 year old female and he is 23 and just starting a two year grad program 1,000 miles away. We met a year ago and started dating exclusively shortly afterward. He knew he would be moving away 9 months after we met, and told me from the beginning he does not ever want to be in a long distance relationship. I was fine with this because I figured we would just deal with it later if it is still an issue. I put the thought of him leaving out of my mind so I could enjoy the time we did have.
 
We fell in love, I've met his family and I love them and they like me too, we have had a really good relationship-- I really do think he is someone I could marry. We have talked about marriage, and he's said that he thinks we could get married if we spend a couple years together (in the same city) and things are still great.

This is not my first serious relationship, and I know what I want out of a relationship, and though we do have some communication problems, I KNOW that this is something I want to be in. 

I graduated from college a year ago, and during that time I have applied for jobs in my field in my town and had no luck. I started applying for work in the city he is going to grad school a few months ago, but I had no luck there either. Two weeks ago, I got a job offer in my area (finally!) and I took it. It is a really great job, and it would be best for my career to keep for a couple years at least.

I don't have the money to move to where he is, or I would have gone with him. I have to buy a used car and have the money to move before I can go. I think it will take me about 9 months to save up enough to move there, and at that time he will be (hopefully) going abroad for an internship, or maybe somewhere else in the US.

We have spent 3 months apart so far, and we have seen each other 2 times. The last time was a month ago, I stayed with him and his family for a week just before he moved to where the school is. It was a really wonderful visit. He was very loving and we were equally excited to be with each other. Everything he did and said made me think that he would be ok with doing long distance for a while until i can afford to move down there. He has had his moments this summer where he gets really overwhelmed with the thought of not knowing how long we will be apart and having an open ended LDR (this was before i got that job). 

Last night we were talking on the phone and I could tell he had something on his mind and asked him what was bothering him. We talked for about 2 hours and he said that he doesn't think LDRs work, he's been in two of them before, and this one has a 1 year minimum and that is too much for him. 

And the way he talked about this upset me the most. He basically said that he's reduced this relationship to numbers and he doesn't see any way it can work. I feel that I am up to the challenge, and I realize how tough it will be, but I love him dearly and am determined to make it work. He said he didn't see how his feelings about me were relevant to the situation, either, when I asked how he felt about me and losing me and all that stuff. 

He is a very mathematical and logical person, and isn't as emotional as I am. The conversation ended up with us deciding to ""take a break"" for 3 months and then reevaluate how long it will take for me to move there, and how we feel about that. I think breaks are kind of stupid- usually they prolong a breakup that is already going to happen. The only reason I agreed to that is because the alternative is to break up. Which he was pretty much asking for us to do.

I had the last word in our conversation, it wasnt angry or anything. I think it struck a cord, because he called back and said he was sorry that this conversation went poorly and asked that we not do the break that night, and asked if we could talk today and figure this out. He was showing some emotion at this point. I agreed to that. 

I KNOW that it's probably a bad idea to try to talk someone out of a breakup. If someone doesn't want to be in a relationship with me, I usually let them go. But this is a case of the circumstances of our lives getting in the way, and the fact that we are so damn compatible and great together and we love each other shouldn't be taken lightly by either of us, i think. I think it's worth us fighting for. He is putting it all on me, i feel. I could save up just enough to go down there and try to wing it, but I want to be responsible and not piss off my family by just following my heart with no regard for the responsible thing to do. I told my boyfriend i would leave this great job to be with him, but I am really conflicted about that too. I am choosing him over my career. I would happily do this, though, if it meant we would be together from here on out.

This is also bothering me: I have never lived farther than a 50 mile radius of where I grew up and i really DO want to leave and see the world. If I am with him I will have the chance to do that. He wants to travel and he will have the means to do so after school.

We are about to talk on the phone again. I hope it goes well. I don't want to lose him, but if that's what needs to happen, so be it. Wish me luck. Thank you.

**TL;DR Our relationship is victim of poor timing. He doesn't want to be in a LDR and I am doing all I can to move there but it will be months before that happens.**

"
Friend of mine came to me saying he hit his girlfriend,"So an old friend came to me saying he had to get something off his chest. Not too long ago, he had physically harmed his girlfriend in a few instances, once in self-defense and once as the initial instigator. He showed true remorse in his actions, though said he is afraid of what he is capable of, and it sounded like he isn't sure if he will be able to prevent himself from doing it in the future.

I'm no mental health expert, but we've talked about issues he's had with his dad and how he treated his mom, so I encouraged him to not hate himself for it, but took a soft yet firm anti-abuse stance, urging him that if he isn't sure that if he isn't sure that he can control himself next time, to do whatever he could to prevent a situation like that from happening, even if that meant breaking up with his girlfriend. He's had some issues with mental health in the past, but this is the first time he's told me that he physically hurt someone. He's my friend and I love him, but I am worried that he could let his anger get out of hand. I know someone else who was a victim of abuse, and I want to do what I can to make sure it doesn't continue. He's had on and off mental health issues, going through several therapists in the past, and I worry about him. No matter what, I'll be there for him, but I want to make sure that I'm there for him in the right way. Is there anything else I could do for him, or say to him?"
How do I tell my parents I have depression,"I’m so scared to tell them, they can be difficult most of the time and they don’t really understand a lot of English. For about the past 5 months I’ve been depressed and having anxiety, I no longer feel like this but I don’t feel the same I’m not the same person, I’m not funny or witty anymore, it’s hard for me to find words, I can barely socialize normally now, my speech is a little impaired, my head has this weird feeling and whenever I shake my head I feel some sort of pain, and the most obvious sign is that I can easily get a song stuck in my head. 

I’ve mostly been depressed over a girl, yeah I know, but I’ve been feeling lonely and distancing myself from my friends cause of anxiety and the constant thought of not being the funny witty guy anymore and not having anything to talk about. I couldn’t even do my school work, I haven’t been watching any shows or youtubers that I used to watch when I was still in school. and to be honest I’m not even sure why I’m depressed and had anxiety anymore."
I don't agree with this person but to defend my point would mean absolute chaos,"I might just end up deleting this later, but it's really bothering me right now and I don't think I can talk about it to anybody without it getting back to them. 

I have a friend. They're not financially well off. They like to talk about it a lot. They live with roommates, all of which work regular 9-5 jobs. They do not. They have ways they make money, but none are sustainable or consistent (thankfully they're not into mlms if that's what you're wondering, I'm just trying to remain vague). I see their roommates putting out their gofundme's for doctor appointments and fixing their cars. What does my friend ask for? Hobby supplies. New electronics. You get the idea. They have the nerve to try and blame every single one of their problems on the corporations and the government and what have you, and I get it. I'm anti-establishment, I wish I didn't have to work under a corporate-mandated system or kiss ass for my shitty paycheck but that's the only option I have. That's the only option most people have. And you know what? Some of those people end up moving out of their shit hole apartments and moving on to better places. It's broken, its backwards, but if it's food and Healthcare you need, you can't just wait around and hope that it'll be handed to you. I sympathize so deeply. There isn't a moment that I don't worry about what will happen to me if my current situation falls apart, but I'm not at people's doorsteps arguing about how privileged and gross people are because they live in a house instead of a rinky dink apartment. 

Cuz that's what my friend is doing. All they do is talk about how many meals they had this week and how they were soooooo pissed that they had to drive past a nice neighborhood to run an errand. Are you really that jealous and petty? They started making videos about and people called their bluff saying that not everyone they're angry at is a shitty, one-percent old white man who never knew poverty (and of course many were unkind and insulting but a lot of them were just honestly confused and hurt by their words). And what does my friend do? Screenshots their comments and talks about how much hate and ugliness they're getting from voicing an opinion. 

And honestly? I don't want to hear it anymore. I admire my friend's creativity and personality but this misguided (amd frankly hypocritical) hate is so much. And they have so many people rallied around them that if I so much as say that they're wrong that their friends and roommates will gather around and burn me at the stake. 

I just wanted to talk is all. I'm so tired. I have a headache. If no one sees this I'll probably delete it anyway."
Feeling behind,"I'm only 20(f), and my boyfriend is only 23, but I can't help but feel like I'm floating around like a lost kid, just following his lead. Right before covid hit he landed this great new job with great income. Now that our state is reopening, he travels weekly for work as was orginally planned when he took the offer. I miss him, but I'm realizing I'm basically his puppy. I don't have a job so he tends to support me a lot while I'm trying to find one for the summer. My friends and I lost most contact when we all went separate ways for college. I try to keep planning things with them and keep in touch, but they're a bit unresponsive, even more so now that the plague is going around. As a result I've been spending more time talking to bf friend's and gaming with them online. They're cool and I think they don't mind me hanging around, but it's kinda obvious that they tend to think of me as X's girlfriend, rather than someone they can just be a friend to. Now that he's out of town, I'm realizing how lonely I am. I don't really know how to fix it. I've tried joining public discords involving things I'm interested in, but there tend to be so many people in those that anything I say gets drowned out. I was starting to make friends at college but then everything became online and I lost touch with them. My options are limited right now and I just feel like a pathetic lost puppy dog."
"I’m ready to date, but I’m scared because of my last relationship","I want to try dating again, but I’m terrified of winding up in a relationship like my last one. My last relationship was not good, looking back on it, I was always pushed to the wayside. My ex and I would plan dates, usually on skype because we were long distance, and then at the last moment, she would tell me that her friends wanted to hang out and do X. This would’ve been fine if it were just a couple of times, but it would happen about 90% of the time. I get it, I really do, you want to hang out with your friends, but this is the issue: you can’t expect a relationship to last if you don’t put any time, care, or love into it. I mentioned it from time to time, and things would get better for a few days, then go right back to before, I was upset and sick of it, but I didn’t want to break it off because, “what if this is my one chance at love,” so I would bear with it. Then when I went to see her for a date we had planned for months, I traveled 100+ miles to go see her, and she bailed on me. I started to get fed up with it then, and then a few weeks later she called and broke up with me on the phone. A couple of months later, we started talking again, trying to make things work, and then things went on like that for a couple of years, talking on and off. Eventually I got fed up with it and told her that I never wanted to be in a relationship ever again, but the relationship itself left bad scars on my confidence, my sense of self worth, and my ability to open up to others in a romantic relationship. I’m scared that the same thing will happen again now with my future relationships, and I’m scared that maybe I’m not good enough"
I feel like I can enjoy nothing anymore,"I feel like I can enjoy nothing  anymore other than looking forward to thinks hoping that I'll enjoy them. There are things that I kinda enjoy but they feel nothing like they felt in the past. Communicating with people is not the same anymore. Talking to friends is not the same. Doing things I like is not the same. Even surfing the internet is not the same. Nothing is the same. It doesn't feel pleasant enough or pleasant at all anymore. Not even expressing my feelings while writing this right now.

I want to fix this. I want to enjoy life and be happy and healthy. I want to do many things in this life, but recently I am feeling unmotivated to live. Not suicidal. I'm too afraid of death to kill myself and there is a voice in my head telling me ""no, don't kill yourself, just in case you'll have things to enjoy"".

 My social life isn't as good as it was anymore and I don't enjoy conversations anymore. I feel like I have no need to communicate with anyone. All I do is work (school) 12 - 14 hours a day, sometimes less and then I have no motivation to do anything else other than surf the internet or read books and usually I don't read books because I've read all the books I own and because it'd easier to find stuff to read that you are interested in on the internet. I think this is getting serious.

I have lots of plans for the future, I want to learn foreign languages, gain more knowledge, go on mission trips, become a social worker, a nurse or a doctor and devote my life to serving God and others, becoming a competitive dancer, writing novels, yet I'm so unmotivated to enjoy anything anymore. I'm looking for joy and I can't seem to find it. I won't tell it to my grandma whom I live with, because she will worry too much about m and won't understand me, because she thinks I'm satisfied when I'm not. I can't say life sucks , it's not good, but it's bearable. Time seems to fly too fast. That breaks my nerves. And also scares me.

I don't fear my life ending, because I believe in an afterlife and when I feel like I haven't gotten enough of life, it reassures me that I will get some day. Not that I won't enjoy life in this world, I can't just stay unhappy for 75 to 80 years, my goal is to live happy regardless of where I am.

I want to fix this. I want something, some hope. Anything. I want to be able to enjoy communicating again. And I also want things to enjoy, passions, those are the things that motivate me to live.

I absolutely hate it when mean people tell me not to believe in God just because they think it's all a fairytale that only hurts people and produces extremism. Surprise surprise, I am not a fundamentalist Christian, I believe in evolution, I support gay rights and in fact I am asexual biromantic myself, I believe women can be priests, I don't believe women's bodies are inherently sexual hidden objects that must be hidden I don't force women to obey men, I dojt believe women's ""role"" is to never have the right to be visible in society or church as working women or priests/pasotds and I don't try to find apologetic justifications to biblical genocide and slavery. I don't hurt anyone with my beliefs nor my reason and my  critical thinking is not hurt by them. 

I also don't believe that we're all inherently evil people like American evangelicalism suggests, I am Anglican (kind of) not an evangelical. I don't tell  people ""were all awful people that deserve to die"". I do believe that there are serious issues with our society, and I do believe we're bad people, but we're also both, we are neither intently good nor inherently bad, we're simply good in some areas of life and assholes in other areas. And most people I've met are surprisingly decent in lots of areas, if not decent, then they're average. 

They should know that what I believe makes me happy, helps me be a better person, and since I am one of the people who rarely feel guilt, not by choice, but because of brain stuff or something, God has helped me feel more accountable when I do bad things. He is the first person that I talk to when I am worried and sad and he is the one that motivates  me at least a little bit during life and makes me feel like ""yes, it's all gonna be okay, things are getting better, just keep trying, I am always there and the world you live in is the best possible world. Life is a wonder and you are  lucky to wake up every morning. There are things that matter in this world and I'm there to help you find joy in them. It's okay when you make mistakes, I'll forgive you"". They just don't understand how even if religion causes harm, if we treat it properly it does just as much goof and is a necessity for some people.

My therapist attempted to make me an atheist, multiple times and I had to play dumb/without lgoic/""God works in mysterious ways"" or use the best but most understandable arguments I have for what I believe, because if I explained myself I thought she wouldn't understand. I also pretended to be a biblical litsralist because if I explained her my ""liberal"" beliefs she would try to debate me and I hate debates. They are annoyed when people push their beliefs on them yet some of them do the same thing to us.

My faith is the only glimpse of hope in my life, and even if I had other glimpses of hope I would still keep it, not for personal gain, but because it's just a part of my lifestyle and who I am. I wasn't raised this way, I became religious by choice and I was a very very strong  atheist and naturalist beforehand. We ex atheists are seen as impossible, people just think that there is only one rational worldview and that the rest of religions are full of holes that don't make sense. Surprise, just because it doesn't make sense to a group of people it doesn't mean that it doesn't make sense to everyone. 

I want a better life, more passion for it, that's all. I can't live the rest of my days like this, I can't die waiting for something better, I want to leave this world saying ""yep, this was nice, I am happy with it"".

I hope things will get better. Please tell me how to fix this because I cannot remain like that for too long.  I hate how my grandma yesterday gave me a specific time limit of how much time I can't spend on the internet, the internet was one of the only things I could kind of enjoy if I tried, I need to keep myself occupied somehow. I can't have after-school activities, because I have to have one to one math classes cause I suck at math for two hours two times a week. Maybe next year I will start rhythmic gymnastics. I will convince my grandma. I think spending too much time alone because of shunning by classmates (now I am not shunned or hated , I am just not really liked by anyone except than one person, who is much different than me) and too much time doing homework has made me forget how to have fun. Please pray for me, please give me advice. I need some help.

I'm also worried that when my grandma dies, I won't cry. I'm worried that I don't love her. When my grandpa died, I took it very lightly, although yes it bothered me, and the thing is that I had nightmares of loosing him before he died when I was six. I had also had nightmares that grandma and grandpa are replaced by clones or that they get clones while they are still alive but that was years ago. I am worried I can't love and I want to make sure that I love grandma before dh leaves. Send fucking help please. I wanna talk to a therapist. Thanks for the help bye."
I feel so fucking lonely,"Okay before writing this I'd like to tell you that everything I will tell here is totally true except some details I modified to not be doxed. If you don't trust me don't mention it just go away. I excuse myself because I don't speak english very well and because I don't really know reddit, just what people says about it but I've never gone here before. I am sorry if I don't post on the right subreddit, I'll probably flood.

My name is Pierre, I am a french boy. I am 15. I am very good at school with like 17/20 at every test, I have a girlfriend even she's ugly and I don't love her. I like programming, cybersec, philosophy, my PC. Following tests made IRL I do have moren than 149 IQ points, following internet tests and my own opinion I am an INTJ and I could be sadic and with antisocial troubles even if no one thinks it, evryone thinks I am just a kind of Einstein. If you see me IRL you'll just say ""This guy is super intelligent and very introverted, maybe strange"" 

IRL I do not really have friends, I've tryed before but they communicate as if communicating was the very purpose of their communication.

In fact, I don't really care about them and at best I ignore them, at worst they bother me. I point out that it is exactly the same for all members of my family. I use the internet a lot, especially the discords and 4chan. Even if it makes me laugh sometimes I find there also uninteresting people. Well, that was my little presentation: what I am, how I function socially.

The problem is that for about 4 weeks I have been crying every night at home for about an hour 20 to an hour 40 before sleeping.

I believe I have identified the cause of this shit: I believe that I feel alone. When I cry, I wonder why I am so different, why no one seems to suit me. I tried to sleep with my girlfriend in my arms but I wanted to physically hurt her (I already have sadistic behaviors during sex with her, she accepts it completely). For these few weeks, my sadistic impulses have intensified, I have developed a paranoia that comes periodically, I have become completely obsessed with cleanliness, I feel both empty and angry, I have done 3 episodes sleep paralysis.

I'm absolutely terrified, I tried to smoke weed to calm me down but it didn't do ANYTHING for me, usually in a situation of intense stress I do math and it ends up happening but there during the crisis c is absolutely impossible, I can't think.

This morning I heard a vox screaming in pain in my head, it passed quickly.

I am absolutely terrified, I do not know what is happening to me I am going to go crazy my state is getting worse and worse every day. With COVID 19, I will have to stay at home (I live in France) and I know that I will really become crazy without school to keep my mind occupied.

 I'm absolutely terrified, I don't know what's happening to me, I beg you HELP ME."
Perfectionism is a bitch,"I’m tired of trying to be perfect. It takes over everything I do and I feel like I’m not living. I’m recent months, it’s put me into a depressive state. I’ve been trying my hardest to get out of it, and I’ve been having good days recently. But on bad days it feels so heavy. The perfectionism is a gut reaction and NOTHING is good enough. Things are ok but I feel like I can’t measure up to whatever idealized bullshit I concocted. It’s been over a decade and I realize now that all I really want isn’t to be perfect but to be ok with being imperfect. Being okay with that is so much easier said than done though. I’m trying. The fact that I posted this is me trying."
Scared of my future,"sorry for that shitload of text

17M, from Russia and im really afraid of whats gonna happen to me when i graduate from school and in the next 1-2 years. 

3 months before the exams and im still very bad at what im currently studying (ive picked computer science, math and english as a planb). Im sure i can enter my local university but my town is just a shithole, friends of mine would go to Saint-Petersburg and a perspective of living alone in fucking Cherepovets and having no one to spend time with scares the shit out of me. 

i tried to start preparing more and having a schedule but when i try i just get scared of the amount of shit i have to master or i just practice something and then think that its enough studying for today (most of the time such ""practice"" just gets left in the past). 

i have a large passion on playing electric guitar and customizing clothing  and these things really bring me happiness. i have a couple of good friends i like to hang out with as well. The problem is i always choose to entertain myself instead of trying to focus on exams and picking between universities.my  focus is always on some art or entertainment BS like youtube, music bands, custom clothing, movies etc. i know a lot of info on such things but this just wont make any sense to me if i want to safely continue life without having to worry about finding a job or having no place of accomodation. my other problem is that many times id love to write a song or to design a clothing piece but every time i try to put my artistic thoughts into something i start thinking about exams being right behind my back and i just lose myself in figuring out what i should do first.

 right now my knowledge of computer science and english is waaay not enough to have a life where i wont bother too much and would have enough free time to really put all of  my artistic thoughts into music or clothing. i can master my skills of creating music or i can invest my moms money into making clothes and try to sell them but imo at the end of the day its only luck when it comes to making money on such things. i really want to start improving my knowledge but most of the time i just sit on my ass wanting to do shit and at the end of the  day i have nothing but controversies in my head.

i dont want to be all that successful and wealthy. i think my most cherished and desired wish is not bother too much about job and spend most of my free time hanging out with friends, play guitar and all that stuff. but when it comes to buying essentials, paying rent, having enough money to buy new equipment and enough time to master my art, i think that only a well-paid job with high entry threshold can provide me all of these things at the same time. but even if i start studying and having schedules i will probably get lost in it, spend all my time studying or working and have no time for life and it just sucks

 most of the time im happy with myself and free in things i do but it is only possible because its my parents  who pay the rent. what should i do reddit?  sry for bad punctuation, poor english and tautology"
"Overweight and in constant pain, but everyone around me seems to think it's my fault?","Hi all, first time poster so please go easy on me.

My problem is simple: I'm 5""5, and I weigh 14 stone. According to the BMI, this means I am obese. For me, it means I'm fat, plain and simple.

Unlucky for me though, I have ongoing health problems that have been troubling me since I first hit puberty. This just so happened to be only a year or so before I started gaining weight.

Everyone in my life is constantly suggesting I'll feel better if I just lose some weight. The thing is, I've faced eating disorders multiple times now, and while it has never gotten dangerous, it is still a mentality that I could easily fall prey to again. Not only that, but I'm certain my health problems began before I gained weight, and may even be the cause of the weight gain, as exercise in general is extremely painful, and has been for years.

Despite this, the suggestion continues to be to just push through it, and if I lose some weight then I'll stop being in pain.

This endless cycle is really starting to get to me. I'm starting to think there's no end in sight. According to friends, family, and even one of the doctors I have seen recently, the only way to stop being in pain is to lose weight, but the only way I can do that is by doing the thing that causes me pain.

This catch 22 is really getting me down, and I just need someone to tell me this isn't all in my head, and I should just get over myself.

Thank you if you made it this far"
Didn’t get either of my majors at my dream school and I don’t really know what to do...,"     I have wanted to be an engineer for the best part of my life, and I fell in love with Biology and natural processes during high school, so I applied to the biomedical engineering major at the University of Texas at Austin. I thought I had a fairly decent chance of getting my major as I worked hard throughout high school and earned a rank of 9/385 + a 35 on my ACT. I also participated in various extracurriculars such as Orchestra for 7 years and playing Cricket for 6 years. 
     I found out recently that I wasn’t accepted to my main major or even my second choice (Mechanical Eng.), and to be completely honest I don’t know what to do. I have always dreamed of attending UT Austin and becoming an engineer but now I’m pretty lost and don’t know where to go with myself. I am debating going to UT as an undeclared major or another major and transferring into engineering as quickly as I can, but I have heard that can be risky and usually doesn’t happen. 
     I just don’t know where to go or where to look for answers/guidance. I am hugely disappointed and I wish that I could know where I went lacking in my application. It sucks knowing that I am not seen as good enough for something I have worked hard towards for a couple years."
Worried about my lonely widowed mother.,"My mother was widowed 5 years ago and lives alone in a small town on the other side of the country. My brother lives in the same town - on the same street even - but has little to do with her as he is quite self-centred and only associates with high status people, which my mother is not. I live where I do for medical reasons, there is a treatment here for my condition that is not available elsewhere in the country.

I try to visit her regularly and invite her to my city to visit me, which she sometimes accepts. I took all of August to go home and spend with her, she came to my city for a week in November, which I also took off work, and I took another week off over Christmas to to see her again. She pays for my travel to come see her as it's very far and very expensive, so travel costs are not an issue. 

But I cannot keep taking time off work. Luckily my job is unconventional and therefore more flexible, and my boss is very understanding, but I feel like I'm starting to push it. I'm finally in my 30s getting into a career path that I love, after many years of small jobs (so I could spend the summer back home to be with family). 

She does not seem to understand this - though i have explained it multiple times - and keeps making plans for ""us"" to go travelling to India, the Bahamas, etc, which I then have to tell her I can't go on. She says i can quit my job. She used to travel a lot with my father and now she has no one, and it's so sad. She also will only travel to resorts and by cruise, which I detest (but that's an aside). 

Very much a First World Problem and I feel stupid even writing it out. But yesterday she just sent me yet another invitation for a week long trip in February - I had to tell her *again* that I cannot just take random weeks off and go. She is disappointed and hurt. I don't know what to say.

She's in her 70s and I'm afraid I will look back on this time with regret for not spending more time with her. But at what point can I make plans for what I want for my life?"
I'm largely miserable living in Chicago.,"It's been a day of randomers on Twitter sending me vulgar, racist tweets (I'm a white man) and people on the bus in Chicago violently threatening me. I have no one to talk to. People say 'talk about your problems', but that's an over simplification at best, you need to be careful who you tell your problems to, people can use it against you or offer their unsolicited terrible advice, and because I have no one to talk to, I am writing to you dear reader.

Like any place, if you have lots of money, Chicago is probably a fine place to live, but if not, the level of abuse, threats, inconsiderate behaviour & rudeness you face on a daily bases as you live in the poorer areas of the city is something I never anticipated when I emigrated here from Europe.

How was your day?"
Feeling helpless at the fact that I never seem to be able to catch up.,"I'm always on the verge of catching up on bills and payments but something always seems to happen right as I'm about to not have to worry. Getting my hopes up and having them crushed every single month is so stressful and I'm getting to the point of not being able to handle it. The worst part is that it's not like I'm behind by an extreme amount, if I had $800 everything would be caught up and I wouldn't ever have to stress. That small amount pays for the medical bill I have, a ticket that I was unable to dispute due to it being hours away from where I live, and water/electric that got backed up which are getting ready to be disconnected. $800 is such a small amount of money to most people, hell phones cost more than that, and it is so unobtainable for me. Paying the ticket is a must, if that's not paid by the 1st of the year then my license is suspended which is another several hundred. I work outside so it's a weather permitting job. I refused to stay home last week because I need the money and now have pneumonia. Weather is bad again this week but now that I have an added medical bill I can't not work. Everything hurts and I'm ready to stop throwing up/not being able to eat from stress (plus side on that is I'm saving money on food lol)."
I tried to save a man and I couldn't. And now I just drove my girlfriend away.,"2 days ago, long story short about the man, I tried to provide medical aid to someone who was critically injured by another person. I have trained a lot of medical stuff but I'm no field surgeon. He was unconscious and bleeding heavily. I controlled as much of the bleeding as I could, my partners and I gave CPR, worked the guy for 10 minutes. He ended up getting a pulse and he actually woke up; and after learning he later died on the table, the image of him looking into our eyes, scared as fuck, is just really fucking me up. I didn't know him. But I thought we saved him. We were fist bumping like ""fuck yeah dude he's gonna make it""

&#x200B;

So, my girlfriend of 8 months and I have been having issues. I struggle with anxiety. She struggles with confrontation. Communication is difficult between us. So anyway, the night after the guy passed I just tried to talk to my homies and handle it. Last night I really wanted to talk to my girlfriend. I tried to stop by her work (this is normal for me, when we both work I usually bring her a letter with a quote that is meaningful and just writing to her that I love her. I wrote one last night too about getting through the hard times basically) anyways, apparently I just missed her leaving. 

&#x200B;

So I called her twice and got no answer. My lunch break was now over so I texted her what happened and that I just want to see her. She called a while later but I had to go back to work, but I told her I needed her. She knows I get off at 1am so she said call when I'm off. I did. No answer. So I went by her house, she wasn't home. I tried to call again, no answer. By this time I'm nearly having a mental break down. I guess I expected her to be waiting for me when I got off, and seeing she was out and about made me feel really fucking insignificant. But maybe I shouldn't project those expectations on her?

&#x200B;

So I text her "" I need to talk right now. This cannot wait until tomorrow. I need to talk right now.""

&#x200B;

She replied "" I can't do this. Sorry. You don't get to dictate when we have to do things. You need more than I can give. You deserve someone who is on the same wave length as you, that's not me.""

&#x200B;

I'm not by any means perfect in this relationship. But I try EVERY SINGLE DAY to do better about the anxiety and such. Literally EVERY DAY I read articles, talk to my friends, etc etc. But after that guy losing his life after I tried to help him, I just wanted to hold my loved one. 

&#x200B;

I just don't know what to make of it all. I'm not going to beg her to be there anymore. But, it hurts. I'm fucked up and now I'm alone.

"I got mixed feelings about abortion, but ...","What's happening in the USA right now is beyond ridiculous.

A doctor going to jail for many many more years  than a rapist? Something is wrong with the world."
I don't know how to function anymore and I leave all my relationships in shambles and irreparable. (warning: very long and gross),"I don't know how to talk about this without talking about my history. 

I was raised by a single mother, my grandmother at times, and 2 different stepfathers. 

My mom had me at 21, too young to embrace her youth. She still embraced it, while she was raising me. She'd pawn me off to her mom or friends when she went out to get drunk or go to a show. I get that, though. How could I not? She doesn't even know who my father is and I'm sure she shamed herself for that and dealt with depression. 

But raising a kid by herself was too much and ended up with this man, Michael Totzke (I don't mind to say his name, because he's dead now, so no harm no foul). He beat me. He would ""bathe"" with me and fondled my testicles. He would beat my mom and beat me in an almost Animal crossing-esque way(gcn original). He would go onto to his character made to beat me, then 5 minutes later get onto his character account that made him beat my mom and not allowing her to go to work. Repeat for 6 years of my life. 

Honestly, my proudest moment other than hopping my first train was when he was beating her one day, kicking her face against our Omaha, NE apartment door, I snuck out the window of my room (which was one of those underground apartment rooms, so the window of my room was met with ground outside), crawled to find a big enough stick to fight back, went back in my room, strapped on a bicycle helmet, and opened my door. 

I let out a war cry in order to fight this man with a tree branch and I ran at him while he was begging my mom not to leave him after he already gave her a dozen bootfuls.

He snagged the stick out of my hand, broke it, and threw me across the room and continued to beat the shit out of me once again. I didn't care, because it took the physical pain off of my mother. 

After a few years of all that, my mom didn't want me around Mike and sent me up to Alaska where her mom, my grandmother, recently moved to so I didn't have to be around all that. I lived there for a year and it was great. But eventually I went back because I had sisters. Half-sisters. Half-my mom, half-Mike. 

I went back and in one year, this man gained like, 200 lbs. He must've weighed close to 500 the night in the year of 2001 that I woke up to the sounds of my mother's screams when she discovered him dead in their bed. Cops and ambulance came. I saw him for a splitsecond. Ghost white. Heart failure, apparently. I sat with my sisters on the couch, them grieving for their father despite being too young to really ""get"" death and unbeknownst to the horrific sins of their legitimately schizophrenic father, while I silently sighed in relief. The evil man was gone. 

So we all moved to Alaska after my grandmother visited us a day or two after Mike passed. She was a great mom, she knew her daughter and grandkids needed her. 

The pain never went away of course and kind of mutated. I have a healthy distrust in men in general and whenever my 2nd step-dad, who has his issues as well, showed any kind of resemblance to Mike, I shut him down when I was a teenager. No man should even approach my mother ever again, I thought. 

I am a giant music/game nerd because I found escapism and solace in the internet, and my life was solely based in escapism. Not from the world, but from my life and how many times I was told that I ""look like a cow"" when I eat from Mike. 

My teenage years consisted of typical poor millennial teen stuff, but with lots of daddy issues, black metal and crust punk. 

I found love online and went to NYC after I dropped out and got my GED when I was 17. I had a secure friend group at the time in Fairbanks, AK. There were 4 of us, all angry kids. Hell, half of us were bastards so we bonded about that. We were the metalheads/punk kids attending the classes we loved but drank underneath the stairs next to the gymnasium during classes we had no care for. But they knew I left them for a chance at love. 

Now, back to NYC. Some people have ""long distance gone wrong when we met"" stories, but I do not. I was staying at a hotel there for 2 weeks. She knocked on my door at 6 in the morning the morning I arrived. I was sleeping, jetlagged, groggy, and overwhelmed by being in *the* major city of the US and I opened the door. We made out for 10 minutes. We got kicked out of Barnes and Noble for public fondling. We went to a Darkbuster show that night (poppunky Boston oi/ska band if you don't know them) and some guy came up to us, said ""hey ladies;) how is your night going?"" without realizing I was a dude at first and I think he wanted a threesome when he thought I was a young woman. 

Either way, 3 months later I decided to move to NYC from Fairbanks, AK. Because I found something. 

She was not my first love, but the first one that reciprocated. First I lost my virginity to. I actually lost close to 100 lbs as a freshman when I first met her on the message boards we regulared at the time. I was tired of being fat, and in order to impress this beautiful princess (my teenage mind thinking that), now's a good time as any to get into shape. That was back when I still had fire in my soul, of course. 

We broke up a year and a half later. She once lost the 600 dollar engagement ring I bought her in the bathroom of a pizza place we had sex in, and didn't realize until we were out of the restaurant. She ran back and it was already gone. Not anything to deal with the breakup, just thought you guys should know. 

We just broke up because my insecurity knows no depths. And we still had lives to live. 

So after that, I hung out in NYC for a bit, homeless and punx as fuck, and then a few months later after different activist activities, I decided to travel. Hop some trains. Lots of trains. 

For close to 9 years, on and off. Met many people that I love. Lost even more to drugs and booze. It became my identity and my personality as much as video games and music did. Which, gotta say, the video game stuff put off some hobo kids, gotta say. I was still a nerd. A dirty nerd but a nerd. 

As I said before, I started drinking at a young age. 14/15. Not all the time, just with friends. But after that breakup, at 18/19, I started drinking hard. Started at a fifth a day, then a halfgal a day, then a halfgal and a 20 pack of natty ice a day. It wasn't until I was 20 that I first had physical withdrawal symptoms. Then by 21, it was just routine. I decided that booze was me and me was booze and it had to be that way. Tethering that line between functional and sloppy is a rope too thin for me to cross, however. 

Apparently alcoholism runs hard in my family, by the way. My grandma lost her brother and her father to alcoholism at young ages. *shrug* we're all statistics, it's okay. 

So, as I said before, my life has always been about escapism and idealism and a bleeding heart for people as a whole. 

So I continued to escape via trains, travel, games, books, drinking, acid, shrooms, h, coke, sex, short romantic relationships etc for many years. But my only addictions have been benzos and drinking. Benzo addiction was shortlived while the booze stays strong. Cigs, too. 

Because I don't know how to cope. The healthiest way I ever coped was when I tried to beat up my samuel hayden of a stepfather with a stick. 

I have had jobs, off and on. Usually shortlived. I had dreams that fade in and out. Never really knowing if I even cared about existing in obtuse capitalism. I lost a good chunk of those jobs to my drinking and depression, it's true. Just the nature of the beast. 

Here's one thing that a junior sleuth could probably tell from this post and my emotional and mental problems that exude from it, I fall in love very easily. I let myself do that. Unlike my teenage years, I was way more successful at attempting those relationships in my 20s. Either purely sexual or romantic, however destructive. 

I tend to befriend exes after the breakups. All but 2, I believe. Not really on purpose, but in recognition of the great aspects of those people that I fell in love with in the first place. They deserve happiness. And of course with that mindset there is always that small part in the brain that's like (dude, sucks you couldn't give them the happiness they deserve, you gigantic scum. Also you have tiny man titties, stretch marks, and you don't understand advanced math as much as you want to because your genes are bad and you will always remain a mediocre musician and you will never beat bloodborne and...).

So I feel like I owe them something. And because of my own issues, I always end up making mistakes *with* my exes after the relationship was already ended years ago! 

Also, when I spent some time in Cambridge, Mass, I brought 4 people onto their first train. It was great times but years later, all but 1 died to the culture I showed to them. The culture they loved. Culture of the lost. 

I once fell for a woman in Michigan who was friends with a woman that I was deeply in love with. So check this, I loved a woman from there, and we finally, after years of loving this woman in a non-stalker way because that's not me and I don't condone that weird creepy ""love"", we finally kissed. And it was great. She seemed to enjoy it as well but she knew falling for me as well, would bring down her life because I am a ""DELINQUENT"". So without my knowledge she hooked me up with a friend of hers who also just got out of a breakup. She was fierce and strong but sadly ignorant to how hippies are on the westcoast. She really wanted to go out west because she wanted to see what ""freelove"" actually is. 
 
I did not want to tell her that, in hippiedom in weed, california, that polyamory is ran by people who just want to fuck. Trust me, these people aren't artists at making love. No one really is. They just like that enigma because it gets them more notches on their belt and/or bedpost. 

But no, she also wanted to see the pacific ocean for her first time. So no, I don't think I can destroy that dream for her. 

We did our roadtrip out west (while stopping at different beautiful national parks cuz her daddy was rich and paid for a parks card) and it was intense. We loved, we fought, we fucked. 

After our 2 months of trimming weed in hayfork, CA, she said we should open our relationship, which I knew she was going to say eventually. She even said it during our relationship, but then continued to treat us as a single unit. 

As we were going back east after we both had significant money in our pockets, in Reno, I told her, drunkenly, that I didn't want to go back with her because I had no place to go because of said weird nebulous breakup. 

She fought to have me go with her but there I stayed in that hotel room in Reno. For two weeks. 

I spent thousands on booze and questionable cocaine and hired an escort who stole 600 bucks from me. At that time, I felt peaked and didn't care what happened to me. There was quite literally a shady gun store across the street from the hotel and I was prepared to end it. Because my baggage was not worth it to anyone and the fucking airport won't take it. 

I told my mom goodbye, because she deserved to know. Sadly, I called her from my hotel phone and she managed to trace it to send cops to my location. 

They arrested me, while I was like, three half gals and half an 8ball into it, and was sent to a psycheward there. I withdrawed hard. I puked so much I busted the bags they have specifically made for puking several times. They kept me there without consent. 

Renova is the name, BTW. 

Three days later, they let me back to my hotel room without compensation for the room I stayed and paid for in that hotel. 

They acted like they saved me but did they really?

Fast forward to early last year. I was in the northeast, traveling around Rhode Island, Mass, Delaware. Cold windy winter. A woman with horrible horrible teeth but amazing everything else I fell in love with in Pennsylvania had to let me go because again, of my lifestyle. She gave me a spider necklace and sent me on my way. Cue whitesnake's here I go again. I was dealing with bad withdrawals, my progress in travel was slow, and I was close to freezing to death multiple times because I could barely exist. My grandma, same one I've been talking a lot about in this shitty little story of mine, called me one day and offered to send me to Alaska so I could get better and she could take of me. I finally gave in after 3 weeks of those calls. 

So I'm back in Alaska. I called an old friend to say hi and she admitted she was in love with me since we were 21. Since then she and I have been dating. Earlier this year she got pregnant and we agreed on an abortion because we are not in ripe situations to have a kid. We both come from poor families and abusive fathers. That is the shit that churns you up and spits you out into this horrific existence that no kid deserves. 

We agreed, but she made her own decision when she saw her first ultrasound. She was going to keep it, she told me. I raged because again, I don't know how to cope. Left that night like a giant piece of snowflake dung because the kid deserved better. 

Baby was miscarried two weeks later. And now me and the mom are together again, but everything emotional seems broken. Sex and intent is all we are now. No actual actions or romance anymore. 

I know this was a long read, I'm practicing because I think I want to write a memoir in my future just because everyone says I should and it invites dark comedy stylings which I feel like I'm okay at. I love this sub so much, it's meant a lot to me through the years. 

But every instance of romantic sensibility I have breaks apart because I tend to especially fall for people who are similar. Broken pasts, broken lives. We can't change our pasts and we all have to remember that otherwise we are going to die and be another stat. 

I just don't know how to deal with any of that. Counseling, meds, friends, nothing has helped. I hurt the people I love because of who I am. 

That's what's bothering me."
Took a dog to the emergency clinic and got a condescending lecture from the vet,"Long story short: My husband and I just drove 8 hours to take custody of his parents dogs. We just learned that they have been being neglected over the last several months as his parents are in a nursing home and the person who was supposed to care for them was not.    
    
We got here and one of the dogs, a 13-year-old miniature schnauzer, is unrecognizable as a dog due to severe matting. He is basically just one big dreadloc. One of his eyes is completely matted over along with both ears. So, being a vet tech, I said we should take him to the vet.    
    
Its Saturday and the only place open was a urgent care facility. It was an hour away as they live in a small country town.    
We wait to see the doctor and explain the situation, telling her we need to document everything excessively for the police report we're filing. Ask her what she recommends we do as an emergency today and what can wait.    
    
She said that this has been going on for months so we didn't need to bring him to an urgent care vet. She said she wasn't going to spend time taking pictures of our dog when there were real emergencies like dying dogs and car accidents to deal with.    
    
I was surprised by this as I never asked her to take any pictures or take time away from other dogs! We waited our turn without complaint and were very polite and honest with her.    
    
I just feel so humiliated now. After she left the room I burst into tears. I wasnt trying to be an annoying client. I just wanted to help this dog.    
    
     
I know I'm sensitive but I'm so distraught.    "
"Friend committed suicide, hurts so much","It's been over 8 months now. Already. I can't believe it. 
He was a close friend to me, I didn't know him very long but he got so close and important to me like no one ever did before and after in this short time. In a few months we talked so much, I knew how he felt, and I knew he was up to it. He tried it once and I only found out afterwards. We talked a lot after that and he somehow found hope again and wanted to change something in his life, so we looked for a therapist and he got other medication. Some months followed where we spent a lot of time and were texting everyday for hours. After some time he started to draw back, talked less. I knew what this meant and was so scared. But I always got me a promise, like 'see you tomorrow/next week"". We were texting in our group chat this evening, we planned to go to a movie at the end of the week. after a while he wouldn't answer anymore but was online all night. I read through our whole chat history that night but didn't text him cause I thought he'd be already annoyed by me. Next day I heard, he's dead. 

It was a fucked up time back then, my boyfriend was his best friend also. He is not much of a talk about emotions person, so we had our problems while coping with that in different ways. Our friend was from another country and had no one here, so I cleaned his apartment and sent his stuff back home to his family. 
It's been some months now. Sometimes life is okay. Sometime (especially when I drink, like now) it's bad. I miss him so much. Everyday. All the other people/friends seem to go on. I feel strange when it still hits me so hard while the others don't cry or freak out about it. I have two other friends who fight with depression for years and are suicidal every now and then, too. I sometimes feel so helpless. I wish he was still here.
Sorry for the long text. Was somehow important to sum it all up."
Still thinking about you,"Every single day. Sure, some days are worse than others, but even if it's for just a moment, not a day has passed. I miss you and I hope you're doing well. I'm doing great, don't get me wrong, but your presence is and will always be sorely missed. I don't think I'll ever hear from you again and I accept that, but it still makes me sad."
You know what sucks? (Xpost r/suicidewatch),I can't kill myself. I could never do that to the people who care about me. I don't want to be alive. I don't want to continue to have to fight through my life trying to find whatever the fuck it is that I'm looking for. I want to just not be here. Either that or I want to be a heroin junkie. Then at least I'd have purpose. Do whatever I have to to secure my next fix. Then maybe one day I would overdose and finally be done with this shit. But no. I can't do either of those things. I have parents who love me to death. How devastated would they be if I killed myself or got addicted to drugs? They would be crushed. I couldn't do that to them. Better me be in pain than them. My friends too. I have two close friends and an amazing girlfriend. They would also be crushed if I ceased to exist. I can't do that to them. Either I hurt or people I love hurt. I guess it just has to be me.
"I am broke, jobless, carless, and now...I'm probably going to go hungry for the next few months.","I was very slowly getting back on my feet. I've made plans to get rid of my car and put whatever I got toward something super cheap but also not a piece of crap. I've been making 5-10 applications a day, 5 days a week looking for a new job. I was approved for EBT benefits and I had an employment training class to go to today. I planned everything out as best I could. 30 minute walk to the bus stop, 20 minute ride downtown, then another 24-25 minutes to walk to the office I needed to be at. I showed up at the bus stop *on time*, only to be informed by a nice gentleman in the parking lot beside it that the bus got there 15 minutes ago and had left. Now, I know the route that this bus takes, which means that the only way I would have gotten to it would have been to have precognitive abilities and known that it'd be there 15 minutes ahead of schedule. 

What does this mean? This means I lose my EBT benefits, automatically. There's no rescheduling this class, or showing up late, or anything like that. I'm fucking screwed. My boyfriend is stretching himself thin just covering my third of the rent for a couple of months while I struggle to find any sort of job. We have some food in the kitchen but it'll all be gone in a month. So unless I can call up to the office and confirm that my new student status means I don't need the class (unlikely), or I magically get a job in the next few weeks...I'm starving. My roommate will be fine, as he rarely eats at home anyway. But my boyfriend and I will probably have to take up hunting squirrels and fishing in creeks until I figure something out. 

Yay."
My wife left me after 5 years and I don't know how to let go.,"5 years ago I met a woman that I thought was the love of my life. A person who accepted me for me, made me feel comfortable in situations I had never been able to before and filled me with purpose.  She made me feel like we were true partners in life.  Everything I have done in the past 5 years was with her in mind. I included her in every decision I made. I sacrificed to help build a life with her and prepare for our future.

I knew something was wrong weeks before but I only realize this looking back. On January 6th I got home from work and she said we needed to talk. She then told me our marriage was over. She said that she didn’t love me anymore. That she felt trapped and had to move on. I feel that every “I love you” she ever said to me was a lie. I had never felt the way I did that day; confused, angry – furious even, and unbearably sad. I am not the kind of man that gets emotional about many things but I cried for days. I am still crying sometimes when little things trigger a random memory.

I gave everything I had and put it into my marriage. I promised myself that my marriage was not going to be a failure. That love was what we had between us and that would hold us together because we were honest with each other. I never thought I would ever be alone again.  My feelings float between rage to hate to terrified and alone.  I hate her for breaking my heart and destroying the trust I had built up in her – complete unquestioning trust. I still love her at the same time too. 

We don’t hate each other; she says she hates having to hurt me but that she needs to do this. I just feel sick to my stomach.

What am I supposed to do? I just can’t turn off a switch and move on with my life. I tried to finish our separation agreement paperwork yesterday and it didn’t go so well, just more crying and anger. 

My friends are trying to help me through this as much as they can, making sure I get out of the house now and then. Actually they insist I go do things with them. Which can be annoying but I know they are right. I have great friends. But even they can’t fill that hole of intimacy that my marriage had. Not sex, but real intimacy.  My (now) ex-wife and I found out she was going to have trouble having kids, I was by her side every step of the way and encouraged her as best I could. Of course it is a good thing we never did have kids giving how things turned out. My point is my whole life I have never been the one curled up on someone else’s lap wanting to be made to feel better. I was always the strong one. Now, when all I want is that connection of real trust and intimacy it’s gone. Almost like she robbed me of that too, taking away the only person I thought I would ever need - that would be there that one time when I was weak and alone needed someone to hold me for once – and she just left.

In her words “I thought I wanted family life, a home and all that stable stuff but I can’t stand it and I have to get out”.  She told me she had cheated on me too and I was so afraid of her leaving my life I almost didn’t care.

She came back for a month around the end of February through half of March. We went to counselling (which she hated) and I suggested a physiatrist instead. She said fine, anything that you think would help.  The physiatrist told her she was bipolar.  At first I thought, “Yes! Now we know what the problem may be and I can help her get through it!” 

It is amazing what we can get ourselves to believe so we can smile again.  

As anyone who has had to deal with mental health issues knows, finding the right medication (if needed) and dosage takes time. I would have done anything to find that magic pill that would have made her smile again – a real smile, but would it have been real? I know she loved me once but the more I think about it maybe she was just with me because she thought that is what she was supposed to do?  The mind can make us do strange things.  

So even with this new revelation, her mental health issues that is, she left for good. 

It almost killed me.

I thought about killing myself. I thought about quitting my job and just walking away from everything. I thought about lots of things. None of them made me feel better; they just made me realize I would be doing the same thing she was doing to me. Ripping myself out of other people’s lives that acre about me to suite my own purposes. Then they would feel the same as I do now. Like some fucked up version of the circle of life, circle of misery maybe?

I think she knows exactly how much she means to me. She knew I had made her the focus of my life and that was why she had to go. She had told me that she knew she was always going to have these feelings of wanting to “escape” and that she did not want to cheat on me again but probably couldn’t keep that promise either. That is why she left I think. Maybe what last little bit of herself that cared about me cared enough to leave before she really did destroy me.  

I feel stupid for having trusted someone that much.  Having brought someone into my life like that. I told her things about me that I wouldn’t tell anyone. I feel like a fool for having thought that someone could have loved me enough to decide to share their life with me.  

I have never been this low in my life. I loved her with all my heart and she didn’t really love me.  I feel like a failure that is just another divorce statistic, another stupid couple that failed.  And now I am alone and I can’t remember how to be happy being alone.  Now I am in my mid 30’s and have to start all over again. I have no idea how.

Thanks for listening.

A video of my close friend went viral and she's getting so much hate.,"A good friend of mine recently got drunk and made a mistake, she is an awesome person when she's sober but give her a few drinks and she gets out of control. A video of her recently went viral and reading the harsh comments and speculations about her mental health is driving me nuts. She does need help but on top of this extremely embarrassing video going viral in such a short time and losing her job because of it I cant help but feel bad. All parties involved got so much hate. You see videos on the internet and just automatically thing the bad guy depicted in the video is just the bad guy but I know this girl so personally that I can only imagine how horrible she feels after the incident."

High-functioning autistic in special needs school (long),"As the title says, I'm a high functioning teenager with mild autism going to a special needs school. I'm here to just complain about my average day.

Now, I live in the Twin Cities, and the school has students from the entire Twin Cities area. My bus only has two other students on it, and the really annoying one we'll call B. I'm the first one who gets picked up on the bus, and so when we get to B's house, we have to wait about ten minutes for him to come out, about half the time screaming and complaining about how early he has to get up. Then, once he calms down, he has a one-sided conversation with nobody in particular about stuff like X-Men, Batman, and Transformers. It's a long 30 minutes to school.

Once we get to school, we go our seperate ways. Unfortunately, my class is right next to B's, so sometimes I can hear him screaming about random stuff. each class has about 6 kids and 3 teachers in it, since there's a 2:1 ratio for student-teacher interaction due to the mental problems. So, the really annoying kids in my class are:  

A: A spoiled, self-centered brat who thinks anything a teacher says is directed towards him, so during lectures, you'll keep hearing him say ""Mm-hmm"", ""Yeah"", and ""Oh"". He also does this thing where any jokes he makes are in an incredibly annoying voice that cannot accurately be described in words. Also, whenever he gets into a fight (which happens a lot, even with almost no provocation), he jumps onto somebody's back and tries to gouge out their eyes, and if he can't do that, he rips the person's skin off with his nails. I know this because he's attacked me twice (thank god he never succeeded in blinding me).  

G: An unpredictable kid with a very bad short term memory and attention skills. Not much to complain about since he sleeps most of the time.  

M: He's okay this year, but last school year there was another really annoying student in the class that they seperated this year because of how bad he made M act. The staff is considering sending him back to mainstream school.  

J: The kind of guy who makes you want to stuff steel wool into your ears to make the pain stop. He never enunciates his words, so it all sounds like one long barely understandable word. Whenever there's a conversation going on nearby him, he feels the need to jump in at random points. He tries to correct people so often that I'd say he should be an editor if so much of what he said weren't true and he knew how to use a dictionary. He weighs about 350 pounds, and he tries to come up with lame excuses whenever somebody tries to get him to exercise in gym. If somebody tries to get him to do schoolwork when he doesn't want to, he freaks out and throws everything around him to random places. He's the main source of my stress.

Thanks for taking the time to read my complaining, because I've been wanting to vent for years, and I only just found this subreddit."
How can I accept that my GF likes to party..,"So i'll try to keep this short, i'm not the guy that likes to go out and party every week. But so does my girlfriend (not every week), and everytime she's out drinking i'm worried she'll drink too much and do something stupid with another guy. 

Now this makes me feel bad everytime she goes out and i even have a hard time just hearing about when she tells me about the parties. I have always been worried for these silly reasons but i honestly dont know how to stop worry..

Is there anyone who feels the same or can help me anyhow? I cant help how i feel but deep down i should not worry.. Hope my English was good enough, thank you guys."
My mother is a conniving twat.,"This has been bothering me for some time now. My mother has become this conniving little twat. It all started two years ago. Before that, she was as normal and lazy as could be, but no where as bad. Two years ago she changed. Don't know if its a midlife crisis, or menopause or what, but she changed. She started going online to chat rooms, looking up porn sites, trying to be funny about it.. Then she started going out and getting herself toys (I only know because I accidentally tripped over one she didn't put away.. gross), getting herself EXPENSIVE lingerie (She hasn't had a job in 8 years and she lives off my special 8 yr old nephews social security, which that money he never sees) and THEN, she starts going out of town with her friend ""Brenda"", gets a cell phone, starts texting people (she doesn't have any friends. None that I know of in the last 15 years) and finally, she started cheating on my dad with this guy steve ( which I actually went to school with his son).. and this is all driving me insane..

I love my dad to death. We don't know what the hell to do. He can't divorce her because she told him she would take EVERYTHING he's ever worked for and bring up stuff that happened 15 years ago between him and my sister. He's scared of her, yet he still also loves her. She moved out of our house 2 months ago (her shit is still her btw) and lives 2 houses away from us. She hassles us for rent money (when she doesn't even fucking live here anymore, PLUS she's still getting my nephews social security). 

Now, she works where i'm working, acts fake to me at work, then at home, she'll stop by and threaten all of us to take us to court and such. I can't stand her anymore. I don't know what made her snap, but i'm done with her. She thinks she's going to come to my wedding, but no. Unless she changes her act and does better, she wont be coming. I can't stand this bitch.

"My parents took $8,000 from me.","I'll try to keep this a little brief.

I'm a sophomore in college. My grandma on my dad's side gave my 2 younger sisters and myself $8,000 each in trust funds when we were very young.

Last year, I commuted between campus and my parents house. Because of this, I agreed with my parents that using *some* of that money, and not *all* of that money for a car would be the best option.

I felt like saving money in that fund for emergencies like rising tuition or car problems/insurance was a great idea, and it would give me a cushion if I needed it.

My father took all $8,000 and bought a truck, without consulting me. I never drove that truck when I was home, in fact I was banned from it. Instead I drove the family Crown Vic.

Now I'm an RA on campus. In order to continue to pay for tuition here (it's a private school) I have to keep another off campus job. This new job is about 15 minutes or so away. 

Tomorrow is my first day at this job. I wasn't able to find a ride with our on campus shuttle to get there, so I decided to call home and ask for a ride. I felt that was logical, because my sister was available for said ride, and wanted to give it to me. So I set up plans with her for that

My mother called me on the phone, was very angry that I would ""have such guts"" to ask for a ride to my job when I should be able to find rides. ""It wasn't in our agreement""

I was also told by my father that our shuttle service runs *until* noon on weekends. It in fact *doesn't* run before noon.

What would you suggest I'd do in this situation?


Longer than I thought, but 
**TL;DR My parents took $8000 to buy a car I never drove, now I don't even have any car and I'm still short a lot of money for college**"

Omegle friend,"So i met this person on Omegle and we got along real well. at first we were messing with each other then we gradually started to get to know each other. we talked for at least 3 hours having fun making each other laugh. Im not sure if its just me but i could tell we were becoming friends. we told each other our names im pretty sure we became as good as friends as 2 people over the internet can get. we started to get tired and as i ask them if they were tired and they started typing, first it was 1 minute, the 3, then 5 then 20. and it still said stranger is typing. i waited forever and then i came to terms with it. they probably lagged out or something since the said they were using a phone. Tori you were a good friend for the time i knew you i just wished we could of kept intact. i know its just someone i met over the internet it shouldn't be that big of a deal but it is to me she was really funny and nice person.

"My girlfriend has a lot of guy friends, and I feel uncomfortable for some reason","First of all, I just want to say that I know it's wrong to say that she shouldn't have any guy friends. Also, this isn't what I'm saying. I'm just saying I don't like the way she talks to all her guy friends so regularly. 

Basically, she has a ton of guy friends. Like, a ton. And I don't know any of them. They're all either from her work or from her old schools. She texts them a lot, really regularly. As well, her female friends text these guys from her phone. So one of her friends might use the phone to hit on the guys, without the guys realizing it's someone else. That's worded kind of confusingly - basically, a friend will text a guy using my girlfriend's phone. The friend will call the guy 'sexy' or something, without telling the guy it isn't my girlfriend. So the guy will think my girlfriend is calling him sexy. 

Also, I feel uncomfortable with her talking to all these guys because they're either her exes, or at some point have had a crush on her. Each one has confessed their attraction to her, and she's turned them down. That hasn't stopped her talking to them, though, and they're accidentally being led on by her friends. I just really wish she wouldn't talk to them quite like that. Another thing is, when talking to her friends about them, she'll call them sexy and hot. Like, right while I'm there. It doesn't really help my self esteem. 

I'd love some advice on how to change my opinion on this. I don't want to make her stop being friends with anyone, I just wish I didn't feel so uncomfortable with this. Thanks in advance.

Also, as a sidenote, her lesbian friend makes advances on her all the time. They both joke about it, but I don't really like how this girl can do inappropriate things and pass it off as a joke. Plus, she totally hates my guts. Like, she will give me a death stare any time my girlfriend isn't looking."
I'm afraid I'll never grow out of my imagination,"Now don't get me wrong, I know imagination is a great thing and can inspire people creatively, but mine is rampant and honestly depresses me sometimes. 

I constantly daydream about exciting things. Superheroes, zombies, knights, and all kinds of random shit. It's not just the occasional thought though, at all times I have a sort of 'story' going in my head. Usually when I get bored of the story I scrap it and move onto another one. They can last for a day or even a few weeks. It would be a great source for writing, however it's usually never original and often directly inspired by things. I think about these 'stories' almost too much. I purposefully make time before I try to go to sleep to 'progress' them more. Now while the idea may sound silly, that doesn't really bother me. It's my weird mind and I don't care what other people think about it. The thing that bothers me is that usually at some point I start to get mildly depressed about the fact that our world is boring compared to the awesome, supernatural things I imagine. The mild depression usually fades and I forget about it. The depression never lasts long but sometimes it can be really strong for a little bit. By little bit I mean no more than 5 minutes.

Another part of this issue is that my brain likes to 'latch' onto things and people. An example: I recently watched Harry Potter so I've had a 'story' going on in my head for a while based loosely off the universe. A worse example is that my brain chooses to latch onto people. There was a girl in my history class a few years ago who became part of these 'stories' without me really thinking about it. While the stories changed she was always part of them for a while. It bothered me because while she was attractive, it wasn't like I had some huge crush on her, I had never talked to her and I really didn't know anything about her. It was just creepy. She had even started to show up in my dreams. So I forced myself not to think about her. Eventually the thoughts went away.

I don't know what goes on in the minds of other people, but mine scares me if I give it too much thought.

---

While I'm getting things off my chest I just wanted to mention one thing that has really been bothering me, and I know at this point I probably sound like a mental nutcase.

Another issue I've been having very occasionally is the idea that my dreams may predict the future. It's not consistent, and it's never important. It's always just really mundane things like a person calling me that day, or a conversation. I thought for a while that my mind was somehow manipulating myself to believe I had dreamed those things (kind of like how Deja Vu works?), but recently I distinctly remember a dream where my friend called me to ask me to get lunch, a friend that I had just recently become friends with and had never talked to on the phone with. I remember waking up, thinking about the dream for a few minutes, then I heard my phone ring. As I reached for the phone I said their name out loud jokingly, but then it was them, asking me to go to lunch. I know that this all of this is most likely coincidence or my mind playing tricks on me, but I just had to get it off my chest because it has really been bugging me.

Anyways I'm almost 19 now and I am just worried that maybe I'm kind of crazy. I don't know what I'm looking for. Maybe a medical term, a person who can relate, I don't know. Just typing this out makes me feel a lot better."
A recovering bulimic with the urge to purge.,"I've been doing okay with my recovery and haven't purged in about 5 months but the eating disordered thoughts are continuing to get stronger and stronger. Family drama insued and I was told I can't have an eating disorder, it's just a bad diet that I'm not good at.My meal plan was chucked out the window after that conversation, and for the past two weeks, I've been skipping more meals and wondering when I'll get my next 'fix'. That long run, the skipped meal because I am too busy to eat, and starting yesterday, when can I throw up? I could use some more support, and don't know which way to turn. Thanks for letting me vent. Advice is welcome."
I Owe So Much Money,"So, I'm a soon to be sophomore in college and I wasn't ready for the real world. 

My family has sucked me dry financially, I owe my previous bank $430, my credit it suffering because I've maxed out my only credit card last school year and I have no money to even make the monthly payments.

All of my refund checks were spent helping my family with food and bills. Between books and my family, I had no money to myself. Hardly any to even wash my clothes, buy body wash, or even toothpaste. I had to go begging my friends like a hobo... 

I owe AT&T almost $300 because my brother wanted some internet in the house and I was the only person with good enough credit to get it. While I was away in school, noone kept up with the payments and even though my brother claimed to have discontinued the service, they kept charging me. All of the letters from AT&T were just shoved into some drawer, unopened! 

Somebody drove my car and got me a ticket! The price keeps going up every month and no one seems to want to pay it. I won't even be able to go to court if I get summoned seeing as that my school is 18 hours away... 

I'm freaking out over how I'm going to find a job. I have too many school related expenses and I can't rely on a relative to help because they all have their own financial troubles.

My car is another situation in itself... I think I'm just going to make another post about it. 

I feel so weak and useless and stupid and taken advantage of and WEAK. This is only half of my troubles and I wish I was strong enough to get through this."
I attempted suicide today.,"And I feel I'll do it again shortly, the only thing stopping me today was that I was interrupted by an unexpected phonecall from someone who cares, but very little has changed about my situation.  
I'm twenty-two with two serious mental disorders, one is constantly stigmatized and portrayed everywhere as something dangerous and so I feel ashamed and scared to talk about it lest I hurt future employment opportunities, and the other only doctors accept is real, the public doesn't.  When you have an illness that affects every aspect of your personal life from who your friends can be, to your diet, when you can leave the house, what do you tell someone who asks about your employment when you know they'll brush you off as a lazy, incompetent youth who needs to suck it up?  What if I try and then am fired, over and over again for things not my fault, how would that look on employment records?  

Also I said something extremely rude indirectly to a friend and someone I deeply respect recently while I was intoxicated for a medication I'm on, and hearing how much it upset them today put me in so much shame that I couldn't bear it, and it was just a final straw to a very large pile that's been growing on me for a long time.  I feel even further shame that I almost killed myself without apologizing to them for being so rude, and still wouldn't hesitate to do so now.  I imagine I'll send them a suitable apology soon, god I hope they forgive me and that I haven't hurt them permanently.  Why was I such an idiot, I should have just turned the computer off after taking my pills.  And then I dragged someone into my own idiocy by accident, I'm sorry friend.  It was all my fault and I hope they aren't upset with you

The funny thing is, the incident that started my final step today?  Taking these fucking pills that turn my filters and smart functioning part of my brain off. I'm typing this all after having just taken one and so this will send me further into shit like these always do.  I hate them but I need them right now or I'm going to die... I just wish they would make my unconscious functioning brain not such a fucking asshole."
No idea what to think anymore...,"My wife left me, it didn't bother me as much as everyone expected it to, as Id known it was coming for nearly 2 years.

On the side of that I had realised that I wasn't straight, I knew I was Bi at a young age, however the last I'd say 6 or 7 years I've slowly realised I'm not interested in women in any way sexually, the act of laying with my wife was something that took alot of effort on my part and I had to resort to viagra and porn to get myself ""ready"" so to speak.

Anyway, I found a guy about 5 or 6 weeks ago, really good looking, exactly my type, tattoos, great taste in music (liked alot of what I like) and seemed the whole package.

Now first 3 or 4 weeks, it was great, we spent alot of time together, got on really well, didn't wanna be apart, barely stopped speaking. Felt such a strong connection to the guy I was scared in all honesty, I'd not expected to find that so fast.

Outside of the little honeymoon bubble we were in, my life however carried on. I've been battling my ex wife for access to my kids, I've not seen them in months now. There was ALOT of slander and bad mouthing about me, alot of snidey comments and posts about me, but I just ignored it.

However it got to a point at the start of the week were I was unable to continue the happy place and I had a break down cause everything got too much and I felt like I was drowning with it all.

I barely spoke to the guy that day, mainly because I was busy talking to lawyers and the council and trying to make sure my life doesn't grind to a full stop.

The guy couldn't handle that apparently, and got really really pissy with me. He then became exceedingly narcissistic when I tried to talk to him about it all in the evening. Everything had to be about him, I'd tried to explain to him that I'd broken down and had a ridiculously hard day, that I didn't know how to carry on and I wanted him with me more than ever. Yet all he could do was kick off and tell me his problems were worse.

He then started with the ""I don't wanna be hear tomorrow"" bullshit, telling me he was going to hurt himself etc etc. After the day I'd had I couldn't handle it, I told him I couldn't help as I was broken myself and trying to get my head into a place where I could help him was impossible.

He went absolutely mental at me, called me a lot of crude things, then switched to begging me to talk to him, then crudities again, then told me he loved me (we've known each other 6 weeks....)

I couldn't cope with it and selfishly I turned my phone off and just went to bed.

The next day, I tried to speak to him to sort it out and whatever, but it all got pinned on me. Every last thing got pinned on me and I was painted as the bad guy.

I, like an idiot, pushed it to one side and invited him round for a couple days, thinking we could sort it out and smoothe everything over whilst he was here etc.

Within minutes of him turning up he was throwing shade at me, having the little jabs and comments were coming in full force.

I bit my tongue and carried on thinking it'd pass, but for the last 3 days all he's done is constantly remind me it's my fault etc and when he left today I was so happy to see him go.

My conundrum now is, I genuinely feel quite strongly for this guy, but then at the same time I'm not here to have someone belittle me and make me feel like shit after years of having that from my ex wife.

I don't know what to do, and honestly I don't know why I'm posting this, I just wanted to get it off my chest I think, I don't think anyone can help me here, but I just I dunno.

Sorry for the wall of text."
"It goes up again, but I hate being alone.","This year was a total mess so far. Lost my job and my girlfriend both at the same time and my parents didn't have the best reactions to make me feel much better.

However things went better lately, got a new job and can probably work on this Friday, since the weather will be good again here.

Nevertheless I really miss the time I was in a relationship. It's not my ex, I am quite happy it's over, since she meant more harm than love, without me realising it until we broke up.
I miss hugs. I miss sex. I miss kisses.
I know, deep down in my heart that someday I will find the women of my dreams, and hopefully be happy with her. But I feel like the older I get (weird to say this at 20yo) the more I am missing out, when it comes to love.

I'm really not a guy that likes to go to parties and all that and I will definetly not change that. Still... I kind of want this loneliness to end somehow. Not be alone."
Trouble with a friend,"I had someone I considered a close friend and coworker, for almost a year. After a while I developed feelings and tried to bury them and did a relatively good job, but I’m not sure if my judgement is skewed because of it. 

She’s called me her best friend, which I’m okay with just being friends, but has put me down by saying my pain doesn’t matter. She made an excel spreadsheet to prove that I didn’t care about her. It was extremely hard to handle that, given I had tried so hard to be there for her. Eventually, one day I told her she’s my best friend to which she said I’m not her’s. Mind you, for absolutely no reason. 

I became emotional after that point and lashed out, calling her both a bitch as well as manipulative. I apologized after, but I’ve been getting the cold shoulder for a while now.

I don’t know if I overreacted from my feelings, or if I’m just a terrible person for saying those things to someone I genuinely care for. She’s not healthy and I understand that to a degree, but it still doesn’t stop those things from hurting tremendously. 

I wish I could just not care. I really wish I could shut my brain off."
"I'm really ambitious, but I never feel like I can follow through when I'm in a position that holds any kind of power.","I know there are bigger things going on right now, but this is what is bothering me right now.

I know the title is kind of vague, so I'll elaborate. I'm entering my last year of college in the US. Next Fall, I'm serving as section leader of my section in marching band, and I'm also the president of my fraternity. I feel obligated to say my fraternity is a service one, as I know the general opinion of collegiate greek life. We raise money to help educational programs around the area, and send money to larger programs run by our nationals. To continue, both of these are elected positions. I beat out several people for both. I am honestly so thrilled that I get to help these organizations from a better position.

But I feel like I'm not good enough. Like, I messed up today by sleeping through an online meeting with a national officer of my fraternity. I messaged and told her that I had a family emergency, and I'm just now able to reach out to her. But I still feel like a fool.  

Honestly, if I saw my resume under someone else's name, I'd assume that lady has her shit together. Like, I got on the president's list this semester even though Corona hit. And, for the most part, I'm on the Dean's or President's list every semester. I just feel like, because it's me, my accomplishments are invalid. Like I didn't earn them, and I don't deserve the trust of my peers in these organizations. I'm not perfect by any means, but I got shit done in every other position I've held in my fraternity. When an underclassman had issues in the band, it was often me that gave them information they needed or just lent a helping hand instead of the section leader at the time.

Logically, I know I'm capable, and I can do these jobs. But I really don't feel like I can, and I get stuck overthinking every little thing. I don't know how to bridge that gap between my thoughts and my feelings."
"I have bed bugs and I feel so embarrassed and filthy, I want to cry (x-posted)","I’ve never in my life had any sort of pest infestation in my house. Now I have bed bugs. I am so upset and embarrassed. I always take care of my house and clean it. The only way I can think of that I got them is my ex brought them to my house. His brother had a bug infestation months and months ago, probably last summer. He went to the house a few times to help treat it. I didn’t think I had bugs in my house because it was so long ago that that happened. Then Saturday I found dead bed bugs on my bed skirt. 

I honestly want to cry. I feel so dirty and embarrassed and like I’m going to be judged. I had to take off work today because I have Orkin coming here to do an inspection and I’ve got to wash all my blankets and clothes and such. My boss texted me asking if I can ask Orkin if my office should do anything too and like I get why she asked but it also made me feel like shit. I’ve had to have had them for awhile since I’ve had a constant break out on one arm (I didn’t think it was insect bites because it was only one arm and bed bugs are usually all over) since November. If I had brought them to the office they would have already been there by now. Back in November I had my bed checked for bed bugs and there was no sign of them. I think they’re in my box spring. I’ve been sleeping naked to see if I get bites anywhere else and it’s always on my one arm. I don’t sleep on my side to where that arm is visible all night I know I don’t. So it didn’t make sense to me that I would have bugs. I thought I had an allergy. Especially cause I’d get hives at work that I didn’t wake up with that morning.

I’m open to suggestions on how to treat them, I’ve got some ideas of my own I’ve already started too. Basically I covered my box spring in diatomaceous earth and the bed posts have diatomaceous earth around them. I’ve been washing all my blankets and such since yesterday. I’m going to throw all my clothes in the dryer since heat kills them. After I speak to Orkin I plan on steaming my mattress and box spring. I’ve already vacuumed my room but will vacuum again, including my mattress. I have a bug bomb to set off. If Orkin suggests buying a new mattress and box spring I will. I have zip up mattress and box spring covers coming through amazon. 

I think the bugs are only in my room since my roommate isn’t being effected. He has no bites whatsoever. Just me. So I don’t think the common areas like the living room or his room have any (I’m in the basement, then there’s a middle floor with the living room dining room and kitchen, and the floor above that is where my roommates room is).

I will be so glad whenever this is over. I’m so fucking upset. 

My town every spring has an ant issue too. They get in everyone’s house. It’s about that time when they’re gonna show up (I’ve already seen a few) and them on top of these bed bugs just have made my already embarrassed and gross feeling worse. 

Thanks for taking the time to read if you did.

I am open to PM’s however I am busy cleaning today so I may not get back to them right away. I’m fine with just answering comments in this post as well.


Update:  Orkin came out. He inspected my room only before immediately saying the entire house should be done. I was told over the phone they do treatments in the effected rooms, the technician said they do no such thing they only do entire house treatment. The cost for my house would be about $2k, that doesn’t include the cost of replacing my mattress box spring and bed frame which he also suggested I do. 

I asked him to check the rest of the house because I wanted to know how far the infestation has gone. He checked my roommates bed and said it looked fine. He didn’t check the couch and such. I’m pretty hesitant to go with Orkin because for one the inspection wasn’t as thorough as I would’ve liked especially again when the person I spoke to on the phone said they’d do an entire house inspection regardless of what is going on. The other reason is I honestly can’t afford $2k plus a new mattress and stuff all at once. I just can’t. I know Orkin does payment plans but for reasons too long to explain in this already nightmarishly long post, that’s not an option for me currently.

I asked the Orkin inspector if there was anything I could do here to help with this process (mainly what should I do with my clothes and would using a steamer on my mattress and box spring until I can get replacements be beneficial) and he basically said he couldn’t say because all of that is anecdotal.

So I have another company coming out Wednesday for a second opinion. I’m hoping they also conclude it’s only my bedroom and can treat just my room. I completely understand the risk involved there of only doing one room."
I'm in a friendship that I know is toxic but I'm struggling to get out.,"So this is a story that has taken place over almost ten years so I'll keep it short and include only the most important parts. I'm wanting to make sure I'm in the right and maybe seek some advice from others who have been in similar situations.

When I was 17, I started my first real job working at a local store. Being in a small town, many of the younger people working there also went to my high school so I kind of knew some of them but had never really interacted much as I had always been a quiet kid who mostly kept to my own small group of other kids like me (non-rebellious, introverted, anti-alcohol). I don't know why I was like that. I came from a family that was totally cool with partying and normal teenage antics as long as we stayed safe, but I think because I was also a gay kid who had not yet come to terms, I isolated myself from regular circles because I didn't allow myself to be "" the real me"".

When I made my first friend at the store, I was introduced to people who finally made me feel comfortable with myself and within a year I was taking part in the bigger circles, had started drinking socially, and in general felt like life was more fun. This friend and I became very close over the next few months and soon we were calling each other ""best friends"". This is when I started to notice red flags.

I won't get into everything but it started as little control things. She would make me and our other mutual friend in a circle of three feel like it was a problem if we brought anyone else into the group, but when she wanted to hang out with other people it was fine. If we did anything outside of our little circle without her, she would make it clear (passive-aggressively) that she didn't like it. When she went off to college, she would be annoyed if we talked about anything we did while she wasn't there as if we were supposed to wait for her to come home before continuing our lives. It was some time in here that I started to feel anxiety whenever I would get a text from her. This anxiety continues to this day.  We would occasionally get into a fight over something ridiculous that should never have been a fight in the first place. Stuff that I just didn't see as a problem -and no reasonable adult would think it was- but she did. If our other friend was dating someone (I didn't date in the small town because I had no options), she would act like her friendship should still take precedence over the relationship. She was always number one and had to control everything. If something good happened to me, I knew she would only be happy if it didn't mean taking me away from her (or out of her vice-grip). I was constantly walking on eggshells. 

We both kept our jobs at the store and would come back between school and other jobs we were doing on the side. Eventually after going to school for a year (I was 21 at the time), I decided to come back to the store and start working my way up and developing a career at the company (let's not go into whether this was a good idea or not. I've just always been lost in terms of what to do with my life so I ended up taking the option that was in front of me). Eventually I moved out of state and took a management position at a store in the city. I would go home and we would hang out sometimes and it felt like the distance was a good thing for me. I no longer felt so controlled. 

The first summer, she and another mutual friend (our old bff had moved on and we had balanced the creepy little private friend group with a third member) came to stay with me for a few days so they could go to a festival that I wasn't interested in. When I left them alone in my house, she snooped through my bedroom closet and found some private things (don't ask lol). Needless to say, I was not happy to find this out later when she made fun of me for it. *She would later go on to retell this story without me present to people I would never share with*. I italicize here to emphasize the severity of this breach of trust in my eyes. I am a very private person and, frankly, I don't think it's unfair to see someone's bedroom *and especially their closet* as off limits when visiting. When confronted about it, she brushed it off and made it seem like I was overreacting and it was funny.

I eventually moved on to a new store in the same city and soon found out that she had decided to come back and move up as well despite having finished a degree. At this point, I was having work related anxiety and had closed myself off and hadn't spoken to her in a few months. I thought I had finally cut the cord and I could let the friendship die. That's when I found out that she was coming to work at the same store as me. This was not planned as she didn't know I was working there. I just about puked. We reconciled our friendship because we both thought it would be awkward to work together and have this rift between us. 

Almost ten years after the beginning, I'm now 26 and still entangled with this person I can't seem to get rid of. She still tells the private stories I have shared with her even after asking her not to. I no longer share anything with her outside of work talk because I know it will come back to haunt me. I never text her first because I keep hoping she'll take the hint but she never will. She still tries to control me and makes me feel guilty for any social activity that doesn't include her. I now try to hide the evidence if I even hang out with other friends. It's a feeling of anxiety that overtakes any fun I might be able to have. I feel like this is high school stuff that has continued into my adult life and I just want it to end, but because we work in the same building in equal positions, I am terrified to cause problems. I am trying to move on to another job but with this COVID-19 epidemic, it may not be for a while. We are essential workers and I have really strong job security at the moment and make decent money.

As I write this, I'm feeling unnecessarily stressed out because days ago she had said she wants to hang out tonight. I don't want her to text me because I know even if I say no, she will pressure me and make me feel guilty. I just don't want the confrontation and if I say no to her, she always makes my feel guilty.  I know if I go over there (and yes I know we should be distancing because of the virus - she doesn't care because we work together anyway), we will spend all night talking about how to fix my problems and she will tell me what's best for me and eventually I will agree just to shut her up even though I actually don't. *I feel that I am at a weak point in my life right now and I would rather be a recluse than have friends who don't make me feel good about myself.*

I'm just done feeling anxious and I want to be free to move on to new social circles and start rebuilding my life. I feel like friends shouldn't cause anxiety and when just a simple text gives you a sense of dread, it's time to cut the cord. I just feel like every time i find the scissors, she finds a way to get them out of my hands before I can.

So much for short lol. It's mostly a vent post, but if anyone has been in a similar situation, please feel free to chime in. I know I'm not the only one dealing with toxic friendships, but it's hard not to feel alone when you're in one. Thanks for reading!

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm in a toxic friendship and am struggling to get out of it. Basically the title."
I’m so fucking afraid,"My dad is sick rn. My grandma is sick too. 
Normally I would not really care since they have weak immune system but because of the whole pandemic I am concerned now. I know mortality rate among those who are old and weak is much higher than for the rest. Both my dad and grandma fall in the category of old and weak. I’m so afraid. 
Healthcare in my country sucks. Until a few days ago they were hiding that there are people with virus and now there 30+ cases just in 3 days. And I know that a lot of people don’t go to the doctor. I know that a lot of people don’t care about quarantine. I know that a lot of people didn’t give a fuck to all the warnings about washing hands and not touching faces. And because of them there is a chance that my dad and grandma might have caught virus. They self quarantined themselves but they didn’t go to see doctors since their symptoms are not exactly the same as the ones that are usually listed. 
But still I’m really scared. I’m abroad now and I’m going to fly back to them in 3 days. I will also isolate myself from them in case that I actually carry the virus.


But I’m still afraid that something bad will happen."
$60 short. Coworker pissed at me seriously wanna kms.,I recently started a new job and I was closing. I seriously fucked up. I was $60 short and he’s pissed at me (he was opening). He told me not to come into work today and that he would cover my closing. He quickly delete the messages (I saw them pop up on my phone before they were deleted) and then he said he’d close with me today. After he said he wasn’t going to stay.  We work in this particular section of the store and he has the lead position and  my schedule and stuff. I’m so dumb I seriously hate myself. Someone wants to speak to me when I go in today. I’m a super anxious person and I’m scared to in. Hate myself so much.
I am having an increasingly harder time connecting to my peers,"This is my first reddit post so bear with me. I was wondering, if any of you have found that connecting to your peers has become a chore. I am not an anti-social person I actually have tons of friends and generally get along with everyone. I go to the bar with my friends, I listen (and sometimes enjoy) the trendy music and I don't have any pressing issues in the department of sex. I'm no sexual behemoth, but I'm not abstinent by any means.

I just don't understand why every time I go out, I find myself closer and closer to wishing extinction. Now before you get on my case, this isn't my manifesto, I want the worst for my species but I don't wish to pursue this myself. In fact, quite the opposite, which is why I am here today. I feel more and more distant from the people around me, and it's beginning to tax me. Going out on the weekends is starting to drain me, going on dates is the worst, and even in my classes in college, while I enjoy the presence of some of my professors I find myself only socializing so I'm not viewed as the weird kid in the back.

Now, it is impossible when dumping thoughts onto a message board  to not ramble a little bit so I apologize. With that being said, let me clear a few things up. I'm not an alpha nor am I a beta, I'm not a chad and I sure as fuck am no Elliot Roger. I just feel like an anomaly. I don't feel like I am some ascended being looking down on peasants, I consider myself intelligent but am very good at acknowledging the intelligence in my peers as well. I am not envious of much and I don't hold any hatred for anybody. I just feel as though I view the world differently. Not in an arrogant way, but in a humbling way. I think the human race has exploited their time on this world and, for the most part, has squandered their gifts in every way possible.

When I say I acknowledge the intelligence of my peers, I feel as though everyone is smart in their own way. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. My natural strengths have always been with reading people and exploiting that to influence them (exploit is a strong word but I don't use this for nefarious purposes). The issue is going out has started draining me so much that I no longer use my natural strengths to benefit me. I simply don't care enough. Which saddens me, one of my favorite hobbies is reading people as I speak with them, Silently and free of judgement of course. Lately, that urge just doesn't strike me, I go out speak to people, wish I could go home the whole time, and then leave. Which worries me. Am I becoming so distant from people that I'm losing the ability to relate to them?

So, this brings me to my conclusion and the finality of my question/statement. Are there like minded individuals out there who share these issues with me? I could go on for pages but I do not wish to put you all to sleep any longer with my rambling. I simply wanted to paint the picture of what my life was generally like and see if i could reach others that think like this.

To those that share this view or some aspects of it:

How do you cope with it? Should I continue to play along? Should I seek new friends? Does it get better? Worse? What information can you offer me, or if just want to talk about this with me so perhaps we could draw some conclusions together, all is welcome. Thanks to anyone who can help. Or if you just want to call me a weirdo POS that's cool to, I'm not easily offended!"
A simple statement. A day ruined.,"20M, sophomore in college.

I was just about to leave my physics lecture. The instructor talks about being safe since a lot of people seem to be getting sick. She says “stop kissing each other”. That’s all it took to throw me down a pit of depression and sadness. The people around me can relate with that statement, because being intimate while in college is normal. Relationships are normal. Not for me. I don’t have any experience with love and it ruins me. I’m not fucking kissing anyone. Never have. I’ve never done anything. Nearly all the people around me do though. I feel left behind. I feel unworthy. I feel like shite. My post history has more info if anyone cares. I’m sorry."
I am far more unhappy then I should be.,"I understand that my life is pretty good by most metrics. I get accepted to my goal medical school last year, I graduated a semester early, I’m not ugly and I have a decent body. I have a good amount of friends that I hang out with multiple times a week. However, I don’t feel excited about anything anymore. I realized this about a week ago. All the things I usually loved doing like reading, playing music and playing video games are now boring so I just sleep and scroll on my phone in my bed. My parents are basically immigrants who lived much harder lives than I could ever imagine so they can’t understand why I am unhappy, when I can’t even explain why myself. Now that the semester is starting for my friends and I’m home, I feel even worse. I used to be the funny kid in class that always had a smile on his face and making others laugh during tough times, but now I can’t even go an entire day without being extremely pessimistic. When I try to talk about this to someone I feel pathetic because my life is good compared to others. Even accomplishing goals don’t give me any sense of satisfaction or accomplishment. When I got into med school I wasn’t even happy. Just meh. I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Hopefully someone here can give me some perspective and help me find some meaning in this meaningless life."
I think my fiancée is going to leave,"I met her last June and we started dating a couple days later. We hit it off very quickly and had great chemistry. A month after we started dating, her boss who she was close with, killed himself. She’s never totally recovered from that. Then this year we got engaged at our 1 year anniversary. Since then it’s been a run of just hard things. Her brother was limiting her contact with her nieces, which the oldest was like a younger sister. That was a hard patch and then last month they moved 700 miles away and she likely won’t get to see them. The oldest doesn’t turn 18 for 3 more years. I’ve tried to be there for everything and I’m not perfect. I also started a new job this year and I don’t like it. It was a mistake. 

It all came to a head yesterday. I know I can lose my cool and acting like a child I hit my fridge. Broken hand. Which of course is a trigger for her past and now has her unsure of our future. I just don’t want to think about what may happen in the next couple of days"
I'm so bad at my job.,"I'm in high school and working at a well-known fast food place for over 2 months and I suck ass. I'm slow at everything and I have the fucking skillset of someone whos been working there for like barely 2 weeks. All the new people who started after me surpassed me quickly and got decent at the job within a month. I can tell the other workers are getting slightly annoyed as well and I don't blame them. The managers are all nice for the most part and train me, I'm just ass."
I really hate my life.,I'm tired of this shit. I can't believe that I'm 27 years and I'm the way I am. I'm still stuck on a dead end job and can't figure out what I like to do for a stable career. I still live at my grandmothers place and still haven't gotten my shit straight to get on with my life. Im literally a fucking loser. I hate that I put myself in this situation. I have no social life or no friends so in order to keep myself busy I have no choice but to go to my moms house where she acts narcissistic. I feel like I stuck myself like this because I'm afraid to put myself out there and break away from this comfort zone I'm in. I've always been afraid to get too involved with other people and I isolate myself. I don't know why I'm like this. It's now taking a toll on me and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm just tired of this lifestyle and it's only causing more stress. I still can't even choose a career. I'm tired of feeling like I can't financially support myself if I move out. I'm just a empty human being. I don't even know what my problem is and why I'm doing this to myself.
I could honestly cry.,"I made the decision recently that it's time to stop pretending that my mental health is fine and that my once weekly visits to the counselor who spends half of our sessions on his phone googling things I tell him because he's ""curious"" are sufficient to maintain my functionality. I found a small handful of psychiatrists in the area who take my insurance, a list of phone numbers were provided to me by my health insurance provider. My experiences with said psychiatrists were as follows:

pdoc #1: made ""the wrong kind of appointment"" through his call center service for my first appointment, after I'd taken the day off of work, and sent me home after charging me a $20 copay that his secretary ""didn't know how to"" refund, telling me that they could make the ""right"" kind of new patient appointment for me to see him - 7 months from now.

pdoc #2: was able to see me in a month and a half from my calling him, and when I showed up and mentioned that I've been worried about money he launched into a half-hour tirade about how Donald Trump was an American hero and snowflakes were all too blind to understand his genius.

pdoc #3: called office after being referred by health insurance. Turns out he's DEAD and has been for like 6 years.

pdoc #4: not accepting new patients, despite being listed on my insurance provider directory as accepting new patients.

pdoc #5: not accepting new patients, despite being listed on my insurance provider directory as accepting new patients.

pdoc #6: not accepting new patients, despite being listed on my insurance provider directory as accepting new patients.

pdoc #7: ""patched through"" by the behavioral health facility she supposedly works for. Ended up connected to the personal cell phone of a strange man who picked up and started screaming and swearing at me before hanging up.

I don't know what to do anymore, it's clearly time to give up on finding a psychiatrist but the prospect of feeling this way forever is hideous."
I just worked a 14 hour day and I desperately wish I had someone to come home and cuddle,"My job has me outside so as bundled up as I was I eventually started freezing. I miss the times when I could come home and crawl into bed and just hold someone, or be held. I had that with my ex who I dated for 5 years. I miss that, not her. It's a very lonely feeling."
My wife has cheated on me multiple times.,"The first time things started out in a gray area between her and the other person, so I was of course more than ready to accept that things just got a little out of hand and that we were both to blame for that, that it was a learning experience, ...really anything which would prevent me from feeling 100% like a weak, shitty, undesirable pushover. I discovered what was going on in this instance when I found a stash of love letters from our roommate.

She was suicidal at the time and in the psych ward when I discovered the love letters, so after she begged me to stay with her, I figured that leaving her at that time would be something akin to failing her out of university, or sentencing her to death, as she had no one else in her life who 1) was nearby, and 2) had the presence of mind to keep a close eye on her to make sure she was safe. 



I also had selfish reasons for staying with her, the main ones being that I don't want to be alone again and believe I will be alone for a long time, and possibly forever, if I leave her.


&nbsp;


The second and third times happened almost simultaneously; she asked me to log into her skype account so that I could communicate with our roommate about something because her phone was dead (I guess maybe she wasn't thinking about what else I might find there). I scroll up a bit in their conversation and discover that she had been communicating explicitly with her ex. I also learn that she had brought someone home from her university campus and nearly had sex with him; they were both naked and the only reason it didn't happen was because he finished himself off, had second thoughts and left.


My discovery of this evidence triggered a suicide attempt on her part, and I had to cry and beg hysterically over the phone for her to come back to me and not kill herself. 


&nbsp;


It's been about 4 months since the last incident, and I can't stop thinking about her with these other people, wondering if I can actually trust her about anything at all. I also can't stop thinking about divorce, but my biggest concern would be that to divorce her would be to kill her, as she would fall apart like in the past and commit suicide. 


&nbsp;


I think the worst part about all of this is that I'm no longer the protagonist of my own story; I'm not the one making things *happen* in my life anymore, I'm just an observer--someone to whom things happen. And it seems like things can never get too bad for me, because I have no breaking point; I'll just keep bending and giving up territory, inch by inch, looking for any little excuse to rationalize staying in a shitty situation.



Growing up I never imagined I would ever feel so weak, humiliated, impotent, and ashamed, but here I am today, tolerating an intolerable situation because I'm afraid."
Lost my job and didn't get my dream job.,"In August I lost my job, what made it even better is I lost it right between my birthday and my wedding day.

I have always loved technology and repairing computers. I found out recently there is a company in town that repairs PCs, sells them, and sets up/does maintenance on networks. This right here has always been my dream job. 

About 2 weeks ago I had an interview. The owner seemed to like me and said he wanted to run the ad for 2 more weeks to see what he gets. So, being the diligent person I am I wait the two weeks and email them for an update.

He gets back to me saying he has considered all sorts of things but hasn't really made a final decision yet. I just email him and say that's fine I understand and that I'll get in touch with him at a later date.

Later that evening I get an email from him saying that he wants me to have lunch with one of his associates on Friday(today). This gets me excited as I also noticed that the ad had been taken down. 

I meet up with the manager for lunch and we have a conversation. Everything seems to be going well and he says they'll be in touch. About two hours after that I send a thank you email to both the owner and the manager. Soon after that I get an email stating while they liked me, they decided that they weren't going to hire me at this time.

It has just devastated me. It seemed like I was getting all of these signs that everything was going to work out only to be shot down. Sorry to ramble on a bit and if you did take the time to read this thank you. I hope your day has been better than mine.

**TL;DR Lost job at inconvenient time. Interviewed several times for a company I really want to work for but didn't get the job.**"
My cat just died.,"Hey, just bummed and wanted to tell somebody about my cat. Don't really know what to say other than she was the fucking coolest. She was a shop cat. She lived at my dads shop where i spent most of my time after school and stuff and since five years ago have been working there full time. So i see her almost every day. We got her fourteen years ago when one of the employees dropped her off and we knew instantly we'd keep her forever. I was 10. She was just so chill. Never bit or scratched, you could just pick her up and hold her however you wanted and shed just cuddle up against you. Lately i've been the one opening up the shop. Every morning she'd meet me by the front and chase me back to the shop.  I'd hold her at lunch everyday, it was the best way to stop her from trying to steal your food. It got bad probably two weeks ago. She was completely fine until one day she came in and was just really out of it.  Super lethargic and dazed looking. When we took her to the vet they told us she had pretty bad kidney failure. Which isn't uncommon in cats i was told. They kept her for a bit and gave us new food to put her on. She wouldn't eat it. She had been so used to people giving her junk foods and treats and stuff. She had everyone in that shop wrapped around her little paw. She refused to eat the new healthy stuff. The weight just fell off. She was just skin and bones instantly. She had been off and on the last week or so. Some days she was a little more lively and some days she hardly stood up. Today she couldn't breathe. It sounded like she couldnt catch her breath. Ragged and short. We knew it was time. We took her in and petted her while they put her down.  We buried her at the shop, in a patch of grass she liked to lay in.  The worst part is,  more or less, we killed her. Her whole life we gave her cheap hard dry food. It just destroyed her kidneys. She was only 14 which is a decent age but she deserved much more time. All it would have taken was nicer food. Im sorry milly. I love you."
I feel like I'm going to single the rest of my life....,"I have been single for seven years, and I am a single mom and I feel like I'm never going to find the one, and that I will be alone forever...its on my mind constantly its now started making me depressed....that's what's bothering me"
Picture a cup in the middle of the sea,"I sit here with the realization that theoretically I have everything.. no, **more**, than I could ever want or need. A wife, family, job, money, safe home, cars, electronics, gadgets, so on and so forth.

Yet I feel I have nothing at all.

Day in & day out I'm surrounded by people, yet I feel like I'm trapped in a bubble. The world buzzes by & I'm not fully able to plug in, connect.

I'm just here. My life is passing by & as I reflect on it, it all seems so meaningless. I'm nothing more than a crude bit of matter who once never existed & who will someday never exist again. All of the accomplishments & possessions I've acquired will be both forgotten & meaningless 100 years from now. I'm sure my great-grandfather had one hell of a life, but I know nothing about it. Someday someone could say the same thing about me.

I've tried to find happiness, but it is so god damn elusive. Honorable things like charity & good works. Not so honorable things like drugs & women. Nothing provides clarity. Nothing provides any true meaning.

Therapy & meds have been of no help to me. Meditation is impossible. My mind is always racing, trying to figure it all out. I'm not sure what the fuck I'm doing here. Why are any of us here? This is all such a big fucking mystery & I'm getting tired of trying to figure it out.

So I'll just sit here, as I always do, and continue to let the world pass."
My family is imploding.,"My mum and dad have had problems for a long time, at least 10 years. My dad drinks too much.

But recently things seemed to be ok. Dad still drinks too much, they argue on and off but nothing major. 

They've been doing the kitchen up recently. Mum decided she wants it open plan. So dad took down the kitchen wall. Argued a bit about it, but it came down.

Then he's realised he'll have to sort the ceiling. There's been a leak for a while. So today my dad had the day off work. He decided just to pull the ceiling down.

Mum came in from work and freaked out, understandably, about the giant hole in the ceiling and the bits of ceiling all over the floor. She yelled a bit, grabbed her car keys and left with my sister.

They came back about half an hour ago, and it's been constant argument ever since. Which is ok, I can deal with that. And then I heard a crash. Thought maybe the rest of the ceiling had just come down too.

And then I heard my mum screaming ""what the fuck are you doing? Are you trying to break that too?"" Yeah, he threw something at her. Followed by lots of mumbling from dad, and then another loud bump and then my mum yelling ""don't you dare punch me"" and the sound of a slap. This happened a couple more times, and then my sister's run downstairs crying and screaming to join in the fun.

Edit: my sister shouted at my dad to get out, because no one wants him here. My mum told him to go, but not to take the car or she'll call the police and report him for dangerous driving. My dad doesn't seem to understand what's up with everyone. My sister is now sitting in the bath crying. I'm hungry but don't particularly want to emerge from my room."
My mum has cancer,"Just phoned up my mum for mothers day and found out she has recently been diagnosed with cancer. Luckily it's a very treatable kind, I forget the name of it right now, but she has a good chance of getting better. She's going to have to go in to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy next week. She'd prefer I didn't visit her for 2 weeks because it's going to be very intense. It is quite a lot to deal with and I felt selfish for getting upset on the phone. She is positive and dealing with it well, which is the main thing. I just have to try and be positive and look forward to when she will be better."
"I saw a picture of my first real girlfriend with an engagement ring, and it's making me feel a world of weird.","So I'd gone out with loads of people before her, but she was The One, or so I thought at the time. I lost my virginity to her last year after a good quarter century or so [don't laugh]. Well, she wanted other things, and we parted very amicably [or so it seemed] and I've tried my damn hardest to get over her [working on myself, waiting, dating other people, the works], and only giving into the vice of ""talking"" to her once in 9 months. I was tired and emotional, if you catch my drift, but the feeling never faded.

I'm with a wonderful girl right now, and I hope things work out between us [but I have a sneaking suspicion they won't]. Anyway, I was looking at wedding photos in which a mutual friend had been tagged in, and I saw her. In the background. With a ring.

Now call me juvenile, but everafter still scares me. I did miss her, yes, but the fact that you could make that promise so soon after what we had - well, it makes me think. That my current relationship is not the one. That I'm not taking relationships seriously. That maybe I'm not as emotionally mature as I thought.

I think I should go ahead and break up right now and not cause the amazing girl in my life right now any more distress. I'm just worried of hurting her, as she's been through a lot. 

I need help responding to things."
My supposedly good friend has been making out with my ex girlfriend in front of me for weeks now.,"Well, ""making out"" isn't exactly the right term...i'll get to that later.


That title may bring up a lot of questions. Let me clear them up right now:
- all three of us work in a city theatre department

- he and I have been friends ever since September of 2013 (when we began the production of another performance) We were always talking and cracking jokes at each other. We got along well. 

- her and I dated from February of last year to August of last year. We were working on a show together when we first started dating I eventually ended it on what I thought was a good foot. We agreed to stay friends. We stayed in contact some, but not much. 

My department just started another show in December. When I found out we would be working together, I got a bit paranoid at first, but then realized everything'd only be awkward if we made it awkward. So on the first day of work, we both said hi and gave each other a hug. And it turns out my buddy would also be working with me! Great, right?


Well, they began flirting. Then they started holding hands. Then they started kissing. It's very hard not to notice these things because our building is pretty small. At first I honestly tried to avoid being in their presence as much as I could. But then I got a thought...


After a bit of observation, it seemed like they were intentionally doing this when I was around them (My guess is it's her doing more than his). So now I just stand where I'd usually stand or go where I'd usually go . And it *does* seem to lighten up when I do that. I just smile and try to go about my business.


But ever since i've done that, they've slowly been going nuts on each other. I'v heard how annoyed other people are by it as well. And I can't be sure...but it's like she gives me this look every once in awhile, in between a kiss with him. A look that says , ""eat your heart out."" 


Am I jealous? You may think so from reading this, but I can honestly say that I am not- or do not think I am. I am, however, pissed and depressed beyond my wits. I thought he was my friend, and then he goes and does that with my ex girlfriend? I know she's my *ex*, but still, that's not an okay thing to do without *at least* asking if it'd bother me, right? Or am I wrong?


And then she, while knowing fully well that he's my friend, goes off and does that everyday with me right there. I can't let her know it , but it's killing me. I don't even enjoy the work i'm doing anymore. Now it's about getting through the day without breaking down. 


I haven't spoken to either of them about this, or really in general for sometime. She sometimes says hello, but all I can do is grunt, ""hey."" 
She's always been ""stuck in middle school"" if you know what I mean. She was also brought up in an EXTREMELY conservative and scarily religious family. Not that there's anything wrong with being religious... It's just that it was a bit too much for me. She wouldn't make out with me because she thought it was demoralizing. 


Now, my former-friend, he's a complete horndog. So if you think i'm worried about them having a relationship, that's not it. I'm confident that pretty soon , he'll whip his pecker out and she'll scream bloody murder and run for the hills. What's really bothering me is that they're both doing this willingly with full knowledge of our past and my being there. He's in it for the tail, and I think she's in it to get to me. I say that because, remember, she's ""stuck in middleschool."" She was always a very dramatic person. 


Guys, this is really killing me. Figuratively, of course. I think I'd like to wait until the show is over to say anything to either of them (out of professional courtesy and so it won't be awkward). But I feel like I'm going to burst any day now and fuck the entire production up. I don't want to get fired. We're only a few weeks away from opening. But it's so fucking rough every day. I don't know what to do."
I don't have a job and I miss my hamster,"I had a hamster. I love my hamster, like seriously, [he's awesome](http://i.imgur.com/eON4v4x). But my partner and I just moved into a new place and they don't allow pets so we had to send him to stay with my partners parents.

Our tenancy here only lasts til August. My fiancee has said that if I can get a new job (I'm unemployed at the moment) we can move out right away to find a place that'll let me keep my hamster. But I can't find any jobs that'll take me. I don't wanna get stuck in retail for the rest of my life but that's all I'm qualified to do and I wanna get out of this house.

There's no food in the house, we barely have money to buy more, I'm depressed, I miss my hamster and I worry that I'm gonna end up in a dead-end job if I end up in any job at all."
Sick of not having anyone to talk to,"I know my problems are probably a 1 out of 10 on the scale of significance compared to others, but I don't know anything else.

What bothers me most right now is that I can't even talk to it with anyone.  I've already discussed some of this stuff with my parents, and have visited a physician about depression and anxiety.  However, aside from my parents there is only one friend I talk with regularly, and he doesn't give a shit about this kind of stuff.  Or if he does, he will only reply with one sentence, so it gives the impression that he doesn't.  

I've spent a fair share of time trying to seek some kind of help or something on reddit and /r9k/ on 4chan, but it's bothering me that I have to resort to strangers online.

Aside from getting new friends and previously mentioned methods, is there another option from therapy to talk about this stuff?

edit:thank you to everyone for responding to this post.  I'm very glad that subreddits like this exist, and I will pay it forward"
First suicidal thought in a while,"I have got severe depression and severe anxiety, but thanks to counseling for the past few days I have been feeling almost normal. However today I had an anxiety attack over nothing and it just triggered everything off again. I got home from work and got a bottle of vodka and all the co-codimol I could find and just started writing a note. 
I realised what I was doing when I finished writing my note and now I feel worse than I did before.
It seems to be that no matter how far I get I always end up worse than before and its just starting to get too much. I don't want to end it, because then I'll be even more of a disappointment to my family, but I just want to find peace.
I'm spending the night with my brother but I still feel so alone. And that's what's bothering me :/"
A close friend of mine wants me to 'get my act together' before he dates me.,"I'm not sure if I'm being illogical, so I wanted to ask the people of /r/whatsbotheringyou for advice.

Firstly, I'm a 21 year old college senior majoring in Psych. The first 3 years of my college career went quite well- I worked in two research labs, got a grant to do my own research, joined the McNair Scholars program, started an honors thesis, and a worked towards a bunch of other academic pursuits. It was stressful, but I was lucky enough to not need to work, so I could devote all of my time to my studies.  However, I burned myself out and got depressed towards the start of my third year in college. I ended up withdrawing from 2 semesters of classes, and I watched my dreams of going straight from my B.S. to a PhD program deteriorate. I'm doing far better now, but I still have a lot to work on. 


I have to pass the quantitative section of my GRE and get my apartment in order. (My depression pretty much confined me to my room, and the rest of my apt suffered for it). I also gained about 20 pounds due to eating takeout all the time. 


I have a close friend who has expressed a bit of interest in dating me, but I'm starting to get frustrated at the conditions he's decided to place. He told me that before we start any type of relationship he 'wants to see me get my act together'. He wants me to lose the 20 pounds, get my apartment in order, get  into a Master's program, and start wearing make-up again. I feel like he should be more patient- studying for the GRE is taking up most of my day, and I don't want to get involved in so many things that I fall apart again. 

His life isn't completely together, hell, he dropped out of college. I don't expect him to change anything. Is it wrong of me to feel like he only wants to date me if I'm perfect?"
I am under an enormous amount of stress right now. I want someone who doesn't know me and who doesn't have a biased opinion to just lend a kind ear.,"Here are my first world problems that are, in fact, bothering me:

I'm a fifth year senior (at an undergraduate institution). I'm applying to law school, grad school, the peace corps, and jobs. I'm only applying to so many different things because I'm genuinely interested in all these options, and I'm not applying to more than one law school and one grad school. 

Anyways, many days I just can't manage to get anything done in terms of these long-ass, daunting applications. I don't know if subconsciously I'm intentionally putting it off, I'm just tired, or a combination of both. It's making me even more stressed because I can't manage to just get it all done.

I know this is supposed to be a process. It's not supposed to take a day or two. But, goddamnit, I miss what it felt like to just have a couple of responsibilities to worry about, instead of what feels like a thousand. 

In addition to multiple jobs and volunteering on top of my schooling, I'm also partially helping support my boyfriend through his PhD program right now, and I'm sure that adds to my stress. I love doing it because I love him, and he'd be lost without me.

I know what you're thinking--*you're complaining about the possibility of obtaining an even greater education and having a loving boyfriend? life must be tough...*--I know I'm incredibly blessed. 

You ever notice that when you are surrounded by loving people you feel even more stressed to live up to your fullest self to make those you love happy? I know, I know--these life decisions are supposed to be about me. And they are. But I still can't shake that feeling.

Thanks for listening, Reddit. Hopefully soon I'll figure at least a small part of life out."
My mother seems to care more about interior decor than my father's threats to disown me,"About 1.5 years ago, I broke up with someone out of fear of parental retribution. Afterwards, when I specifically asked about it, my dad confirmed that yes, I would be disowned if I got involved with anyone who was at all black. My mother was silent then, and every other time this argument has come up. She *says* she doesn't want to disown me, that she will not cut contact, but that it's not worth fighting with my father over. 

But, she chooses to fight my father over all sorts of stuff. She says more words about my father leaving a vacuum cleaner out or the fact that he had to pull things out to go through and organize them and decide what to throw away. The two of them argued for nearly two years on the color of a toilet. 

I just don't understand how someone can derive so much their self worth from the color of a toilet in a house they don't even live in and so little from the family's relationship with their son. Why is she willing to break down in tears over granite counter-tops, but not even say a word when my father threatens to cut contact? "
She fooled me again. My heart hurts and I really need someone to talk to...please.,"My ex and I began talking and spending time together again over the past few weeks. This whole time she has made me believe she is back in love with me and that we're on the track to dating again. This past weekend, she stayed with me. We had a fun time, and re-experienced emotions and intimacy that hadn't been explored since back when we were dating. The final night she was here, we had sex but it only lasted a few minutes before she was claiming she was too sore ""down there"" and it didn't feel good for her. I respected it, and so we got dressed and cuddled up to watch a movie. I didn't see it as a red flag at the time, because aside from the sex incident, she was very affectionate and touchy/kissy with me....telling me how much she ""loved me"" and had missed being with me. 

So the next day we both get off work and decide to go out and get sushi, then go see ""Captain Phillips""(Would recommend btw, great movie.) Everything seemed fine...we had a great conversation at dinner, then she was latched onto my arm during the movie and kissing on me and cuddling up to me. We get out of the movie kiss, say our goodbyes/iloveyous and part ways. 

Then things just stop. She quit answering my calls, texting me and essentially started ignoring me. Tonight I finally demanded that she give me an explanation and after much prying, she finally tells me this: ""to be honest, having sex with you didn't feel right at all. maybe we've fallen out of love"". WTF? She waits until now to tell me....after staying with me, cuddling, kissing, saying she loves me, and letting me pay for her dinner/movie? She essentially used me so that she could FEEL like she was in a relationship and get my affection.....She led me on. I feel fooled, tricked, mad at her, mad at myself for trusting her and letting myself fall for her again. Why would she string me along like that just to abruptly tell me she doesn't want anything between us anymore? She didn't apologize or anything. She only cares about her own feelings. I'm honestly pretty hurt right now. She fucked with my head and emotions like that and she has no remorse about it. I feel stupid and used. 

EDIT: Turns out shes been fucking some guy she used to talk to. Started the very night we went to the movies. Right afterwards. How can someone be such a shitty person....I feel even worse now. "
I'm terrified of speaking on the phone and extremely afraid of balloons.,"I just can't do it. I guess i'm most scared of dialling the wrong number (I have to check several times while the call is being connected) or not knowing what to say.

Whenever I have to call someone I don't know (e.g. making an appointment, calling customer service, calling a store to find out their hours/if they have something in stock, or anyone I don't really know), I end up staring at the phone for up to several hours trying to put it off. And when I eventually do end up dialling the number, in those long seconds of dial tone, my heart is pounding and I get really sweaty as I try to remember what I'm about to say because as soon as someone says ""My name is ________, how can I help you today?"" I will automagically forget everything I had rehearsed in my head. Hearing ""this call is being recorded for quality control purposes"" makes me even more nervous because it makes me think that they are evaluating and judging *me* even though I rationally understand it's probably the specialist being evaluated.

The same goes for leaving messages. Sometimes I think this is even worse than getting a live person because I know that whatever stupid things I say are recorded and can be listened to and replayed many times. Once I hear the beep it's time for me to go but I simply end up stammering and trying to piece together ideas that I wanted to say (probably in the wrong order, too). The worst thing is I'll hang up when I think I'm done and I won't remember what I said and what I wanted to say but forgot.

This anxiety doesn't stop at phones. I am also horribly afraid of (inflated) balloons. Just the rubber ones, not the aluminum ones. When I see a balloon I freeze up because I know it could pop at any instant without any warning. **Seeing a balloon makes me want to talk on the phone all day with complete strangers.** I have been ~~forced~~ persuaded to play ""balloon popping"" games where the objective is to pop as many as possible and I basically end up with a panic attack, and when I explain that I'm afraid of balloons nobody takes me seriously. I mean my sister has even threatened to blow up a balloon and pop it if I don't do what she says, so I am forced to comply. I wish I could get therapy for this but I don't have enough money or time (as I'm in university).

Any advice would be extremely helpful.

**Tl;dr** I'm afraid of talking on the phone with people I don't know and even more scared of balloons but nobody believes me."
Every girl I know is either pregnant or married.,"I'm only nineteen, but it's kind of disappointing that everyone in my age group is wanting to grow up so fast. It also makes it really hard to freaking date anyone. 

I know there is more fish in the sea or whatever, but i'm just talking about my city. I really have no idea why someone would want to have child at 19 or 20. "
Being Someone Else's Rock,"It's hard to say where to start here. I'd like to cover all my bases and get it out there before I explode without this post becoming a novel.

Suffice to say, I'm my boyfriend's rock. We've been together for seven years, going on eight, and I feel an immense amount of pressure because I'm his go-to when he feels bad or needs support, which is fine - it's part of being in a relationship - but it's increasingly becoming the focus of our interactions. 

He's having a hard time. He's been diagnosed with depression and was on medication for a while which helped, but since we both are working minimum wage, we can't afford the treatment any more. The doctor he was seeing suggested light therapy, but we can't afford to spend $300 on a full spectrum lamp. Our relationship has gone from long distance to living together to long distance again when my stepfather chased him out of the house. He's never had a family to speak of or help support him, and that bothers him too.

When my boyfriend moved out of my house, he had to drop out of school. He moved in with friends. After finding that living situation disagreeable, he found his own apartment. He kept saying ""I know if I can get a place of my own, I'll feel better."" I sort of knew going into it that he wouldn't - it was a ""grass is greener"" type thing, and that his depression would latch onto something else. It has. His problems now revolve around not having a car and having to ride his bike an hour and a half one way to a minimum wage job that he hates while dealing with frequent flat tires, spending his entire day at work or getting to and from it, and constantly having hints dropped by the manager about how expendable everyone who works there is. He feels stuck. He had goals for his life - things he wanted to do - but now he sometimes says he's not even sure what he wants any more. ""I'm not in control of my life."" has become something of his mantra.

We live paycheck to paycheck. I live with my mom and stepdad while I go to school, and I don't have many bills, so I don't mind giving him money, but it was incredibly intimidating for me to go from almost three grand in my savings account to $200 in about a month. I've never held more cash in my hand than I did when I gave him the money for his deposit, and his apartment is one of the cheapest we found. Since then, I've given him money on a regular basis. He probably gets about 3/4 of my paycheck any given week. Working two full time minimum wage jobs between us, we're managing to pay his rent on time and make sure he has fresh tires and tubes for his bike. I keep enough money to put gas in my car to get to school and work.

I haven't been able to see him in a few weeks, which is hard. I almost never have the time off, and a trip to see him costs me a full tank of gas. However, every time I do go see him, all we do is chores and errands because I have a car with which to do them and we can't afford to do anything else. 

I really do love him, but it seems like all that we do together is talk about how bad he feels, how worried he is about money, I send him money, and when I do get to see him I spend the day taking him to the thrift store and the grocery store and to pay bills and apply for assistance (thus far he's been eligible for a small amount of food stamps and nothing else). I've started to dread taking his phone calls because it's hard for me to listen to so much of his depression and be supportive without feeling pressure myself to help him feel better - though doing so seems something beyond my realm of capabilities. I worry constantly about money and about if he's going to hurt himself and about how bad he feels to the point that I've started having anxiety attacks at the drop of a hat, and my family is pushing me to see a doctor about anti-anxiety medication. On top of that, I feel bad that I think about how _I_ feel and the pressure _I'm_ under because he's the one in the bad situation.

I haven't been able to talk to anyone about these things. If I tell him, he'll only feel worse and panic that I'm going to break up with him (he already feels awful that I give him all my money, even though I don't care so much about that). I can't tell my family because they don't like that I send him money in the first place even though they don't know the scope of how much I support him financially. I thought it would be good to get it out _somewhere_. Hopefully the release helps."
The arts are getting the shit-end of the stick. Again.,"The Dean of Arts at my university is recommending that more than 20 arts programs be suspended. The **Dean of Arts**.  They say it's due to low enrollment. Well when you have one of the best theatre programs in all of Canada, yet restrict seats to 8-10 per year, competition and requirements tend to be high. If you're worried about numbers, open seats, allow more students to enroll and give you money that ***you keep saying that you need so desperately to continue***.  The facilities are there, we can fit well more than the numbers you allow. 

I'm saying this because my comments would probably be moderated in the comments of the article I read."
I build overly strong connections with fictional characters.,"I've had depression for most of my life, and cope with it using daydreams.   Most of my daydreams consist of characters from media rather than my own. I go on adventures and bond with these characters, all in my mind. I feel an actual emotional connection. They comfort me, have conversations, cuddle with me in bed, and (before someone else brings it up) have sexual experiences as well. What helps is that I can control their reactions, even if their personality is already established. I can play out any scenario I want to.

I don't know, I guess because I both know everything about them (from watching their character) and can ""control"" them, I feel safer with them than I do with real people. And this bothers me (oh look at that, I got to the point!) because I feel like I'm supposed to get this support from real people.

Just for fun, here are some characters I've daydreamed about in the past: Sonic the Hedgehog (lol middle school), Pokemon characters, Mario...pretty much any Nintendo character, the Ninja Turtles (especially 2k3), the Ghost Adventures Crew, Ratchet and Clank, Sly Cooper, Miyamoto Usagi, a lot of cartoon characters in my childhood...
The list goes on. No shame because of my throwaway account."
I'm scared...,"I'm scared of my country, I live in Honduras, one of the most dangerous countries in the world. I sometimes think: ""So many places in this world and I was born in this hell...  Why?"" 

The police here is not very good, crime dominates everything here, criminals have no mercy here, they go mugging elders, teens, kids, mothers, anyone... It's ridiculous, I enjoy studying, I have a thirst for knowledge, I work hard in school to get good grades, but it's ridiculous that some day I may get killed by some random criminal that needs money, all the work I have done, would be gone, simple as that. 

Crimes remain unsolved here, every day in the news you see 15+ people that were killed.

I want to love this country, the people here are great. But there are more bad people in this country than good ones. It rages me how criminals can easily get away with their crimes without facing the law. 

Every day, I get scared I might lose a loved one because of some criminal. 
I'm scared about the future of this country, I'm scared about not being able to achieve my dreams because of the high murdering rate here, I'm scared of this country... 

However, I still have hope for humanity, I know there is always good somewhere, but it just so hard to find good here. 

That is all, this was more like a rant, but I had to get it out. 

Thanks to anyone that took the time to read this."
I have literally zero motivation,"Right now, I'm in a great place if you look at it from the outside. I'm in the middle of a PhD, have a great girlfriend, no money issues and a bunch of decent friends.

Throughout May and June, I ended up working basically every waking hour to try and meet some paper deadlines, which I eventually managed to meet. I actually got accepted into the conference for one, which I was quite excited about. I then took a week of doing ""work"", but nothing to do with my PhD and just some time off it to concentrate on a project I wanted to do. 

Fast forward to now, and I've done, well, basically nothing on it for the past month. I just don't have any drive whatsoever to move on with it from here. I only currently have a vague direction of where I want to take it, which probably doesn't help, but I can't seem to be able to just sit down and think or do anything on it to progress properly. When I'm sat in front of my work, there's just no drive to actually do anything, and my mind is just cloudy as to what to do with it.

Ultimately, there's more deadlines coming up for conferences (in a month and two months), which I have nothing for at the moment, and at this rate *won't* have anything for, and at the moment, I just don't want to do it. This then leads to nothing really happening, which leads to more anxiety about the fact I've not done anything, which leads to more of a motivation slump. I'd take a holiday, but I'd feel shit doing so since I've not really got anything done for the past N weeks.

Ultimately, I feel like I'm in a good position in life, I just don't want to do this any more. Part of me wants to finish my PhD, because otherwise it's a wasted two years (which I'd also have to explain to employers...) and I *do* want to finish it, but another part of me just wants to jack it in and go and find a job somewhere instead."
Stood up 3 times in the past week. Physical pain. Emotional pain. I am starting to feel like I honestly can't do this anymore.,"I've been single for 3 years now out of a 2.5 year relationship. I've tried dating since the first year after I got out of that relationship, only to be stood up / rejected. 

I'm starting to feel like in a world where ""there are plenty fish in the sea"" I'm the one person who can't find one. 

Above and beyond that I've got (what I believe to be, but hasn't been officially diagnosed) arthritis and at 21 years of age living with my parents still.... They think I'm making excuses. Every day I stand up I get jolting pains in my hips, my legs, my elbows, fingers ... You name it and its in pain. 

I'm mentally wore out from school. I've been told before ""straight A's or get out of my fucking house"" as it's my dad who's a slave to his 12 hour a day 7 day a week 52 weeks a year job. 

I don't have anyone to vent to, and keeping all this bottled inside is really taking a toll. 

If anyone read this at all, thanks. "
I believe I'm too damaged to be in a relationship for long.,"There's a lot to say here but I'll keep it short. Many of my past relationships have been painful. I've been cheated on, manipulated, used, people have tried to change who I am, verbally abused, constantly accused of cheating when I wasn't etc. Not all of my exes have behaved like this, to be clear. On top of mental health issues and being raised in a dysfunctional household, I feel I cannot trust a romantic partner. 
  I always think they're cheating, lying, doing something harmful to me, selling me out to my enemies or trying to manipulate me. Self loathing plays a role because I cannot find out why they're even talking to me in the first place. I know logically I have many desirable traits. I'm so misanthropic I find it unrealistic to think anyone has a real interest in me, instead of just a craving for my pain. 
  I believe if I cry in front of a partner for any reason at all; if I show a fleeting moment of uncertainty or pain; if I ever need one moment of support; if I make $5 per year less than them for even one moment then they will lose all respect, love and attraction to me. I was told this is incorrect. I cannot take that chance.
  I cannot trust or feel at ease in a relationship. I've tried to remain single, however I always fall for this trap. Either I drive them away by trying to catch them before they cheat, or it ends because I see their BS coming, or I find out too late that they're terrible.
  I feel terrible regret for the ones I've wrongfully accused of these things and a deepening hatred for the ones that made me think this is just what real life is. If I truly love you, whoever the next person will be to make the mistake of being drawn to me, I'll explain in the most loving way why I never want to talk to you again: whether correct or incorrect, I'll always think you're going to harm me and laugh about it. That is no way for either of us to live."
I finally bought that book I wanted for so long.,"So I have started doing Calisthenics at the beginning of the year, but really started to train actively since March, when I lost my girlfriend and my job.

Yesterday I finally applied for a short term job, but it's something until I can (hopefully) study in October.
Knowing that I will have an income again, I bought the second edition of Overcoming Gravity. I will finally be able to train properly and it just makes me so damn happy.

I really hope it is as good as everyone says..."
My brother is always doing stuff to me that will make me upset and then keeps asking me why I get defensive!,I’m tired of him doing stuff to me and then will act like I’m not supposed to be upset about it. The moment I say something he’ll raise his voice and tell me that I’m being defensive and that I need to stop. He’s always constantly playing in my face and whenever I get upset about something he’ll try to make me seem like I’m the crazy one and will trip it to where he thinks I don’t make any sense and then he’ll act like he doesn’t understand what I’m saying. Even if I say something to him about being rude he’ll try to make it as if he wasn’t trying to be wrong and will make me look crazy for being upset. I’m also tired of him taking my emotions for a joke and using them to find reasons to mock me. Even if I get upset over that he says I’m being defensive. It’s like I’m not allow to express how I feel whenever somebody treats me badly. I don’t know why I feel like is target most of the time. I don’t know if he is doing it to try to gaslight me or not.
I need to vent about work.,"I work 2 jobs, both in healthcare. One is just a one-day a week position where I'm basically just extra help for their crew, and the doctor there is an absolute nightmare. He's rude, hostile, dismissive and cold to the point of being inappropriate with the way he speaks to his crew sometimes, and the other is my full-time position that I love. I always figured that part of the reason boss #1 was so awful was because his crew was constantly quitting on him without notice, just not showing up for work anymore, but it quickly became apparent that he was the *reason* they were doing it. One of his longest-running people, and his most reliable and dedicated, finally quit on him last week and he *didn't even say goodbye to her* as she left. She'd worked for him for years, and had always been his right hand woman.

So the other day my brother, who is epileptic, had a moderate seizure that landed him in the hospital. He is going to be released tomorrow, and if I called out of my Sunday shift at my part time job today, it would be the one day I could really stay home and take care of him. I figured 3 days is a decent notice to call out of a very short shift, especially considering that the full-time crew there literally just doesn't show up for shifts or calls out of them at the last second all the time. 

I was wrong, apparently, because when I texted boss #1 and explained the situation, his attitude was *insane.* He said, in these words, ""Well you're just going to have to figure something out then, aren't you? Unless you want to be taken off the schedule entirely, I'd better see you there on Sunday. I am now requiring a 4-week advance notice for anyone who wants to call out, and since you decided to wait until now, I'm not going to be able to allow it. The decision is yours.""

I was stunned, and I said, ""a full month's notice to call out because of a family emergency? That's a lot, especially as I'm just extra help for your crew. Is this some brand new rule that only applies to me or something?""

He responded with, ""I'm not repeating myself. Find a way to get here Sunday or be removed from our schedule. I'm sure your brother will survive for 5 hours without you.""

I was so angry and so hurt, since I didn't even HAVE to stay on with his crew after being hired to my new job, I'd only stuck around for the extra $50 a week and to help out, that I said, ""Fine, take me off the schedule then. I can't promise I'll always be able to give you a full month's notice if my epileptic brother has an emergency.""

He texted me back with a sarcastic thumbs-up emoji and a ""Bye.""

I have never in my life been spoken to like this by a supervisor, especially since I was always extremely reliable, helpful and accommodating even though he didn't deserve it. I needed to vent, thanks for letting me get this out."
"People who call you greedy, when truly its them being greedy","Just felt like I needed to get this on here.

&#x200B;

All my life I have been careful about money. This has led me into situations where Ive been called greedy. I have never avoided paying anything ive shared with people. I have never avoided my responsibilites when it comes to money.

&#x200B;

I was the only one who had a car in high school, and people expected to catch a ride with me for free. I told this one dude once, he could pay me about 25bucks per month and I could get him back and forth to school every day (20minute drive to school, 20min back, so 40mins). He refused. He also called me petty for asking this.

&#x200B;

Then there was this time I hesitantly drove a few ""friends"" to a party not to far away. Apparently in the middle of the night, they call me and say I have to pick them up, and that was to be expected when I drove them to the place. I said that we didnt agree on that, and they hung up on me, and all of them screaming greedy fucker in the background.

&#x200B;

And the last story was some one who wanted to hike along, saying they needed to go down the road to their house or something. I told them no, I dont do free stuff. Pay me and perhaps it will be ok. They then proceed to call me greedy, even though its them who wants something for free, isnt it them being greedy?

&#x200B;

All the people in the stories are different people. Are people really like this all around?"
I'm hoping I have a mental illness,"I don't want to have one. It just seems that if I have a labeable problem then I know how to act and how others should act around me. Because of this statement I have been researching a lot about mental illnesses. I get a bit depressed at winter brake, and when I'm at school, but sometimes I'm weirdly energetic for no apparent reason. I thought I have bipolar but it all seems as I don't have enough extreme simptoms for it. So that has been bothering me."
How do I make my sister feel better after she got rejected?,"My sister is really nervous in terms of partners, and after encouragement from us and our actual waiter, she gave her number to another waiter who had been flirting with her all night. And he never texted her and now she’s really crushed, and I feel awful because I encouraged her. How can I make her feel better?"
I don't know why this is bothering me so much,"So I was looking forward to a long weekend, but last week we got friday off due to a storm. Now, next monday we have normal school because of it. I don't know why, but this frustrated me so much I'm about to cry."
I got bullied about 10 years ago and I still want to beat my bully up if I get to see him.,"When I was in middle school there was this kid that first posed as my friend and then all of the sudden started being super shitty to me and my little sister who was like 10 at the time. This kid was 13 just like me.

He was a real piece of shit to me and my sister. There are a lot of things he did but this would get longer if I say them. One is that my sister told my mom about it, my mom called his mom and they just showed up to my house. When they showed up, there was no apology, he knew what he did. The mom did all the talking protecting him and saying he was a nice kid, while he just sat there doing nothing. Couple of weeks after we had a semi fist fight. Nothing really happened because the bell rang and had to go to class.

He got saved and lucky, because if that happened right now with my 24 years old, I would probably have left him in the hospital. 

It just fills me with anger the fact that I did nothing about it, I never stood up to him. I found out a couple of years back that he lives in my city and I just wish I could find him and beat his sorry ass just to see his mommy cry about it.

It bothers me to be like this after 10 years, I guess the best thing is to not think about it and let it pass."
Can't make friends,"Everyone in my school, hometown and probably a lot of the people (kids and teens) in my country are not stupid per se, rather unwanting to think. I'm very different. And to make it even worse, I cannot simply talk to people (can't even fake smile) and I don't know why. Almost all of my friends go to a very different school and I talk to them maybe once per month at best. The only friend I have still left near me is starting to mock me for everything I say, do or even own (like clothes that aren't designer or something). And my school friends are the same as the rest. All of them smoke, listen to their stupid brainless music (german rap, it has nothing to say and contains mostly swears that make all of them think thats edgy and cool) and are just these stereotypical 14 year old ""depressed"" kids.

My point is, I can't make friends because people find me awkard for not being able to talk to them properly and because I don't like the people in my hometown because of reasons stated earlier. I am a very ""nice"" person and I couldn't tell someone in the face that something is bothering me because they might think that I think I'm better than them. But they think otherwise. Point stuff out that makes you uncomfortable and insult you as they please. I don't know where to look for people without going on a drive. I just don't know what to do."
"I'm a bit insecure about my body, and that makes me sad when I think too much about it.","Specifically my arms. They're not thin noodly arms for my age, it's just that all my life the top part of my arms' been covered in weird red freckle-like bumps, they look like angry rashes or something (but doesn't look as unhealthy). Kinda noticed it again when a girl I liked sat next to me and both out arms kinda brushed against each other for the duration of the ride. I'm not sure if the contact made her feel uncomfortable or what.   


Makes me a bit insecure wearing a t-shirt now, because I usually wear a shirt to work and that covers up the bumps."
My girlfriend´s little sister (4) died today a awful death," 

Im sorry for my bad english but I have nobody to talk about this ...

The little sister of my girlfriend died two hours ago and I had to watch it ...  
Her body parts got demolished by a motocycle chain that flew around from a bike accident.

I babysitted her and we walked into the city and I bought her ice-cream and we stoud at the street to just enjoy the moment as at once and a motocycle crashed near us with 100 Km/h into a car ( in a zone with a 20Km/h speed limit) and the chain just broke und tored of her head ...

I will never forget this moment when her head hit the ground and her facial expressions ( I cant explain how she watched but it was horror.

I dont know what to do now ... Im very close to kill my self.

I CANT HANDLE THIS SH\*\*\*T RIGHT NOW

Please guys

Can you please comfort me a bit ...

Im really sorry for my bad english guys ..... ;("
I'm born in a prison.,"my country (tunisia) is a prison, most people have depression, average salary is 800TND (300 dollars), you can't travel, you can't shop online, you can't buy games without a third party service that will buy the game for u then sell it to you for an expensive price, most internet speed limit is 8mb where i live, the most one u can find now in fancy places is 20mb

thousands of people try to run away from this through the sea to italy, knowing that they can die , but they don't care , cuz they can't find a job here anyways, they aren't living, corruption exist everywhere, if u don't know someone who can help u (for ex to get a paper you need) you won't get shit.

school system is shit, classrooms are a mess, windows broken , the bathroom doesn't have toilet seats.

and a funny thing, u can go to jail for hugging someone from the opposite sex in public, applies to kissing as well..."
"""just leave the tray, its their job to clean""","This morning as my mom and I left the front door to my apartment to take the elevator down., We came across a huge dump of cardboard boxes and junk just sprawled at the lobby. Someone was too lazy to bring them all downstairs to the big garbage bins. Clearly it was thrown out for someone (cleaners) to clear, but it isn't their primary job. 

I said to my mom how inconsiderate the person is and how bad I felt for the cleaners who have to clean their mess just to mop the area. Mom just laughed and replied ""its fine, You got to give them a job to do."" Needless to say, I didn't bother trying to argue and started my day off irritated. 

Mind you, she would YELL at me ever since I was young whenever I would attempt to clean the table and bring my fast food tray to the collection shelf. ""It's dirty"" ""the cleaners won't have a job"". I still can't bring my head over how people can say that without thinking twice. Sure it's their job, but man it doesn't mean you can't be a decent human being and clean up after yourself.

My Dad died and half of my friends haven't said a thing,"I my Dad died at the end of October, less than a month after my 18th birthday. He had cancer in his neck that metastasised from an unknown location in his body. He couldn't speak for the last month of his life because the tumor paralyzed his vocal chords and needed a feeding tube because he couldn't swallow. It's safe to say I'm now a fanatical supporter of assisted dying. He had 0 quality of life, and I just wish he could have had some dignity in his death rather than being slowly strangled. He was 50 with long brown hair, picture Aragon from LotR, but with a tube in his stomach and a breathing hole in his neck. He was still so handsome and positive even when he was dying.

My best friend's Dad died of cancer too in August and we have supported each other as well as have other friends who came to my Dad's funeral, just kindness. 

But some people who have heard about my Dad's death through word of mouth, and who I thought were my friends, have said nothing, no acknowledgement no nothing. I was talking to a 'friend' and I told him about my Dad's death and he said, yeah I'm sorry about that, I heard from x who heard from x. I was thinking to myself, why haven't these people said anything? Literally a 2 sentence Facebook message would be enough. 

Interestingly enough, others who I haven't spoken to in years really surprised me. Really heartfelt words, telling me that they were genuinely thinking of me and that they have gained a new perspective. 

Death really does polarise the genuine and the fake. Sorry for any typos I'm too tired to proof read "
"No job, SO left me, no money and feeling hopeless.","Fired from my last job and been unemployed for almost a year, filled out over 500 applications, had a handful of interviews and still no job. Spouse took my kids and I'm alone. My funds have depleted, I have NO money. I'm staying with a friend temporarily. Disfunctional family that has had enough of me, my problems and I can't turn to them for help. I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm frustrated and desperate.

Thanks for listening."
What my coworkers don't know...,"Today, I put in my two weeks notice and an announcement went out to the company.

I don't have a job lined up. I don't have a concrete plan. I have my investments of knowledge and a cushion to find myself.

What my coworkers don't know is that I'm not worried about any of this. That place is political hell and I decided I can't live like that anymore. That new opportunities were on the other side of the door waiting for me to pursue them.

Am I nervous? A bit.
Am I scared? A bit.
Am I excited?... yes. Very

The world is a huge place and I'm excited to explore it. Things can go very wrong very quickly with any plan of action. So why not take some risks? 

When my coworkers ask what opportunity I am heading to and they react in a judging fashion about me heading to unemployment I am undeterred. I feel sorry for them! not me. I had the courage to take a leap of faith in myself. 

I could fail hard. But I could also win big. Either way the end result will be me exploring life."
I was married 21 years. Have been divorced for 16 years. My youngest graduated college with a bachelor's and has decided to move out on her own.,"With her graduating and getting her own place to live my kids and I decided to go thru the attic. We found some treasures and memories and junk and thankfully I didn't have to walk down memory lane by myself. We had a garage sale and I finally purged my life of everything past. I gave the photo albums to my kids and passed out family antiques I no longer want to watch over. My kids laughed and amazed over baby teeth and locks of hair and joked about first drawings and pictures and memories. They all have their own lives going now. It is what we want as parents. At first it felt great, I felt free in my heart. More so than ever before. Happy to have the past out of my home and free to move on. Now I feel lost and alone. I remarried 6 months ago after being single for 16 years. My husband doesn't know how to cope with my sudden roller-coaster of emotions. Nor do I, what is wrong with me and how can I fix it, fast! I feel like someone or something in my life has just died and I should be happy, not sad."
I can't help but get depressed every time I see a beautiful woman,"I can never bring myself to just talk to women in public. I don't think it's the fear of rejection, but something else. And when I see see them walking somewhere or even just standing alone...I get so sad. I suppose it's the thought of never being able to be with any of them because I don't have the sack to ask anyone out or even say hello. I fear being alone."
I lied to the therapist.,"It was my first therapy session in 9 years. I'm pretty sure I lied about every single thing I said (including cutting and depression and drug use especially) He said his patients lie to him all the time, like he could tell. I wish I could go back and be honest, but I'll have to wait for a month till next session.

 I didn't realize how full of shit I've become. So that's been bothering me,quite a bit."
I don't want to let our relationship go (X-post r/offmychest),"Yes, I posted this on another sub, but I just want to get this out there.

I know I said I wanted to give you your space. I know I implied that if you thought we should break up, I would support your decision. But I don't.
I want to be with you. I want to do anything I possibly can to keep this relationship going. You said that I was your best friend. You said that we would see each other just as much as we did before you went to college.

Now you say you're not happy anymore, that you're not in a place where you think you should be in a relationship. You said you think you're ""cheating me"" by not being available. Every time we talk, you're with your friends! ""That's just because they're here and easily accessible."" I can be, too! I'll take the nearly three hour bus ride to get to you! I'll sit quietly while you and your friends study! Just the thought of your face while you study makes me wish I could see you one more time. You get the most beautiful look on your face when you're really zeroed in on something. I want to see it again.

I just want to try one last time. I know you don't think it'll fix anything, but maybe you've just lost touch with what it's like to be in this relationship. We haven't seen each other in weeks, and I just want to give it one last shot. You don't even want to try. You've given up. After all (I thought) we've been through, I thought it'd be harder for you to let go. I thought you'd be willing to fight alongside me to make this work. But you think it's over. What am I supposed to say to that? Am I supposed to show up to your dorm on my hands and knees and beg you to stay? Am I supposed to trap you in a relationship you don't think you can be happy in? I don't get how this fell apart so quickly.

The worse part is that you think the last time I saw you was a bad experience. You don't get that being with you is all I want. I'll admit that it maybe wasn't the most eventful time I've had with you, but just the fact that I saw you was good enough for me.

Now I'm going to ask if we can still be friends. Not just to clean both of our consciences, but because I really do think you're a crazy cool person. If we didn't become romantically involved with one another and met under different circumstances, we probably would've become pretty good friends. Plus, I may end up going to the same school you go to, and at least knowing one person will really help me get over my anxiety of not making friends. But I wish I didn't know you as ""just friends"". I wish I could get there, and it'd be like we were reunited. But that's probably not going to happen.

I honestly wish I could be mad, too. I wish I could hate you and leave you behind, but honestly, you were the best thing that's ever happened to me. If it weren't for you, I'd still be content working in a fucking Starbucks kiosk. I would never have even applied for college, let alone THREE. You made me feel like I was worth something, and now that you're willing to just let me fall by the wayside, that feeling is wavering. I know it's unfair to both of us to base my sense of worth on you, but I can't help it.
This happened. This was a really big chapter in my life. I'll remember it years down the road. I'll always be thankful to have you in my life, and I wish you all the luck in the world. I'm sure you will excel at whatever you pursue. I hope we'll see each other again, even if it is as friends. And even if you think we can't be friends, I'm not changing my college plans, because if I'm going to fall flat on my face, I'm going to do it on my own terms. I once told you that as an excuse to not go to college and stay a loser. Now I'm saying as an excuse to work as hard as I can to become a success."
Quarter-Life Crisis,"I don't know what else to title this so I thought sticking to the status quo of life was a good start. First some background.

I'm 28. I have a full-time job and a girlfriend who loves me very much. Life *seems* okay at first glance, but here's my problem.

I hate my job. I feel as though I've been pigeonholed into a dead-end career. I work for technical support for a major cable company (I'm the guy you talk to when you call for internet support). I absolutely hate working this job. Half the people that call in should never own a computer or tablet, a quarter the scum of the earth, and then there's the occasional 5% that are okay people.

 That's just the customers, the management is terrible as well. They pride themselves on getting you to 'do your best' and 'better your position' or 'move up in the company', but there literally is nothing I would rather not do. I feel like a slave bee.

I guess I'm probably just complaining, but I had bigger plans for my life. I told myself over and over I would never enter into the call center job atmosphere, yet here I am. A slave to the kinds of companies I loathe, becoming more and more cynical day in and day out. 

This weekend I called out three times, forfeiting my vacation pay because I just couldn't take it. One of those days my truck stalled and now I just found out I have a 500$ repair bill coming. Top that with 350$ a month in student loan payment, and 500$ in rent. I'm at the end of my rope. I make about 1500$ a month, which is substantial, but I have to sell my soul to do it. I have an associates degree in general science, but was put on academic suspension because of grades. That was 3 years ago. 

Truthfully, I just want to know what I'm good at. There's been hundreds of things I've 'tried', but I never stuck with them long, and every time I just feel more like a failure. I want out of this job but I can't sacrifice my pay due to my loans. I can't defer anymore because I've done so too many times. About the only thing I'm good at doing is playing video games and even that is mediocre. I have too much ambition to be only a laborer or worker bee my whole life, I want more. 

I want to do what I want to do but I don't know what I want to do. Ultimately I suppose that's the TL:DR version. I just feel like I'm not good at anything that can actually make me a living, and I'm so sick of my current employer but have no other decent prospects open."
I'm afraid... of being alive.,"I'm afraid of being seen.  I'm afraid of being invisible.
I'm afraid of being heard.  I'm afraid of being ignored.
I'm afraid that people are talking about me behind my back.  I'm afraid that nobody ever thinks about me.

I'm afraid of trying new things, because I might be terrible at them.
I'm afraid of trying new things, because I might be good at them... and then if I didn't continue doing them, I would be wasting a talent.  And if I did continue to do them, I might get better and better, until someone noticed, and then I would be subjected to... being seen.  Opening myself up to the possibility of other people criticizing me.

I cannot validate myself.  I have no innate self-worth.  I need people to place value on me verbally; I generally achieve this through making myself useful.  If I am not useful, I am worthless.  My life revolves around making myself useful.  I cannot wear nice things, because if I need to run through the bushes or crawl on the ground to help achieve a task, I would ruin them.  Or worse - I might not be able to perform a physical task to be helpful, because I wasn't wearing something made for utility.  By dressing up, I render myself potentially worthless.

I have a mild case of trichotillomania.  People don't take you seriously when you have trich, because they view it as a self-inflicted quirk instead of a disease.  They take you even less seriously when you tell them you have a mild case.  Nobody brushes you off if you say, ""I have a mild case of cancer.""  But tell them you have trich, or depression, and they discount you completely.

I hate my job.  But I can't quit, because I need the money.  I've considered looking for other jobs, but I am not qualified to do anything besides what I do now, and if I made a lateral move to a similar position at a different company, I would lose the benefits I've built up working for the same company for 5 years.  I would also be putting a strain on my husband, because we carpool to work - if I worked somewhere else, our fuel expenses would double.

My husband is a good person, but we are passionate about entirely separate things.  I support him in his endeavors, and he supports me in mine - we spend a lot of time in the same room, but we hardly spend any quality time together.  I feel like my lack of interest in his interests  causes us not to connect.  I feel guilty for not enjoying the things he does, because he has tried to hard to find a middle ground for us, but he is as unwilling to sacrifice his interests for mine as I am his - so we just do separate things.

I never learned how to compromise.  Things are either my way, or someone else's way, and I can either deal with it, or I can't.  When I can't, I cause rifts with friends and family, because they cannot understand how I can simply walk away from something because it is not what I want.  I am ""impractical"", ""impossible"", ""spoiled"", or worse.  I have guilt about this - but I would feel even worse if I partook when I didn't want to.  It doesn't matter.  I have guilt about everything.

I don't have dreams.  I don't have ambitions.  I think small, and act small, and I am afraid of everything, all the time.  Afraid of succeeding.  Afraid of failing.  Afraid of people.  Afraid of having no one.

I don't know how to stop being afraid."
I don't think I can do relationships.,"Every time I decide to date someone, no matter how crazy I am about them or how long I've wanted to be with them or how compatible we are, I want out of the relationship after a two to four months. I lose interest in sharing myself and being open all the time. I get frustrated with everything they do, even though they don't change their behavior and I know that, rationally, these things shouldn't bother me. I start to lose romantic interest, but I still really care about the person and want them in my life. If we giddily made any future plans together, I start doubting them and wanting to carry through with them by myself. 

I don't like this. I don't like hurting people when I leave them. I don't like being annoyed with people I truly care about. I don't like that I can't hold a relationship with anyone. I don't want to be alone my whole life. After being single for a while, I'll usually desire a relationship again. I don't understand why I always want out of them. Half the time, I want to get back with my ex. I don't like that I am this way.

I've broken too many hearts, including my own. Maybe I just need to be alone forever."
When did life stop being fun?,"Hiya, throwaway for obvious reasons.

I recently turned 26, and it basically started me on a long stream of quantifying factors of my life. The day itself was bad enough from my perspective, I just felt absolutely forgotten and I let myself dwell on the day. My brother's been fixing his house up so I was working on it all day, telling myself that I didn't care, but as the day went on, it sunk in more and ore, *neither does anyone else*

I guess since then, I've just been summing up things that have happened in my life and just not having it add up to much. Looking over the last few years in particular, since I left university, I've made no new friends, not seen anywhere new, not done anything noteworthy. All I seem to do is the same routine, of going to work, maybe meeting what few friends I have, and sitting around the house. I'm reasonably happy with work, but it's everything around that, that just seems to be no change. 

On the subject of my friends, I feel as though I'm increasingly distant from them. I have one group of friends, about 5 of us all around the same age. but more and more, I just feel like I don't get on with them. Our interests are all the same, but whenever I see them, all I feel like I contribute are bad jokes and banter. It's like I'm just part of the furniture, rather than an actual part of the conversations. Also, since this current spout of depression (if it is that, can't think of a better word) I find I'm just getting frustrated with them at the drop of a hat. I've known all of them for over 10 years, yet I'm taking offence to the kind of jokes that I'd happily dish out without a second thought. 

I think my social circle is probably what is getting me down the most. I'm a pretty quiet person anyway, but I find it really hard to talk to people I don't already know. Or rather I become super self concious of what I'm saying. I want to be able to talk to loads of people, to be the centre of attention, but I find it hard to find myself interesting or to talk about myself at length.

This feels ridiculous to put here, because all I have to complain about is a boredom with life. I honestly don't know what to do about it. I take the underground to work every day, and I just thought how easy it would be to even lean forward as a train was going past. But I caught myself thinking of how petty my problems are, I don't have anything worthy of needing to escape.

All I want to do is feel content like I used to. But I don't know what it is that I'm missing. I know that I feel empty, but i don't know how to change that perception of myself. 

Sorry for the rant, thanks for listening"
Mixed raced relationships,"Hi everyone! I hear a lot of good things about this community so I thought I would lay out something that's been on my mind for quite sometime. 

Right now I'm 18 years old and I'm studying business at a good university - I'm at a very happy point in my life. But right now something that's been on my mind is of course love and relationships. I've been falling for a girl that's of Asian descent and I really adore her in every way possible. However, I find it difficult to imagine anything beyond a friendship because of cultural issues. I'm of Indian (Hindu) descent with my parents both being from India and having strong religious ties to it. Even if I wanted to start a relationship with her right now I wouldn't be able to because of my parents. The idea of being stuck with marrying someone with the same last name as me some day really bothers me - regardless if I wanted to pursue a relationship right now or not. If I end up dating someone from another part of India my parents won't be satisfied - let alone someone of a completely different cultural descent! I don't know how to handle this, I feel like it's holding me back and it's just something I don't like thinking about at the back of my mind. Any ideas? "
"I'm 22, i still live with my mother, have no job, no car, lost my girlfriend of 3 yrs and can't even bring myself to do anything to change my life.","Every month I say to myself ""next month I will find a job"". My parents give me just enough money to go out with friends once or twice a week. I feel bad for still taking their money. I can't get enough motivation to do anything to change my life. I don't want to do some shit job for a low pay, even if I'm aware that I won't get anything better without any experience. I have never worked in my entire life. I have a brother and a sister and I feel that I should start living on my own already. I just can't get my shit together and this makes me feel really depressed, still somehow I'd rather sit on reddit than look for a job or something. I feel like a parasite. I should support my family. I don't smoke pot or anything, I am a normal, rather popular guy, I mean I have friends and all. I know this is not right but somehow I find work humiliating. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know what to do to get myself together, find a job, buy a car, rent a flat or something and start supporting my family like I should."
"Just got ""dumped"" via Facebook status.","Bit of a complicated story but I don't blame you if you don't read it. 
So there's this girl who I met just before Christmas, we talked a lot on Facebook and I asked her out eventually - we decided to give dating a go. 
We've both been dealing with a lot of issues so things had been bumpy, and at some point in late January she just stopped returning all my calls and messages, stonewalling me. 
I went through all kinds of states but she's been known to just shut people out when she's dealing with stuff so after talking to a mutual friend I decided to just let her know I'd like to talk things over. We talked, got along well, I asked her at the very end what she thought was gonna happen with ""us"". She kind of dodged the question, said stuff like "" I want to be friends but..."" etc, basically giving me the impression she needed more time. Over the next few weeks I wrecked my brain and heart trying to come to terms with my feelings for her, eventually deciding that I did love her but would try to go with whatever she felt. Now just about an hour ago on Facebook I saw a relationship status update saying she had been in a relationship with someone else for about a month. She didn't tell me when we talked. She's been ignoring my questions on the matter for ages, despite me being really clear on just wanting an answer for matters of closure. She previously told me she wouldn't just break things off when it didn't work out, but would talk things through. She's also ignored my calls and messages just now. 
Oh and add to that that I'm also dealing with depressions, I'm in my final term of my final year of uni, exams are in two weeks and I got a deadline for my MSci thesis which is maybe a third done on Monday. And I feel like I just want to drink myself senseless, go out and walk until I drop or just bash my head into a wall. She got my hopes up and then stabbed me in the back. I have no idea what I even should do. If you made it through the story of my misery until here... Thanks for reading. I just hope writing this will help me get it off my mind."
I think my girlfriend is breaking up with me,"Right before she went to sleep, she sent me a text saying ""I'm sorry,"" and I asked why. She said ""I'm sorry for everything.""
How do I respond? What am I supposed to feel?"
I don't want sex anymore.,"I'm going to preface this by saying that I suffer from major depression.   I've tried therapy, but it didn't seem to work very well for me.  I'm very seriously considering medication because shit's getting very hairy for me. 


I don't want sex anymore.  It's not that I don't masturbate, because I do.  It's not that I don't have sexual thoughts or fantasies, because I also do that.  I just don't want someone to touch me.  I don't want to kiss.  I don't want to have to take my clothes off.  I want to be alone.   I don't feel pretty or attractive or sexual at all anymore.  Even if I do try, I don't get aroused.  My mind's always somewhere else. When I do masturbate, I have to have some kind of noisy distraction like porn or something so I don't let my thoughts wander and start crying from an overwhelming feeling of inadequacy while trying to fuck myself.  Isn't that pathetic? 

I feel guilty about it.  All the time.  I'm very conscious about how it's hurting my girlfriend, to the point where I asked her for an open relationship so she wouldn't be dependent on me for sex.  She feels rejected and inadequate that I avoid sexual situations and never initiate because I can't bring myself to do it.  I used to have a really high sex drive.  Like, all the time.  Not once did I have a partner, male or female, who could keep up with me.  I felt guilty and weird and like I was imposing my stupid needs and my stupid genitals on them.  

I guess the turning point was, after weeks of him barely touching me, after weeks of having to cajole him into any kind of physical intimacy, my then-boyfriend cheated on me.  With a girl that I would not consider my equal, intellectually or in terms of attractiveness.  Of course, he lied about it and I later found out through a friend.  The funny thing was that he had spent so much time before that trying to convince me that he really loved me and that he was just depressed and that I shouldn't worry because I was the best. He only wanted me.  I was *special.* It shouldn't really affect me anymore.  It was a while ago and he's a cunt with his own problems anyhow.  It was his fault completely.  He admitted that, and I even I have to concede that I rationally know it.

 I haven't felt right since.   I feel like I don't matter.  Like it's stupid of me to try.  I just want to shrink back into myself and stay there.  "
I drank a whole 1.75L of bourbon in three nights...,"I have an issue with compulsion.   I can't stop what I'm doing.  Goes for video games, hobbies, and yes, even liquor.   "
Why did she do this?,"Ok im a 17 yo guy and in my junior year of High School. I am by no means popular, but I have my group of friends that I usually hang out with, but recently I met a couple of new people a grade under me. This one girl I never really gave a second thought about asked me out to see a movie. I was really surprised- I don't consider myself very good looking, I'm not popular and I can't really make conversation- so this would be my third official date. Anyway, I don't assume anything, up to the movie I'm reserved, don't make any moves besides paying for her ticket, thinking it could just be a 'movie with a friend' to her. Bout halfway through movie, she reaches over for my hand, eventually lays her head on my shoulder, movie continues with various levels of hand holding ect. Head to her home for dinner with her parents, we end up hanging out, and watching Tv, her laying on top of me on the couch. Great evening, happiest i've felt in two years. Depression = gone. Next couple days, wont return my texts except for little one word answers, eventually updates her Facebook status as in a relationship with her EX, that she broke up with two weeks ago. Killed me, almost literally. ""Hey u/danyguy201, whats up?"" Her excuse- she actually didn't want to be with me but didn't have a way to say it, she didn't mean to have me fall for her. Soooooo, here I am again stuck in a deeper depression, trying to find solace in the internet. Please someone explain why it's ok to play with a vulnerable guy's feelings like this. I never asked for anything, I never made a move, and so she just left me by the wayside."
My dog won't make it past 5 if my step-dad keeps feeding him the way he does,"We have a pug named Otis, and my stepdad refuses to feed him properly. He regurgitates food into his mouth, and has gotten Otis to where you have to feed him kibble by kibble. He refuses to eat out of a bowl. 

Now, he refuses the dog food unless he's absolutely starving, because he wants people food and treats only. My stepdad feeds him treats like it's nothing. Treats no longer mean ""good boy!"" in this household. They've become a huge chunk of Otis's diet. When I ask him why he just showers Otis in treats, he says ""Otis really wants one!"" 

Now the people food...candy, chocolate, ice cream, anything on his plate...just everything. ""A little bit won't hurt."" Since when did ""a little bit"" mean the majority of his diet? 

His excuse for all this? ""He's gonna die sometime, at least he'll be happy when he dies at 5."" This is the same guy who always says ""I want Otis to live forever."" 

I've tried talking to him about this but he refuses to listen. "
"I am addicted to the internet, and the useless social media","After long quarrels with family, I think I finally matured enough to realize I am truly addicted to the internet and social media, computers and games. I find it very disturbing and it's really hard to find an easy way out.

After reading a few relevant highly rated books I decided to quit Facebook.
And I wasn't even using mobile data, I just happened to be around and on Facebook since I arrived home and almost till I went to bed. I know this might sound ridiculous but it hasn't been 24hours and I'm starting to crave for information and the feed wall.
Sad thing though I know I am far from lonely with this problem, but others don't want to fight it.

I am trying my best at finding goals for me, setting up projects, work out time consuming plans, but whatever I've tried yet I still end up on the computer staring at reddit, scrolling stuff and answering people on Skype.
I feel like I spend so much time here, wasting my young life, while I could make use of my imagination somewhere, and working with my talents.
Any comments would be appreciated."
The person who lives above me,"Why must you stomp around your apartment all day? You walk as if you are in a marching band. The pictures on my wall shake. I use to hate the girl that lived above me a year ago, but you are much, much worse. You wake me up at 6am. I have complained to the apartment manager to no avail. I have knocked on your door at 630am, when it was unbearable, and you didn't answer.

I wish there was some way I could just get back at you for all the wake up calls I never requested. It feels great to complain to someone. At this point, I just want to do something equally as annoying - even if that is not the best way to handle this. I feel I have exhausted my options in handling this like an adult. Any suggestions?"
Dad thinks expiry dates are meaningless.,"My Dad has no problem eating / drinking / using an ingredient / etc if it has passed the expiry date. I'm not talking about the bread that is a day passed, or the box of pasta that expired a week ago. He thinks its perfectly acceptable to drink juice that expired 8 months ago, or use deli meats that expired over a week ago ""AS LONG AS IT HASN'T BEEN OPENED"" 

Now, I could be way off when I say this (honestly), but isn't the purpose of an expiry date to tell the consumer when it is no longer recommended to use the product?

When I ask him if the sandwich he made me for lunch has any expired ingredients in it, he takes it personally and gets angry and violent at me. Sometimes he just dances around my question, not giving me an answer.

Me: ""Hey what's the date on this muffin?""
Dad: ""Smells fine to me""
Me: ""No, is it expired? what is the date on the package""
Dad: ""Son, I just had one. they're fine.""

Occasionally for dinner, a part of the meal will taste sour or something to that effect and someone will complain. 

What my family says:
-This food doesn't taste good because it's expired

What my Dad hears:
-This food tastes bad because you don't know how to cook.
(and no amount of talking to him makes him understand)

If I try and throw away something thats expired, he says ""Even if you wont eat it, I will. Put it back and I'll eat it."" Problem is, he doesn't eat it. He eats the fresh food like everyone else and our cupboards fill up with expired food.

I had a girl I liked come over and she wanted a snack. I was so embarrassed having to tell her as she takes things out of the cupboards ""that's expired, don't eat that.""

Money isn't a concern. We're a very well off family so my Dad isn't trying to cut costs by eating expired foods."
I feel like I'm shallow.,"I went on a coffee date with a chick I met on OkCupid. She was nice and interesting, but she was also had kinda bad teeth, was pretty fat and had a hunch, think pear shaped but...more than that. There's no way I'd take it to the next level.

Now I'm pretty lonely, don't know anybody since I just moved to my town, and I'm not exactly a prize pig. I've dated girls that are overweight, but this was over the top. I feel like a piece of shit."
Husband is finally doing what makes him happy and I'm just lonely,"My husband is finally doing things that he's really enjoying. He's got a nice job and is going back to school for what he's always wanted to do. And I'm so happy for him.

But I'm spending a lot of time by myself these days because those things take up a lot of time. Large chunks of my day are just me. I'm working through quite a bit of anxiety and depression (my husband knows about it and I am seeing a therapist for it) and I really could use someone around more often. I guess you could say that I have a lot of separation anxiety lately.

I love him to death and definitely don't want this to come between us. But every time I bring up my loneliness, I feel like I'm trying to take away from what's making him happy. Which I really don't want to do since he's come a long way in his own depression. 

I need a new solution other than just clinging to the times he is around. Does anyone have any suggestions? Aside from the ""just make friends"" stuff because I am working on that too. It's just tough when everyone has other classes or work schedules. Everything is just really tough. My husband and I have planned to do what we can to match our next semester classes as much as possible to get more together time, but I need a solution to last until then.

I also have other anxieties since I'm having trouble landing a job with my odd schedule. Money is a little tight but manageable. (Another job would push us out of the worry zone.) Which I think adds to the tense atmosphere. If I could just land a stupid job, I would have so much damn alone time."
The fact that suicide is a thing,"For 11 years I struggled with depression and suicidal ideation. Sometimes I spoke to people who had similar issues. About two years ago I was in a mental hospital again and decided that it was time to either kill myself or not. I chose not to kill myself, obviously. Once and for all. Life got a lot better. I believed in my future, life is insignificant but also it is beautiful, blah blah blah. 

One of the people I got closest with while talking about depression and stuff killed himself a few days ago. I am super upset about it. I know life sucks and stuff but he should not have done it. He asked me for help a while ago and I offered him everything I could but he didn't really do anything about it. 

I take life one day at a time and that has worked for me, but it didn't work for him. I am tired of people killing themselves. I wish everyone would just stop killing themselves. And talking about killing themselves. 

I feel like I am supposed to understand because for so long I struggled with it too. ""To be or not to be"" really is the question, and I guess it is a decision we all have to make. But I can't accept it. 

I am mad at everyone. Life is a weird gift and individually we are so insignificant, but that takes the pressure off, that is part of what makes it beautiful. I am very upset. I miss my friend. I know he made the decision and didn't want to do this anymore. But there was another way out of the misery and the darkness- he did not need to die to get out of it.  "

"Kneecap popped out today, life feels over.","Today was the first day of soccer conditioning, after about an hour my right kneecap popped out. The medical term is patellar dislocation I believe, and it happened after some running and playing. It hurts like a bitch, the swelling is bad and my knee looks like a lump. I can't walk or move hardly. I bet after my visit to the doctor's tomorrow I will be sent to physical therapy and that worries me because my mom doesn't have all the money in the world. I feel like such a fucking burden, I got $70 cleats, my mom paid $75 for a camp that I entirely just fucked myself for. I don't even know if I should go on with the season, I feel pathetic and such a flake. Everyone else, the good players, will continue and have fun while I just sit and cry like a baby. I also was supposed to take my driver's test tomorrow, but with my right leg being my dominant one, and having it practically disabled for the time being, I know I won't be able to drive and take the test. School is starting on Thursday and I won't be able to drive myself and all my friends whom I told I would be able to drive will be disappointed in me fucking up like usual.

I hope you think of me as much as I think of you, but in the back of my mind I know you don't.

"I hate my appearance, I feel that nobody likes me, and I have constant negative thoughts","Alright, I don't even know where to begin. I guess there's a lot of stuff bothering me. To give you an idea of my situation - I'm a guy in grade 11 of high school. I have a pretty normal family, and have had a pretty decent life. It's only recently (3-4 years) that I've been feeling negative in regards to my appearance and my personality. Actually, I feel negative in regards to almost every aspect of my life. Not just appearance and personality, but interests, popularity, possessions, and overall outlook on life.

I'll start with how I look. I'm a pretty tall guy, and I weigh about 185 pounds. I don't appear that overweight, but most of the guys I know are either skinny or extremely fit. I feel like I am the only one who is neither of those things. Also, I don't like the way my face looks. I just don't like it. I consider myself fairly unattractive, average on a good day. I have pimples on my face and up until recently also had braces. I have terrible eyesight and need to wear glasses, but I hide my glasses at school as I feel I look much worse with them on. I also find that I can never have a good haircut, and I hate the appearance of my hair every time it is cut. I have tried multiple styles and have felt unattractive each time. As well, I find that no matter what clothes I wear, I find that I look awful in them. I've tried various kinds of shirts, pants, and shorts, but I hate my appearance no matter what I am wearing. On a related note, I also hate the appearance of my possessions and my room. I move around my room ever few weeks or so, hoping to improve it. No matter what I do though, my room still looks too 'young' for me. This means that I feel like my room is immature, despite how much I like it. Even if I love the way it looks, I am fearful of how others would see it, and have to change it again. A good example would be my love of Star Wars. Several years ago, I was a big fan of Star Wars. When I learned that this wasn't something other people liked, though, I threw out everything I had relating to Star Wars. Even though I loved it, I got rid of it all in an attempt to be popular. The same goes for my room. Even if I love the cool Doctor Who posters in my room, I'll take them down in an attempt to seem cool and mature. Unfortunately, nothing I do helps, and I end up getting rid of my possessions regularly. I am briefly happy with the result each time, but then the negative thoughts set in again and I feel a need to change it again. The same could be said with my clothes, as well - nothing I wear ever looks good, but I keep trying in a futile attempt to be better looking. In hopes of perhaps changing how I look and making a difference, I joined a gym sometime in February. Unfortunately, the number of times I went dropped drastically around June and I haven't been back since. I keep meaning to go, but I never feel up to leaving the house. I don't even like to go out to the mall or the park because of how self-conscious I am. If I am in public, my only thoughts are how people are no doubt judging me, even though I know it isn't true. I can't be happy when I'm out of the house, no matter where I am. 

As for my personality, I have tried changing who I am many times to fit in and make friends. I truly believed in 'being myself' for much of my childhood, which alienated me from many of the people I grew up with, as I was obnoxious without realizing it. I try to be significantly more subdued and unobtrusive now, but I simply can't connect with people without fear that they secretly hate me. I do have a few people I would consider friends, but every day I wonder if they really like me or not. I have no evidence that they don't in fact simply tolerate me, which leads me to believe that that is what is happening. I'm sure that isn't true, but that doesn't stop me from being unhappy when I'm not around them, and distant when I am. In an effort to make sure they do like me, I often try too hard and make things awkward. An example would be when I tell a joke that makes them laugh, and then all I do is tell jokes until it is repetitive and driven into the ground. I recognize that this is something I shouldn't be doing, but I crave approval from them so much in the moment that I do it anyway in hopes that this time it will encourage them to like me. As well, I find that once I'm less worried about whether they like me or not I work less on keeping myself in check and therefore don't ensure that what I say won't drive them away. With a combination of all of these things, I find that I don't make friends easily and that I lose friends that I have. In regards to girlfriends, I have had a few, but most of the relationships have ended very quickly. Not one has lasted longer than a month. I have two theories as to why this is. One might be because each day the relationship goes on I am more convinced that she doesn't like me and ultimately don't like being around her. The other is that she breaks up with me, and I can only assume this is because I am not an attractive person in terms of appearance or personality. Either way, each time a relationship ends I find I am less inspired to seek out a new one. I find I am under more pressure in a relationship than I can handle, even if there shouldn't be any pressure involved. It works the same way with friendships, but thankfully I am able to handle the pressure of being in a friendship. That doesn't mean that I don't constantly question myself around my friends, though. It just pains me to be around people who I think are pretending to like me - not because of how bad that would be. I expect that, I would consider it reasonable. I just feel a desperate need to be liked by at least somebody, and if I don't know whether my friends are my friends than I am brought down constantly. Unfortunately, no matter how I change my personality or attitude, the situation doesn't seem to change.

Wow. I really didn't expect to be writing that much. I don't even know what I'm looking for here, I just thought it'd be a good idea to see what people have to say to me. Thanks for listening."
Speaking about my teenage problems,"My name is Javonte and I’m a 15 year old boy who’s a nerd that has no life and is socially awkward. I know this might just be a teenage problem but I need to talk about it somewhere. Since I’m socially awkward I have no friends, no life, or no girlfriend all I do is sit in my room watching YouTube and play whatever game I can find on my xbox of course with no friends. 

  I really want to fix these issues but it’s hard for me because I have no one to talk to about this. I’m starting to think about what my future is going to be like whenI try to go for a career if I can't even hold a conversation for more than 10 seconds or will I be able to have a wife and kids( I doubt many females like awkward guys). Having no friends also gave me low self esteem so I tend to avoid having to talk to people because I don’t want to make it awkward so I become socially distant even from family. 

  My awkwardness probably came from my hard time being vulnerable that’s why I’m speaking about my problems on Reddit( it was hard enough for me to write this) and not to my mother because her words won’t really help it’ll feel bland and not very sincere(it’s because I live with her and she knows everything about me except this) I also feel like I’ll be judge upon in a bad way from many people. The answer would be to obviously speak to people more but it’s harder than it looks because I’ve been dealing with as long as I can remember and I can’t just do it because my mind will start to think negatively and I’ll look down upon myself thinking that they probably think I’m weird and strange for whatever reason. 

  I don’t want to be like this forever and I know I have to put effort and work into fixing it but it’s extremely difficult for me and I’m sure how.

  
  Note: Sorry if it was kind of all over the place I’m just trying to put my thoughts into words."
Why do people treat me this way?,I am one of those human beings that have never had a true friend before because people judge me for being myself and telling them who i am. I just dont know why people are assholes to me all the time. Is it right for me to get this? Why do people not understand? Why doesnt anyone care for people who have a hard time socializing. I have autism and it does hinder my socialization experience by people thinking im weird or stupid. I dont want any advice here i would like real friends who understand me. Yes it really bugs me that people arent nice to me. I tried keeping it to myself for the last 2 decades and i cant take it anymore. I dont want to date i just want true friends. People is this too much to ask for? Why are people so hard to work with? Again I dont want advice i want REAL FRIENDS😥. Please if you really hate society like me and want to get to know me just send me a pm and look at my profile.
How do I become a funny and witty person?,"Ever since this pandemic stuff started I haven’t been feeling the same, i used to make everyone laugh and make up my own jokes. Now I just feel dull and not the same. I’ve been depressed throughout the entire pandemic and I had really bad anxiety issues in the beginning weeks. 

Whenever I try to sound funny or use my wits it just sounds stupid it’s like it faded away. I’m no longer depressed or have anxiety, I’m just not feeling the vibe I was feeling when I was in school, it makes me feel demotivated. I rather opt to a better position and come back to my friend group fts and make it worth their otherwise I pretty much have nothing to talk or joke about. 

I haven’t really been watching any funny youtubers, comedians, or shows ever since (some recommendations might boost my mood)
What can I do to get myself back into my original position? any advice helps."
love,"have you guys ever just loved someone so much you cry ? is that normal ? i’ve been dating this girl and she brings so much happiness to my life, i’m so grateful to have her in my life. sometimes in the middle of the night i’ll just cry thinking about her and like is that normal"
Being ignored on social media,"I realize that this is a relatively trivial matter amongst other people's posts here, but I need to get this out of my system and no one I know is available to listen to me.

Basically, being isolated in lockdown has made me wanna reach out to high school friends I haven't talked to in a few months. I didn't have many friends in high school, was extremely socially awkward, but I reached out to this one girl on Messenger who I hang out with whenever I go home from college. It went great at first. She responded enthusiastically, seemingly reciprocating my desire to connect back with her after a while.

She doesn't respond to my messages for days after I send mine. It's fine because I thought that she just doesn't go on Facebook/Messenger much which is the same for me (though I do get notifications on my phone for Messenger, so I don't do the responding-after-days thing). She was really nice when I knew her better, so I wasn't concerned over her late replies.

Well, I went on the app for a rare occasion today because I wanted to tell her news about people from high school, but I saw that the app said she was last online 3 minutes ago. And it's been nearly a week since I last messaged her. And she still hasn't looked at my messages yet.

Now, I might be overthinking and misunderstanding, but I'm pretty sure she's ignoring me.

At first, my heart was racing because I was embarrassed about being so excited to talk to her after a while. Then, I was just laughing/scoffing because of the absurdity. I was bursting to tell her the news and it seems that she doesn't care to talk with me. Now, I'm just like meh but also low-key insulted.

Oh well. I hope I'm not affected too much by this because I'd hate myself if I couldn't go to sleep tonight ruminating over this.

I also realize that I might be overreacting because she does have a tendency to not reply after a few days. But also, who goes on Facebook/Messenger and purposefully ignores messages? Maybe it's a thing. I don't know. Do people have so many friends that their notifications are backlogged for days by the sheer number of messages they receive? I doubt it. Maybe I'm just too friendless and it's actually more common than I expect. See, this is what tonight is gonna be like for me. I'm not gonna sleep. I hate this."
"Everything in my life seems to be going to hell, How do I get it all back together?","Heard that this subreddit can give some nice advice to people struggling with their lives, so I guess I might try. I'm an 18-year-old high school student who can't necessarily be considered a popular kid, I'm quite overweight ,not to the point where I can't walk but quite rotund, double chin yada yada yada.., got some hairs growing in awkward places such as a unibrow and a patchy teenage beard, basically enough for 0 people to find me attractive, all my friends seemed to have gone through a glowup and now looking like your typical 10/10 tiktok stars while im left there looking like trash.

I've also never been what people may call stylish, always wearing off-brand clothes and just regular sports shoes, and it didn't really bother me up until last year, it seems as if everyone suddenly became fashion geniuses at school, wearing expensive streetwear items and having dozens of pairs of expensive basketball and skating sneakers, which makes me look not only extremely pathetic, but also like a homeless person whos just found some off-brand trousers on someone's porch. 

the last nail in my social life's coffin would probably be the fact that I'm starting to figure out that I like one of my guy friends, and as a guy who's never had feelings for another man it all comes with a constant rush of emotions that I feel like is going to drive me insane. It has been going on for some time, about 9 or 10 months, started with me and the guy just throwing some of the casual 'gay jokes' every group of guys has, then suddenly understanding that I like that person and that it's way beyond just 'being gay with the homie' for me but not being able to get a word out because of low self-confidence that's fueled by all the reasons I've written here.

What's even worse is that he's probably not even into me, I've been throwing some clues here and there but haven't had the courage to just straight up tell him... He's probably a straight guy who's never going to love a man in his life, making my life even more miserable. I'm honestly so tired of this situation and am so hopeless at this point I'm willing to do whatever is necessary to feel alive again, just like back in the day... Feeling very lonely at times so I thought I'd share it here since I don't have anyone to talk to who will listen and understand, thanks in advance for reading all of this mess hope I didn't make it too long, I don't usually write long Reddit posts but I felt like this was important."
I need advice on a really difficult situation.,"This is incredibly personal and long and I made a throwaway account just to get it off my chest, I’ve tried to omit any identifying details because of the nature of my story, but I had to get this out and honestly I don’t have anyone to talk to about this because really, I’m not the one who needs sympathy here. I have a dear friend, we’ll call him Noah, who has a twin brother we’ll call Jamie. I’ve known Noah and Jamie since we were children, we grew up together and our mothers were friends before Noah and Jamie’s mom died when they were teenagers, they lived close to us and we were always together as kids. We went to school together, and they are both wonderful people, but Jamie is very sick. He started acting “strange” when he was a child, Noah says it was around 7 or 8 that the family started noticing it.

Sometimes he would say things that didn’t make any sense, or respond to something no one had said, or laugh at completely inappropriate times. He was screened for asperger’s and other types of disorders on the autism spectrum, but it was determined that his issue lay elsewhere. He was diagnosed with disordered schizophrenia at the age of 16, and by that point he was not doing well at all. He and Noah had always been extremely close in that stereotypical twin bond sort of way - they always seemed to know exactly how the other was feeling, what they were about to say, even when they couldn’t possibly have known. Noah has always been fiercely loyal to his brother, to the point of getting into fistfights at school with kids who made fun of him.

They’re 30 now. Noah was dating a girl I’ll call Stephanie for almost a year, and he seemed happy with her, but she never liked Jamie. Jamie, when he was thinking clearly, went out of his way to avoid talking to Noah about Stephanie or interacting with her whenever his brother was around, because apparently she was really mean to him sometimes but he knew how much Noah cared about her and didn’t want to be the cause for his relationship crumbling. Jamie spent some time briefly institutionalized after a series of upsetting incidents in which he kind of lost it and ended up hurting himself during some kind of violent, screaming, terrified fit. Noah tried to explain that he wasn’t a danger to anyone, he’d just been so scared of what he thought he was seeing or hearing, but Jamie ended up in the hospital for several months.

So Jamie comes home eventually, and since their father is an asshole, Noah agreed to become Jamie’s legal proxy of care, being responsible for Jamie’s well-being entirely. Jamie moved in with him, he was taking his meds and going to psych appointments and seemed to be doing well. I would go over to their house and play video games or watch movies with them, and whenever Stephanie came over Jamie would just quietly retreat to his bedroom. Noah picked up on the tension between them, and asked Jamie about it, but Jamie insisted that he was just shy around girls and Stephanie made him nervous because he wanted her to like him.

One night about a month ago though, Noah canceled a date night with Stephanie because Jamie was having a bad, really depressed night. Noah curled up on the couch with him and made him eat something and put on his favorite movie and texted Stephanie to apologize and explain what was going on. She was absolutely furious, and she went off on him for it, but he firmly told her that his brother is always going to come first for him and if she can’t accept that, then they weren’t going to work, and hung up on her. She came over to his place a few days later to “make up” but the minute Noah left her alone with Jamie for a few minutes to run down the block and get something from the store, she pulled out some bullshit.

She told Jamie that he’s being selfish, that Noah’s entire life has always revolved around taking care of him and keeping an eye on him and protecting him and that deep down, Noah resents him for it. She told him that if he really loves Noah, he’d try harder to get his shit together and set Noah free from the burden of him, she said all kinds of terrible things and triggered a massive depressive period for Jamie. Noah couldn’t get him out of bed in the morning, he wouldn’t eat or shower or anything, and he’d been doing so well the previous day that Noah was like “Jamie, what the hell?” and Jamie cried and told him that Stephanie had been right, which led to Noah storming over to her apartment to scream at her like “What the fuck did you say to my brother?”

This resulted in a major fight between Stephanie and Noah in which Noah called her a bitch and told her that she’d had no right to interfere with his family business, and she was a piece of shit because she didn’t even care if she pushed Jamie into a suicide attempt as long as she got what she wanted, which was for Jamie to leave them alone. She told him that she’s the only person in their lives strong enough to be brutally honest with Jamie because everyone else is afraid of triggering him, and Noah told her that he didn’t want to see her ever again and came over to my place to cry on my shoulder.

The thing is though, I get it. I get why Stephanie was frustrated, even if she was an asshole to do what she did. I know it must have been hard to be in love with someone and have their entire life dominated by someone who needs him so much and so constantly. I know it must have sucked to have Noah always canceling dates and things that were important to her because his brother needed him. I know it must have been hard to have Jamie there with them all the time, just sort of hanging out when she’d wanted alone time with her boyfriend. But I also know that Noah could never be with anyone who didn’t love Jamie too, and who didn’t understand that Jamie is always going to be his priority.

The problem now is, we’re all in each other’s mutual group of friends. There has been a lot of shit talking and taking sides and everyone is splitting off into smaller groups now because it’s awkward for all of us to hang out. Stephanie has a lot of support, because apparently Jamie being 30 years old means that he needs to get his shit together and stop relying on his brother to be his support system, and Noah absolutely refuses to entertain the notion of sending him back to his psych facility. Personally, I’m with Noah on this one, none of our other friends have a twin and none of them could understand. Jamie is literally all Noah has, but things are really weird and tense between everyone now and I don’t know how to fix it. I hate how things are right now, especially with all of us quarantined so we can’t all just get together and talk this out in person. 

Noah is a mess, and desperately struggling to deal with maintaining his brother’s schedule and well-being while dealing with losing his girlfriend and about 75% of his closest friends all at once, and he’s been leaning pretty heavily on me for emotional support. On top of all of this, Jamie has been extremely depressed ever since the night with Stephanie, and no one can pull him out of it, which is awful for him and making things harder on Noah. He is trying so hard to be strong and pretend everything is fine and normal for Jamie’s sake, but Jamie knows him too well and he feels incredibly guilty. Any advice on how to deal with this situation, or help either of them, would be really appreciated. Thanks for reading this, anyone who did."
"I feel like this is it, the moment that could change everything.","And of course, in my cryptic title I do mean that ""this is it"" for me. My last opportunity to seize a life that's full of meaning and excitement. If I fail, I don't think there's anything out there for me. Not only am I tired of relying on other people to feel meaning and excitement, I don't believe I can (nor should anyone) even if I wanted to find it in others. 2 of the 3 people I ever loved and felt connected to absolutely destroyed me. To be specific, #1 Stranding me in the middle of nowhere across the country #2 Ghosting me after agreeing to plans, having me travel faraway to meet up. And #3? I was in a relationship with and we broke up - basically because I said I didn't feel as strongly about her as she did about me. 

So, I am looking towards a career that'll put me into a position to positively impact people's lives in a way that I find exciting. As you can imagine, it's a tough career field to get into. And unfortunately, I fell off the damn wagon, I was putting a lot of effort to get into it and I eventually fell apart. Now I can't find it in myself to do what I need to do. Why? Well, besides the fear of failure, I am somewhat content with doing nothing. As in, I could literally sit in my room all day, everyday, doing almost nothing and feel ""content."" I say ""content"" because obviously there's a small yet significant part of me that wants to leave a legacy, make an impact - make a purpose out of my meaningless life (I consider myself an existentialist, and I believe life is meaningless, you ascribe meaning to it). And the fact of the matter is, I can't sustain myself doing NOTHING. 

So I need to push myself to be productive and make this a reality. But I don't know how. I think I just gotta push myself to do a little each day, and hopefully I end up doing more than I am pushing myself to do. Why waste a way a day bullshitting it away, just to forget about the minuscule amount of pleasure I got out of it anyways? Might as well do the crap I don't want to do, but need to do to in order to get into the field, just forget the pain, tediousness and minor inconveniencing as I do the minor pleasure I've experienced doing nothing. 

Lastly, I don't know what to do about the third person I mentioned. We recently reconciled and agreed to have a casual relationship (i.e., it's an open relationship with no expectations that we will get married or anything like that...). I really want to love her in a romantic way. Though, I do love her in some way. She's such an angelic, well meaning person, wouldn't hurt a fly. She's funny, intelligent and beautiful. But the romantic love hasn't been there for me, I suppose the ""chemistry."" A part of me fears that it was only because I was comparing her to my first love who I was crazy for (and well, she was person #2, so clearly she isn't even a good person) - but that could've all been situational (I was going through a lot and she was there for me + nothing beats your first love, it's like taking a drug for the first time...and you're always chasing that high - but you'll never have it again). Plus, there were plenty of reasons for there to be a lack of passion - because we rarely did anything fun and exciting together. We did quite the opposite, we'd spend a week together doing nothing in the confines of her apartment. And now I'm worried I might've lost my chance with her because she seemingly has forgotten being head-over-heels, all-she-thinks-about, in love when we were together. I'm hoping that the whole situation changes when we can actually hangout again. But this is just the cherry on top in my eyes - it makes everything going on with my aspiration chasing 10x worse, if I had my career in order then this alone wouldn't be bothering me enough to post. 

But bothered doesn't even hit the nail on the head. I am hurting so very badly. I've struggled all my life (and I am in my late 20s now). And I will admit I don't appreciate how far I've come. From a loner without social skills, friends or girls to a social butterfly that's realized friends and girls are nice (y'know unless they turn out to be terrible people), but they're not all that. 

Please help me out here, it feels like I'm drowning and can barely keep my head afloat. Thanks for reading and hopefully the advice/kind words."
I think I may have depression.,"Historically speaking, I've been a happy, easy going, hard working person, and thus far things have gone pretty well in my life.  Lately, I am just having real trouble getting motivated and focused enough to do anything, even things I enjoy.  It's getting harder and harder to do everything.  I know what needs to be done and I know I can do it, I just can't get there.  Even taking the dog for a walk feels like a real chore.  It's really frustrating.

Worse than that, I find myself getting very irritable over absolutely everything.  I'm snapping at people and just being a miserable sh\*t, even over something as small as somebody coming into my office to say hi.  I know in the moment that my behavior is irrational, but I just can't stop myself.  It's like I'm standing 3' back watching myself be an a\*\*hole.

I know that I'm not feeling or acting like myself.  I try to push myself through but it's just getting harder and harder to do.  But I have to do something, I'm afraid that things are just going to start falling apart if I don't.  I know there are options but I'm not sure where to start.

Anyway, I'm not sure what I'm expecting by posting this here.  I haven't shared this with anybody and I just had to get it out somewhere.

Update: This post is probably the first time I've ever articulated how I felt.  I can't express how good it felt just to put it into words.  I've made an appointment with my doctor.  I'm not sure what's going to happen but for the first time in a long time I'm feeling hopeful.  Thanks all for listening."
crush,my best friend are best friend with my crush. my best friend knows i like her but my friend starting to catch feelings with my crush. After i know this me and him drifted a lot. i just want to cry
I don't know how to avoid kids (serious),"tw: suicide, pedophilia (not sexual abuse AT ALL, but I understand why people might wanna skip this one)

So I'm a pedophile. My AoA (age of attraction) is 6+, meaning I'm attracted to people from age 6 up, including adults (which technically makes me a hebephile, ephebophile, and teliophile but that's just semantics). It was just something that I found out when I was like 16 or so, not something that I did though. It made me majorly depressed and suicidal even knowing I had that attraction, but I eventually (like, years later) figured that life would be okay so long as I never had kids, generally avoided them if possible, and never did anything that could hurt kids (like watching CP or being a creep who wants the age of consent lowered). That was the deal I struck with myself to keep from hurting anyone, and if I ever violate that, I have this pact that I'll jump in front of the nearest train.

Heavy shit, but since then I've gotten in a badass relationship with a guy (2 days older than me lol) I love and intend to marry. He's made me so happy and so excited for the future; I wish younger me could see me now. He knows about my attraction and doesn't wanna have kids ever and neither of us are able to have them, so everything is set up that I don't even have to be around my own children. Still, I'm a very sociable person and I bet that I'll have to be around someone ELSE'S kids when I finally get to that age where my friends are having kids.

I previously got out of hanging out with kids by just saying I'm bad with kids, but then when they persist, I clearly have no actual problem dealing with them. I'm actually pretty good with kids, but like hell I'm going to voluntarily hang around them!

I guess I'm really just am looking for an excuse that isn't ""Sorry, I'm a pedophile."" Cause yeah, that'll work to get them off my back, but I'll also kms after. Should I keep just lying and saying I'm bad with kids? I dunno, as I'm getting older and being around more parents this is stressing me out..."
Afraid of Death,"I'm a 15 year old atheist. and ever since I was young I always wondered what it's like to die.  Death scares me, When I think of it I always wonder if I will ever see my parents again, or if I can do the things I like again.  I don't like the idea of living forever. I always think that I will be bored and will have nothing to do when I reach a thousand or a million.

What do you think will be the most effective way to overcome my fear of Death?"
Ending life,"I always keep talking myself out of it.. But i am really tired. Nothing seems to work out. Nothing. I have been unemployed for 2 years. I have been rejected by all companies national and intenational. I can't    get any clients when freelancing. I was forced to go back home to live with the parents. They said it would be better if i found a job here so they get to see me. But i don't want that but i pleased them.. Everything for them right. I rejected a fucking offer to come live with them. And they keep asking for more.. I'm spent and tired and they keep telling me that they have given me a choice whereas they did not. They think that by getting me to ask them for anything will replace the need i have for making a solo life for myself. I just wanted to be alone make my own decisions.. Have fun, go out maybe date. But here with them.. Everytime i want to go out i haveto ask for money which is embarrassing for me to do specially at age 25. And they keep asking a shiload of questions, and if i come home at 10pm they flip. This is the part they don't get, that i am NOT a baby. If something happens let it happen it does not concern them anymore. Otherwise why did they give birth to me. I did not ask for it nor did i ask to live.
I am balancing them on one side and fighting hard to stay alive. And i am tired. I just want it to stop."
This isn't the life I wanted but this is what I got.,I'm so unhappy about how my life is. I didn't want this and now I turned out like this. I feel like it's too late to change. I'm just a screw up. I'm always fucking things up.
My anxiety lets external factors determine my value as a person and assume the worst,"Especially the people who I have/had sexual and/or romantic relations with. Then I go through a series of mental rumination. 

No reply even though it's only been a few minutes? They're not interested anymore because they hate me now

Something just ""feels"" off? It's definitely my fault. What have I done wrong? Why don't they like me?

I guess a little bit of anxiety over someone you're interested in is normal, but mine feels debilitating. I spend so much time thinking about it compulsively, and yes part of that is my clinical ocd, but I just wish I didn't think this way. 

Also makes me think if I'm really THAT desperate or lonely

I'm getting help, and trying, but life is just full of random events that make me anxious :("
"Next month I'll know if my Papillary Thyroid Cancer has spread or not, and the only thing I can think about, in case the results are bad: I don't want to leave my wife behind.","I know what I'm suffering from is common and highly curable, but I can't shake the feeling that it might have spread, just because it's a possibility. If it has, 90% chance it's fatal. It's the worst case scenario, I know, but my mind works this way.

 I'll know next month for sure.

My wife and I have been married for less than a month. She's the kindest person I know. A colleague asked me yesterday ""what's next?"", like, if I'm fine then we'll buy a house, have babies... That's ""easy"".

But if I'm not... it didn't occur to me before but the worst thing I can think of is that I'd leave her behind... she doesn't deserve this.

We truly love each other, it's a perfect match, we've been together for 4.5 years and we never had a fight, ever.

Disagreements, sure, but we never yelled at each other, we are never mad at each other.

We are still young, 32 & 33, she'll recover eventually if something happens, hopefully, but we've planned on getting old together, with kids, dogs, a house. I don't wank to shatter her dreams in any way.

Sorry, I just needed to vent, thanks for listening."
I Feel So F****** Empty,"Hey guys, i'm a 20 year old male who lives in Europe. To explain my problem to you, you'll need to know my weekly schedule. I'm still in school where i have many friends, I talk with a lot of people and am kinda funny guy in their opinion. After school I go swimming ( 4x week ), Where i am also not un-popular. This is during the week but in the week-ends I mostly do stuff with friends like go and do some fun stuff (paintball, karting, jumppark) or go out for a drink or just game with some friends till the early hours. 

&#x200B;

Everything in the previous sentences i find a lot of fun. But when i'm alone, or at home just behind my computer i feel so fucking empty. But the problem is I do a lot of stuff, for example today i went to help a friend with his new home. Helped him clean the place up, had a couple of drinks and laughed a lot, but when i got home the only thing i can think about is the time i get to do stuff again with friends or just go to school or swimming to do stuff.

&#x200B;

Am i depressed i've asked myself? Why can't I get satisfied with the many things i do on my own time or just with friends?Some background info about me : I'm not an intro or extrovert. I can be really quiet with people i don't know or just talk the whole time. It's just like I feel like i'm missing out on some stuff. Doing too little and wanting to do more.

I really don't know why i act or feel like this and maybe some of you guys have had this too.

Wife's stepcousin shot his wife and himself,"So yesterday my wife told me that her cousin put 3 bullets in his wife and then killed himself with the same gun. Apparently she might have been cheating and this is how he handled the situation... very poorly. They just had a baby less than a year ago and we're very close in age to my wife and I. Last I heard the wife survived and is in critical condition... I cannot imagine what my wife's uncle is going through. I truly hope the mom pulls through, so that poor baby will at least have one parent. I lost my father to suicide a decade ago, but this is just pure insanity..."
Isolated because of autism,"My family has all stopped interacting with me since I was diagnosed with autism. My family has big holiday events that I'm not invited to because I'm a ""retard"". Then they call me up just to tell me how much fun they had. I have been written out of my family's will, everything goes to my step-siblings because they're ""more productive"" in life.

I have recently become a shut-in because no one wants to even talk to me. I have no friends because either, ""You don't look autistic"", or ""You're just lazy, suck it up.""

I have never been hugged, kissed, etc. But I do have a kid because I was taken advantage off during a meltdown. Courts sided with her and that a guy can't be sexually assaulted. I love my son, don't get me wrong. But I have never had a real relationship in my entire life. I have always been used and manipulated most of my life and I feel like giving up.

I'm posting here because I want to feel better about life. I'm to the point I feel like giving up and that it's not worth carrying on anymore. To give reference, I'm almost 50 and I've been dealing with this since I was 8. I just want someone to be my friend in rl."
I hate who I am and where I am,"I'm gay. I'm ridiculously gay. You know that person in the class who everyone knows is gay? Yeah, I'm that person. I would love to be open about it, but I live in a shithole of a country which is religious and homophobic as fuck. I'm scared and scared for a reason. 

I told my mom that I'm bi (small lie) a couple of years ago. She got angry and we never talked about it again. Can't imagine telling my dad or anyone else.

This atmosphere is sufficating me. I literally feel out of breath from time to time. There is constant pressure on my chest.

I also think I'm in a deep depression and I can't go to a psychiatrist because of the freaking social stigma. I need to travel to a different city and pay by cash to cover it up but I don't feel like I have the energy to seek help.

"[M-22] At 9:00 tomorrow I am expected to hand in my University dissertation, and have written nothing.","I suppose this post is not really about the stress of doing a dissertation, or my worries about whether I can complete it and pass university. No, that ship has sailed. Its more about the, now certain, failure of my degree and the pain and frustration of the last four, now wasted, years of university life. I'm worried for my future, not just because of my impending academic failure, but the person I now am after what should have been the trans-formative growing up years of my life.

Its hard to start from any specific moment or event, as to how I ended up at this point. Over the course of four years, things in my life just slowly drifted from an organised state where I had real potential achieving my goals and growing up into the adult I should be, to this ugly, passionless, existence where I seem to have regressed in my ability to do anything. I have failed not just my academics, but every other piece of university life - from extra-curricular societies to meaningful friendships, to having something as small as having a clean room. It makes it so much worse that while failing university I was not in the pub, or fucking a girlfriend, or experimenting with drugs, or being 'that douchbag with an acoustic guitar at parties'. Most of my time was spent in my room doing nothing. Fucking nothing. I've managed to take the shittiest parts from all the different segments of university life and mash them together into a frankenstien of shit, apart from its not a frankenstein its my life. 

Its worse when I consider beating my problems, something I've tried again and again. Once a year I'll have a moment, where I realise the issues in my life, I'd wake up to it all and start honestly trying to improve things. I'd visit the doctor and the therapist and start trying to fix things, but as quickly as I gain motivation, it'll die away and I'll stop bothering to come to appointments or do anything about it. This is what really kills me, knowing full well what actions I should take but being aware that in a month or so's time that fire just won't be there anymore. To simultaneously want to get better, but to self sabotage all my attempts to fix it is so awful and to go back to my zombie state of video games and reddit browsing - not because of some evil influence on my life, but because I don't feel like it anymore.

Anyway, thanks for reading. Its currently what I feel about my life right now. I'm probably going to go back to trying to forget about all this soon, maybe even by tomorrow morning I'll be watching a DOTA2 stream and doing my best not to think about my future, but its there and its bothering me."
"My boyfriend is leaving for college, deep down I'm terrified history will repeat itself.","I've been dating my BF for 4 years, have an age difference of only a couple years, and have a very strong relationship. I absolutely see myself marrying him, raising a family with him, growing old and wrinkly and incontinent with him. The works. My family adores him, plans on him being an in-law, and I feel very welcomed and loved by his family as well. There are not enough good things I can say. 

That all being said, I have a nagging worry. When my BF first went off to college, he went to an exclusively engineering-centered college. Long story short, he hated it, got very depressed, and essentially flunked out. It probably didn't help that I'm going to a different school but am doing absolutely fantastic and love it. He's been nothing but supportive, but I can only imagine that it would be hard for him (I guess the mentality of, it seems so easy to her, why can't I do that?) 

Over the past year, he got back in touch with a great connection and is now pursuing a completely different degree. It won't be easy, but it plays into a part of his life he is very passionate about. Since being accepted and getting ready to leave (in just a few days!) he is acting similarly to the way he was when we first started dating. Very happy, more energy, even just a different look in his eye. This really helps me feel like he's in the right place, but I'm still scared. 

He says that what caused his downfall at the last school was that he'd either get bored with a class or confused or whatever and just stop showing up. He'd start gaming and just not go to class. He's got a lot more pressure now (everyone is keeping a closer eye on him, and not wanting to let the person down after they helped him get set up with the school), but I just hope that's enough.

I'm also afraid to tell him that there's a lot more at stake here than people being disappointed. He knows that my mom's ""blessing"" for us to marry is important to me...while she adores him, she has said in the past that if he can't, for lack of a nicer phrase, get his shit together, she personally feels that I shouldn't promise a future with him. I understand her reasoning, and while a marriage is so much more than a career or an income, her input has always been valuable and, honestly, spot on. 

Part of me doesn't want to talk to him about this because I don't want him to feel like we are anticipating him to fail or add more stress. But at the same time, I feel like this is a big deal and I kind of want reassurance from him. 

It's just been, you know, bothering me."
Is it so hard to be decent humans to other humans,"Remove physicality and notice how quickly the banal gender norms you carry stapled to your forehead are just stereotypes, fulfilled by your need to fit in some else's rubix cube. To like football, to be a douchebag,  to placate others through soft emotion, to wear what you want, all of these things are subjective to YOU. Not requirements given by the title you believe you are. They are level and human qualities, not categorical stipulations.

Shit, I[M] love makeup. Did yall know it Makes you less ugly than you think you are? I was taken back, like ""you tellin' me I can look better but not look like a crossdresser or clown. What? That's ridiculous.""
So why do guys, who have figured out how to alleviate the beautification standards set by others around them get treated like they broke some unmentioned law of the universe.  Just because it is a predominantly female asset does not mean I am female, nor does it mean I wish to be one. I wish to be me...just better looking. 

The same for girls. You do what you like. Being a douche nozzle is not a selectively male trait. Choosing shorts and comics, over skirts and barbies does mean you should be a guy, nor be treated like one.
 It means you like what you like and do what you do because you like it. Save for those who have the chemical anomalies which make them  uncomfortable in their physical form, there is not a goddamn thing wrong with you in your own form.

What the fuck is acting like a dude or a girl anyway? 

Being an asshole means your an asshole, being tough is tough, having a soft heart means you have a soft heart. There is no ""acting"" like you completely replaced your reproductive organs for a few minutes as a spider landed on you.

Come the fuck on with that.  

Unless you are an organic chemist specializing in human body systems and you check the levels of testosterone and estrogen appropriated to what we DEVISED as a classification system, which has only separated us more as time goes on shhh.  
 Keep quiet..no I said hush..shht. not another word. 
(Yes there are physical differences between the male and female forms, I got that. If you made it this far than hopefully you've read the first two words of my post, cool? Cool.)

Life is a fluctuating spectrum. Not a point-by-point plot, as much as we'd like it to be. There is no reason anyone should feel like they are alone in the ""inbetween"" of life,  because yall were more focused on not helping them accept  themselves, and being critical of your fellow human rather than helping them feel accepted and human at all. 

Jim should not feel like the wrong human because he cries a lot. Nigga has feelings, that's ok. Mary shouldn't feel like she doesn't belong because she thinks boxing is cooler than getting her nails done. (Weak example, but I'm not totally aware of the plights girls face that would make them seem boyish and then  mistreated)

Damn. 😂 😂 😂
Be a decent person. Guttersnipe ass people man..

What do you guys think?"
Who knew glandular fever could ruin my life?,"Last year I went through a major upheaval in my life. I dropped out of year 12 (senior year?), moved 3 hours away from everyone and everything I knew, was homeless, and was honestly ready to just give up.

I got myself out, finished high school, completed a few different courses, found somewhere to live, got enrolled in university to study justice and confirmed what I wanted to do career-wise, which was to join the police force in my state. I was so determined to do this, I've never had any goals I've been willing to work so hard towards.

Then I got sick. I had glandular fever (mono). Got the usual illness, was sick for a few weeks and then got over it. I was well for about a week when I went to visit my grandparents. A few days in, my back started to ache, though I thought that was just because I was driving grandma all over the place and wasn't used to that. Over the next few days, I couldn't eat, was feverish and shaky, was starting to get sick again. We thought maybe I just wasn't over the sickness and went to the doctor. She gave me pain and nausea medication and a shot to make the nausea go away, none of which helped. 

It was time for me to go home. The morning after I got back, I woke my boyfriend and begged him to take me to hospital. He took me to the smallish hospital near our place, they did test after test and decided it was best to send me to one of the biggest hospitals in our city, as whatever it was, they weren't equipped to handle it. It took a week, a bone marrow aspiration (using six needles instead of the usual two, on the bright side I have very hard bones), a platelet transfusion, and a PICC line (a line travelling down a vein towards the heart, used to take blood, administer meds etc.) to discover what was wrong. I had a rare blood infection, one that can be fatal, which can either be genetic or from infections like glandular fever, in my case. I had an enlarged liver, spleen and very low iron and platelets. They treat it with steroids and 40 weeks of chemotherapy. I was terrified.

Fortunately for me, by the time they figured out what it was, I had started getting better on my own and only needed steroids as treatment. Alas, I was weak for months, I still get exhausted very easily and sometimes my back still hurts where they took the bone marrow. Regardless of this, I bounced back, started my uni course, and was so bloody excited about my future. 

Last month, my heart started racing as I was washing dishes at work. I thought nothing of it and continued pottering about. The next day it happened again during a driving lesson. My instructor took me to the hospital. Test after test on my heart, couldn't find anything so they let me go. The next week I had an ambulance called for me as my heart rate was 130 while I was just sitting in class (average heart rate is 70). They let me go, pending further appointments with a cardiologist. I went and saw him on Thursday and he said it's one of two heart conditions, there are to be further tests but one of them is conveniently caused by 'having had a viral or bacterial infection, like glandular fever'. Wasn't too worried, they're both easily manageable and generally wouldn't cause issues in my day-to-day life. The next day I had to tell my teachers about it (if my heart rate increases I need to leave class and lie down). One of them is a former police officer and was on the interview board for the academy, so I asked her how having this would affect my chances of being successful. She said she'd ask her friend who is a medical officer, but it's very unlikely I'd be accepted. 

I am absolutely gutted, I got home and cried for the rest of the night. This was my dream and it's been completely torn from me by some stupid illness. I was so proud of myself, I've worked so hard and was so excited for my future and now my chance at that is gone. I don't know what to do."
My friend is cheating on his wife,"Where to start? 

We'll call them John and Jane. My boyfriend and I used to work with John, then my boyfriend got a job as a manager at another, much nicer, place, and was able to get a position for John. Then John got his wife hired as just a weekend part-timer.

Now, these certainly aren't our **best friends**, but we double dated a few times and I would consider them to be in our friend circle, even if it was just the outer circle.

When John worked with us, there was a girl who had told my boyfriend that John had been flirting with her and telling her that he would leave his wife for her, but as this was the first we had ever heard of it, we didn't want to think he was too serious. 

But now, at this new place, where Jane also works, there are three girls saying that he said the same thing to them. Then one of the girls finally just straight up tells people that she had an affair with John. Not just a one time thing. She would go to John and Jane's place on the weekends when Jane was at work. My boyfriend, who is now not only John's manager, but also the person who brought John in to this job to begin with, confronted him. He needed to know for sure if these rumors were true, but also felt like John should know that the people he and his wife work with know that he had an affair. 

So now the thing that is bothering me is that no one is telling Jane. Her husband is cheating on her, and while we only know of one other woman he's slept with, it's not like he hasn't tried to get with more. And on top of that, she is trying to have a baby with him and start their family.

On the other side of it though, Jane is apparently an abusive wife. My boyfriend has told me about texts John has shown him where Jane berates him, tells his he's a useless husband, and from what John says, she withholds sex for months at a time, only sleeping with him when she's ovulating to try and get pregnant. 

So I can sort of understand why John would step out on the relationship (although I believe if you can't be faithful then just get out of the relationship completely), but she still should know, for her sexual health (what if he contracts something, it's not like they use protection), for the potential child that would be born into chaos, and for them, because they clearly aren't on the same page at all.

I don't want to be the one to ruin a marriage, but at the same time I feel like John has already done that, and if it were me, and all the people I work with know that my husband is sleeping with my co-worker... Well I just know I would want someone to tell me. She deserves a heads up too, right?"
Broke up with my first girlfriend after two and a half years,"At the beginning of high school I met a girl. We started dating shortly after and we were together for two and a half years. It was my first girlfriend, and we lived many cool things together. But we always had some trust issues, she has never been fully open with me.

In recent times some things started to bother me more, because even talking to her, nothing changed. It wasn't something serious, she did not cheat on me. But I was no longer feeling well. She seemed to put me in the background. I was no longer a priority. So I decided it was time to end.

She said I was abandoning her. I felt a little guilty.

It's not easy to spend all this time together with someone and now, everything change. I feel a little directionless."
Seeing my ex boyfriend at work,"My boyfriend and I broke up a couple months ago, and we work together (I got this job while we were dating, but honestly, I wanted this job because it's a ~really good job with good pay)
I still miss him sometimes, but I won't lie, it's mostly a sexual desire. He comes into work wearing a speedo to swim laps and it's beyond frustrating. It doesn't help that I'm gay and live in a conservative area, so there aren't any potential guys to distract me. 
Anytime he comes into work, my mind goes crazy trying to find a way to convince him to do anything sexual with me, even making out. I'm just extremely frustrated. "
I have to put my dog down...,"Cocoa.  Named by my then six-year old son after the breakfast cereal that was sitting on the kitchen counter.  Cocoa is 14 years old.  We got him from the pound just before his second birthday.  He's been a great dog. Like most dogs, he's considered a member of the family.  Time has taken its toll.  He 100% deaf.  His eyes are cloudy with glacoma.  He is forgetful and suffers a bit of dementia.  His quality of life is rapidly diminishing.  Yet why do I feel like a murderer?  Every time I set a date, he snaps back into focus for a week, and then slowly slips down the ladder.  When is the right time?  When is the right moment?  I'm frustrated, upset, and confused.  I'm left to wonder what's the right choice and when??? "
I just got rejected from my first choice university,Everything just seems so pointless now.
I feel like I don't matter,"I help support my parents. They asked me for help when my dad became disabled a few years ago. They constantly make poor financial decisions I have to make up for, leaving me to live with them because I can't afford to fix their mistakes and pay rent/utilities.

In order to afford this situation, I am a store manager at a convenience store chain, which is a salaried position. I'm currently working around 75 hours a week and making just over $30k a year. It was a fight to get that much. I was originally promised just shy of $29k/yr with a raise in 6 months to put me over $30k. I was actually given $26k and nothing in writing and consistently lied to. Because nothing was ever given to me in writing, the best they could do was a merit raise now and no raise later this year when I'm due for one. 

I work hard, enjoy the work itself, and excell at it. But now they want to take all the work I've done doubling our profit over the past 2 years and undo it. Literally. I've spent hours upon days talking to customers and discovering what they want in our store and it's worked so well our board of directors and several officers not only ask what I'm doing differently so they can attempt to duplicate it, they also shop in my store.

The past two months have been extremely rough. Long hours, lots of added stress due to remodeling and increased sales and becoming short handed because they transferred someone into my store with the hopes I'd catch them stealing and now missing product due to some computer glitch that I get blamed for. Thankfully I do my work the way I'm told and document everything so I still have my job, despite being made to look bad.

My supervisor's boss came in the other day and shit on everything I've done. He has some other corporate types coming into the store on Tuesday to change everything to be the way HE wants it, despite his way being what nearly killed the store before I took it over. We have customers who've shopped in that store for over 30 years. Doing what he wants will send them to the competition. Arguing is almost pointless, but it's doubtful they'd fire the guy who's actually making the comoany money.  And if they did I'm sure I could easily find another company that would love to have my talents.

So having worked 80 hours last week and another 80 hours this week I was supposed to take a three day weekend. I'm physically and emotionally exhausted. I can't bring myself to eat and I'm too stressed to sleep. And someone called out. They said they were sick. It happensm I get it. So I covered that shift today. Then, 15 minutes into that shift, someone else called out drunk. How do you, honestly,  when seeking a promotion, call your boss and say, ""I just finished a bottle of hard liquor (it's 8am) and can't come to work tonight"" and still expect to be trained for promotion? So I had to call someone else to cover that shift because I'll be damned if I can work another 19 hour day. That person was supposed to be at another location at 6am, which certainly isn't going to happen now. So I call another employee and ask if she can cover that 2 hour shift. She agreed.

At 5pm she sent a text saying her ankles hurt and she needed to rest them so she can work out on Monday. It was going to be my last day off before another 15 day run because my assistant's grandmother is dying and I'll be damned if I'm not horribky jealous that he gets to fly out to visit with her before she goes because I was too busy paying for the groceries my parents squandered their money on bullshit to buy that I couldn't afford to go visit my own grandmother 2 years ago when she was dying. I could only afford to send my mom.

I'm heartbroken. I bend over backwards for these people and I can't even get 2 hours of someone's time. I can't get a, ""thank you for making us an extra $1.5 million dollars last year we didn't have in our budget to make."" I can't even get a solid fucking day off.

I just want to curl up in a little ball and cry.

Tl;dr: I feel like no one gives a shit."
I have a foreskin.,"I know it's the natural way to be, but still. I'm 14 and live in Ontario, where it's about 50/50. I guess that's an okay percentage, but I feel so alone. I'm still a virgin, but after browsing countless forums and questionnaires, I'm afraid that when it does finally come out, I'm going to be rejected. Girls in this day and age, especially teenagers, are raised in the western culture of circumcised penises being the norm. I remember bringing up foreskins once with some friends, and they all said ""That's fucking disgusting."" My mates who still have theres all describe them as short and not even noticeable when hard, whereas mines so long it can't even be pulled back all the way. I feel like such a freak and it's honestly discouraged me from even trying to get a girlfriend, because I'm scared of rejection. I'm in the minority here, but I honestly wish I'd been cut when I was born. I'd be a lot happier today."
I'm a failure,"Two mays ago, I graduated and soon dated a wonderful young girl.  I had quite a few close friends, was in a band, had great grades in high school, and life was pretty great.  This was probably the highest part of my life.  I then went to college, and didn't really meet anyone who stuck around to stay in touch with me.  Guess I never had much to say and didn't have strong enough interests to get involved in things.  

Anyway I guess I became depressed or something, and my mind became restless with weird existential thoughts.  Everything felt pointless, from classes that didn't interest me in the slightest to making new friends since they would be gone from my life like my old ones to even my then girlfriend, whom I cared about more than anything.  Just knowing that it would end made me crazy.  

So then, in whatever weird mental state I was in, I essentially gave up.  I failed two classes and was kicked out of university.  I pretty much lost touch with my former friends, and I became bitter and shitty, which ruined my relationship.  

There's worse stuff out there in the world no doubt, but I'm a spoiled white pos so this is all I've known.  

Turns out I was terrible at breaking old habits, and had to withdraw from another course and the tech school that I went to the next fall.  At that point I started seeing a doctor for depression, but both medications I received didn't have a noticable effect, and my mother seemed to think I was feeling better over Christmas break so we agreed to cancel future appointments.

I got off to a bad start this semester too.  If I have to withdraw this class again I don't even know what comes next.  

This is obviously all my own fault but it drives me crazy.  Just the tip of the iceberg.

Also it blows to come home, visit your grandparents (of course that part was nice) and then they show you that your ex is on the front page of the local newspaper essentially for being an exceptional musician.  It's good to see that she is just as amazing as ever and I didn't hold her back, but goddam I would kill to be part of her life again, just to cheer her on and watch her grow.  If I somehow just knew that I could've had some kind of lasting relationship I think it would've been enough to hold it all together.

Anyway, incoherent rambling beside, I just don't know what to do

there's enough stuff troubling to write about for days, and I guess I just am not strong enough to cope with it or keep it internal and not affecting my other aspects of life

tl;dr A student to flunking college, whiny baby about ex"
Someone went out of their way to try and invalidate my dyslexia :(,"Coming here to vent.

So, in a Uni tutorial, we were all divided into small groups to answer a sheet of questions.  Everyone read out the questions in a round. When it came for me to read, I politely excused myself because of my dyslexia - a request that's received with no bother.

But, one guy in the group said ""Oh come on, that's not an excuse! I'm dyslexic!"" To which I irately replied, ""I think you'll find it is!"", causing everyone else to laugh.

Then for some reason, he kept going and said ""Well, everyone else has already done it"", as that was supposed to somehow guilt trip me into doing what he wanted. I sighed, and simply replied as calmly as possible ""Look, I not gonna read it. It would make me feel very uncomfortable"". He gave in, but you could tell that he thought I was a dick for questioning his demands.

Fuck you! You wouldn't question a guy with CP for not doing sports, why would you do the same for a learning difficulty? As it that's somehow invalid - who the fuck do you think you are? And later you had the nerve to imply that I was acting cold towards you for not reason. Christ - I'm so fucking mad right now!

Whether it was done out of malice or ignorance, some people need to think a bit more about what they say to others before spouting their stupid, offensive opinions! "
My fish died.,"This sucks. I wasn't the most loving fish owner, but it was part of daily routine, feeding him (a beta named Pez) twice a day. I'm not telling my friends because I bet they'd just say it was my own fault for not cleaning the tank often enough. And I just don't want to deal with that. So yeah. Rest in peace Pez. I miss you. 

Edit: In case anyone was curious: his name was Pez because it's Spanish for 'fish'"
I'm crazy lonely,I mean I know I have a lot to offer. I'm not all weird and awkward. I'm just lonely!
I just ended my 5 year relationship/engagement,"We'd been dating since high school and so much has happened since then and we just sort of, grew apart. On top of everything in my life being overly stressful with being broke and in debt and trying to go back to school. Living in different cities finally took it's toll. I know I made the right call in calling everything off and we're going to try and be friends and see where things go. It was just such a tough decision and I feel like no matter what I did, it was a lose/lose situation.
Now we have to tell our families that the wedding is off and we're over. So close to Christmas too. But I deserve to be happy and so does he, and it just wasn't happening anymore.
I hope everything will be ok.
I hope I made the right decision.
I hope. I hope. I hope."
"I want to make native friends, but I don't party and my English isn't good enough for it.","It has been bothering me since I got in the United States this August. I'll stay here for one more semester, and I really want to know how I can improve this frustrating situation. 

I'm an male exchange student from Taiwan. My English isn't good enough for having close friends, especially for listening and speaking. Plus, I can't drink alcohol and don't know how to enjoy a party. However, I do want to make local friends though alternative ways.
I'm shy not because I'm afraid of initiating a conversation, but I worry people couldn't understand me due to the language barrier and they don't want to ""wait"" for me to finish a sentence. I don't want to ""bother"" people who don't want to listen to me, but I do want people to talk to me. Ironically, this dilemma bothers me. 

I tried many possible ways to gain more chances to talk to people. For example, I joined volleyball club and multicultural club. Also, I applied and got two internships during intersession and in the spring semester. Additionally, I am also a Chinese tutor for local students who take Chinese courses. I also have a roommate who is from Europe. I even applied for jobs in school. I tried hard to make me accustomed to speaking and listening English, but I still can't have lots of friends, especially American friends. 

How can I make this progress more effectively and appropriately?
What kind of thoughts/philosophy should I keep in mind? 
Is there any resource available to me that I can use for it?
What do Americans expect when it comes to making friends. 

Thank you all for listening. I just want to share with you. if anyone can give me any suggestion, I would be more than happy to see a response. Thank you in advance. "
I hate the fact that I'm circumcised.,"I was reminded of this tonight, and it's been bothering me for a bit, so proper subreddit for it. 

The tip of my dick is less sensitive than my shaft, balls, and even my fingertips. I'm talking the glans down to my scar about halfway down my shaft. When I receive a blowjob, I can barely feel her lips until she's about 2 inches from the bottom of my glans. She will have her mouth around it and move her tongue around inside and I can barely feel it. I can feel the pressure and the warmth, but no tactile sensation. As soon as she goes past my scar it lights up with the sensation of texture. Circumcision removes a protective sheath over the most innervated part of the male body, analogous to a woman's clitoral hood. Do any other circumcised males know what I'm talking about?

The only medically necessary reasons to get a circumcision, as far as I know, is if the dick grows funny at puberty, and I've also heard that it can help prevent HIV transmission. I would conjecture that the HIV transmission issue would be in poorer country's and regions with less sanitary conditions, less sexual education, and less condoms available, as I would imagine the folds may hold in more sexual ""juices"" from previous partners. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

I'm pissed off that I had no consent in the decision. There is literally no way to tell in what direction and how much a man's dick will grow at puberty, sans monitoring and influencing hormone levels. Everyone's dick starts at, I would guess, roughly the same size. It puts the baby's sexual future in jeopardy before they even know what their dick is for. 

I've asked my mom about her decision and she says it was a cleanliness and religious factor... THEN TEACH YOUR CHILD HOW TO CLEAN THEIR DICK! SHE'S A FUCKING NURSE! I'm bisexual, and I've seen big and small uncircumcised dicks face to face, and it doesn't seem that hard to pull back the foreskin and clean it. As far as the religious aspect, well, she had to deal with a baby out of wedlock with my southern Baptist grandmother. I can only imagine that kind of pressure. 

I have a great sex life, though. I've been complimented on my dick quite a bit, and yes, it is a lovely penis I've been blessed with. I have no problems with size, getting hard, stroking, and other various sex activities. But honestly, if my dick was any bigger, I would have tightness problems. I need a good amount of lube upon insertion to something, otherwise it pulls the skin back in a painful way. I've tore and bled from my dick when I was less experienced at masturbation before. I feel like I definitely dodged a bullet, though. But I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on a lot of sensation that I deserved in the first place.

Tl;dr Don't cut your kids."
I'm not very interesting,"I used to feel like I took *way* more than my fair share of blame for a conversation that died down. Then I realized that the common factor was that I never had anything to say. Ever. And when I did, nobody gave a shit because it either didn't make sense or was boring.

So, yeah."
I have no one to talk to and everything is going to hell.,"Sorry I just have to get this off my chest because I feel so isolated. I just moved to a new city a year ago, and my one good friend here is kind of flaky.  I had a social circle, called one of them a bitch and now I have no acquaintances (Yeah, longer story, my fault). I thought I had another close friend, but he was telling that same circle of friends what I had been confiding to him all along. 

So I feel betrayed.  My family is falling apart.  My stepdad has been cheating on my mom and was recently found out.  I broke up with my boyfriend (it was mutual) two weeks ago.  

I'm in grad school right now. I made a huge mistake.  I don't want to do what I'm going for anymore and I'm in a very specialized field so if I want to change careers I have to go back to school.  I'm in a ton of debt so I can't go back to school.

When I try to talk to family about my problems, my mom just says ""God has a plan for you."" Which is almost insulting and is certainly infuriating since I don't believe that at all. Plus, she then tries to convert me. And on top of all of that I feel horrible even bothering her because of what she's going through.  

I'm so frustrated and I have no idea what I should even be doing to fix my situation.  Thanks for letting me vent."
"Because of my short temper, I pushed away the greatest person I have ever met.","My ex-girlfriend broke up with me two months ago. We have been together for 3 years. I feel guilty and sorry about it because I never treated her right. I would always scream at her, said awful things and never listen to her at all. She said it was a nightmare being with me through those years. 

I wanted to get back to her. But she refused and kept saying that the same thing will happen over again. Three years was too long and I didn't do anything to change myself. I still love her and I feel like crap because she doesn't feel the same. I begged for her to give me one more chance. All she remembered was the bad experiences she had with me. There were never any good memories according. I blame myself for being defective, unable to love and be loved. I'm an awful person and I believe that I deserve to be lonely.

My ex is back in my life...,"Sorry for the long post... trying to summarize the best I can. 

One year ago I met this guy one night and we immediately hit it off. It started as a hook up and we just couldn't stay away from each other after that. About a month later I went 8 hours away to college. We Skyped every night and became really close and were dating, even though it was never official because he had some issues caused by his last relationship that he couldn't get over. 

Anyway, things ended around Christmas in a huge fight and we went 6 months without talking. In the mean time, I dated one guy for a short time and am now dating another man. Me and my current bf, have been dating for 3 months and are very hopeful for a long future together. 

Here's the problem: My ex is now back in my life. He's been here for a few months but we are just now starting to really talk again and it's so nice. He's opening up more than he did and we joke about the past. He's told me that he misses me and regrets some of the choices that were made. And I'm caught because he was the first guy I've had a fire for, and it never really died. But I don't know if it's because I still love him or because he was the best sex I've ever had and I'm dying to have that again.

Not that my current love life isn't good but it's just... my ex does this thing to me. I don't want to lose him out of my life again and I really do enjoy having him around but he's making me double think my current relationship, especially if I even love him because there isn't the same flame. I know it's stupid but I so desperately want one more night with my ex, but i'm sure that would just turn into one more and one more. 

It's basically how I'm living my entire life. Unpaid internship vs. paying job, college vs. traveling... it's all about planning for the future. I want the instant gratification of having my ex back now, but I just know that it could never work out between us. We want different things and we are different people. And my bf is the future, I can see myself with him in a long time, we get along and have similar values and want the same things. 

I'm just sad and torn because on the one hand, I really want to try again with my ex even though I know it wont' work. I just want him back. But at the same time, I can't think about giving up my current bf. 

It's a really stupid conundrum but I just needed to get it out because I haven't had anyone to tell and it's been weighing heavy on me. "
I live with a thief.,"I'm now out $500 and a piggy bank I've had since I was born. I'm fairly certain I know who's doing it, but I have no way of proving it and I know he'll just deny it if I accuse him. 

There's nothing I can do. Losing that piggy bank... I don't know why it hurts so bad, but I feel like I'm practically on the edge of a nervous breakdown. And I can't even afford therapy because that's part of what that money was for. "
I found out that my most of my coworkers don't like me and went behind my back to get me fired,"**EDIT: I did not get fired, but they attempted to get me fired
**
I have been working at a company for around 9 months now and I found out today from my manager that half of the project team that I work with really don't enjoy working with me and feel that my attitude at work is annoying and that I don't represent the company well.

Although some of their critisims are helpful and things that I can work on I heard from other co-workers that aside from this they are looking for excuses to get me fired as they don't really care for me. We work in small teams and travel a lot so there is a lot of one on one time with members of the team. I have always tried to be supportive and learn from them in the field and around customers but I think this may have come off as incompetence when I ask questions to them. 

I'm an extremely extroverted and social person and the team members that are having these problems with me are more introverted and cold in compassion. They don't seem to enjoy their work and they take it far more seriously externally than I do even though I do my job competently I know I can outwardly have a more happy go lucky attitude due to my personality.

What really stings is that what I have asked for feedback from my senior team members they have said everything is fine but they still went behind my back to management instead of trying to address the situation and talk to me directly. 

I'm at a loss because now I know while I'm at work that these people despise me and want me gone but I still have to work with them and try to correct my behavior which doesn't seem to fit me, my work style or my personality.

I know people will say I should just quit or transfer, I'm trying to transfer right now but it looks like that might be slow, and I can't quit my job right now.
**
TL;DR: Found out my coworkers hate me, can't quit, work is becoming unbearable.**"
I'm VERY conflicted right now.," I've been on and off about this situation. I would like to say I might be depressed by self diagnosis. I feel numb and nothing seems to really make me feel alive. Everything seems pointless and I've come to an all time low where I think about committing suicide. Not to end the pain or anything like that, I just don't see a point in living. I have no friends accept one, and I think I might love her, thing is it's not as easy as just telling her this. I have no future and I think I'm not smart enough to make it in life. I feel I will always be dependent on people. 

Let me start off by explaining my situation with friends. I have none. At least not the type that share a mutual feeling of companionship. I'm more of a tool, an object. An emotional punching bag so they can get their stress out. What gets me is I'm a pushover, I want to help people with things, I want to listen. I know some people say that its bad to be the nice guy, but I think that as long as someone is being good, then it makes up for others right? 

Onto my problem with my best friend. I know I said I don't have any friends, but let me make this clear, she will be moving soon. She does not go to my school, and she is also dating someone in the states ( We are in Germany ). I love her. Not out of lust or the sick idea of ownership, but it's just simple companionship. She makes me so happy and I feel alive when I'm with her. I know it sounds corny, but its true, for those brief moments the world isn't as bleak as I thought it was.

 Now onto why I'm upset. I know I will never be with her. She has a boyfriend in the states, and I think they are happy together. I on the otherhand am not very attractive. Along with this, I think she may look down upon me, but I don't know that yet. Honestly, I don't want to find out that this friendship is skewed. One of the ways I see it is that she feels like I am inferior to her, hence why she has to put me down sometimes. It's not in an aggressive way, just the way most firned spick on each other, the thing is, I don't pick on her, and I do my best to encourage her. One example is when she helps me cook. I have her prep things, and I know she isn;t used to it, so I try to help her. I don't chastise her and make fun of her for it.

Gah the whole thing is getting me confused because I want to see it from every angle and I'm trying to approach this open mindedly, but fuck. I hate this shit. I hate everything about me and I hate how I will probably be alone for the rest of my life and THEN I hate how when I take a step back and look at myself, I just look like a whiny little teenage shit and that anyone with a right mind would tell me to shut up and get over it. "
My husband has recently been diagnosed with an undiagnosable memory issue. He's 24.,"The doctor has given him 6-10 years before he can no longer remember the day before. 

I will answer questions about his condition as best as I can, but my anxiety is centralized around that... horrific timeline. 

I'm in therapy (have been since before his diagnosis for unrelated stuff) and am now talking about this. It's not enough though. We can really only afford her every two weeks and once I started talking about this the floodgates opened. I sat on it for a month or so before I brought it up. She's trying to help me find other cheaper therapy but it... well. You get what you pay for. She's helped me find some caregiver support groups in my area, and I haven't gone yet. Those people are all going to be children of people with dementia, which is just a whole different ball game than a spouse. 

I talk with him about what this means for him and us and our future a lot, but I don't talk about what this means specifically for *me* because I can't and won't burden him with my pain while he's dealing with his. However that leaves me with no one to talk to about this. We haven't told his family or mine yet. I'm not sure we plan to until they start noticing things. He's been exhibiting symptoms for a few years now and our families have been less than supportive. Due to his memory issues, he has quite the reputation as a liar and his mother has disbelieved a few of his symptoms in the past, as has my family. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this. I know I'm grieving. I have no one to speak to. I don't know where I'm going with my life anymore. We had plans. A future. A house, careers, perhaps children, traveling. He was going to be a doctor. Now he's doctor is telling him he couldn't possibly treat patients of his own, to choose another career. Children are also a bad idea. There's a 14-38% chance any child he would have would share his disease. I also have a form of arthritis which is genetic, so kids are way out of the picture. Which isn't a huge heartbreak, but it's difficult to have decisions taken from you, rather than having a choice. We'd thought about adopting but that's out of the picture now that we only have a few short years left.

It would be easier if it was cancer, because then at least he would die, or not die. As it is, I have to watch the man I love slowly slip away into a shadow of what he used to be and I'll be responsible for his care *for the rest of my natural life.* That's huge. I could choose to do it myself, but I would be giving up... everything. I could hire care for him, but... I'm in the care industry and... I know the risks you take with that kind of stuff. I really couldn't afford anything. I have a dead end job with incredibly minimal raises and it's in the care business! I'm going to burn out so fucking fast. 

We're looking at getting a second opinion, but all this nuerological stuff is so expensive, even with great insurance. Not to mention that my arthritis diagnosis is also incredibly new and I haven't even actually started treatment. Who knows how much those appointments and medications are going to be. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for here. I feel like I've lost my mind. This stuff doesn't just happen to people. This is stuff that you see on a soap opera, or a chick flick. My husband's symptoms fit no pattern. He technically has no diagnosis. I'm lost. 

tl;dr My husband is too young to have early onset dementia and whole life plan has just fallen to pieces. "
"im ugly, overweight, and cant talk to the girl i like.","Ever since I was little, it seems like I've been screwed over. My older sister was being treated like royalty, and i was pushed to the side. I've always been ugly, and over the past 6 years, I've been steadily gaining weight. I'm now weighing in at 280 pounds, and I'm only 14. Although I'm going to the gym, the weight keeps increasing, and I'm eating right. The girl I've like for the past 4 years barely pays attention to me, and whenever we are around each other, I have to tiptoe away because she's not paying attention. I'll try and talk to her, but nothing,happens. I've never considered suicide, but my options are becoming increasingly smaller, and I'm not sure my parents would even notice if I left. I don't know what to do, and I need help desperately. Here's a pic to put into perspective how big I am. https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/1150967_3271421602139_321185713_n.jpg

Online school sucks for me,"Have done about a days worth of work for 2 of my classes over the span of 6 weeks. All the rest of my classes I have completely ignored. I want to do well in school and jobs that I’m interested in require university degrees so you’d think I would try a little harder but although I WANT to try harder I can’t because ??? If the want to do well is there where is the motivation? I worry I might fail school and get a job I hate but I still don’t do school work. It’s similar when I’m physically at school but I do lots more work when I’m actually there and I actually listen and do work. I seriously hope we go back to school this week (it’s possible for my country) but in reality I should stop being lazy because I have nothing to do, all the time in the world to do school yet somehow procrastinate and have no motivation to do it"
Why do you love me,"If you ask your SO why they love you on the spot, and they can't answer, is that a problem?"
I've been feeling like I don't really fit in with my friends.,"For a while now, I’ve noticed a few differences that’s made me feel like the odd one out in my college friend group (about 4-5 people). At first, it didn't really seem to make a difference--at least, when it came to just hanging out, studying, etc. But now, it really seems like it's starting to. Let me explain.

The first difference that comes up once in a while is the fact that I'm the only one who has some form of shitty upbringing that's led to trauma and mental illness. Like, it's always kind of awkward when my friends bring up their parents in a normal context and I have to bring my dad up in the context that he's ""not a good person."" (actually a massive oversimplification, but oh well.) 

Not only has my shitty upbringing resulted in trauma and mental illness, but it has resulted in...weird mannerisms? Like, I have anxiety (though I wouldn't be surprised if I had other issues too), but somehow the only thing I can default to focusing on is my education. It's good in the sense that I can put my focus in my grades--and, as a result, have very high grades--but when it comes to anything else, I can't do it. I get crazy anxious over the fact that I have extracurriculars I need to to do, like volunteering. 

For one, my friends aren't high achievers like me, and for that reason I always make an effort to not talk about my grades. A while ago, though, I was talking to one of my friends (let's call him Q for now) about the education system changing and beginning to lean towards favoring extracurriculars over grades. I told Q that I actually wouldn't like that, given the way I am (good at getting the grade, not so good at extracurriculars). It didn't seem like a big deal at the time, but it came up again--this time during a phone call with Q and a few others in the group. God, the way it came up...Q essentially said something along the lines of, ""I know *you* like the system as it is, but frankly, *we* rely on a system where we're not defined by our grades.""

Damn, did it just trigger the hell out of me when he said that. I had to just leave the phone call abruptly because I literally froze and started crying. It really just made it so evident how different I was from the rest of the group. Like a slap in the face.

All in all, I wouldn't say my friends are crappy people. Q did apologize for what he said later and asked if I wanted to talk about it. But really, this just makes me want to talk about it even less with any of them. Bringing these things up just seems like it would make these differences even more blatantly obvious, hurting me more than helping.

Again, all of this is in reference to my friends in college. This is important to note because a lot of the friends I made in high school actually tended to have some sort of mental health issue as well, so I never felt out of place. Unfortunately, I don't really get to see my HS friends often anymore given some circumstances.

TL;DR I've been feeling out of place lately with my college friends because they haven't experienced a shitty upbringing/mental illness like I have."
Nitpicky English professor and teenagers at work,"I had a hard time sleeping last night, i have a lot in my mind and it's driving me a little crazy. I just returned to school this semester after not going for 13 years (I'm 32) and i I've always done good with English and the grade i got on my first paper isn't bad at all (B+). It's just that, when i went to read her feedback i was expecting something that would explain what i did wrong and how to to fix it. Instead, i got a rubrick chart showing how she marked my paper that basically showed she was contradicting what she told our class. 

Since it was our first paper she didn't tell us anything about MLA format or citing and said she wasn't grading for that , i ended up looking it up and kind've guessing at it when i typed my paper. I also thoroughly checked for grammar and punctuation. What does she do? She takes points off for both and for grammar /punctuation. I worked really hard on that paper and she takes points for the thing she wasn't going to because she hadn't gone over it. I was really hoping for her to point out what was wrong with it so i could fix it and make the next paper better. I can't write better papers if i don't know what I'm doing wrong.

Then, at work i'm the secretary but i act as the 3rd manager when the other two have left for the day (i do this twice a week). There's two teenagers i have the worst time with. Anytime i tell them to do something they act like It's a suggestion. I don't want to get hateful with them but i feel like i might have to if they won't listen to me."
Life is an RPG and I fucked up my build+Penis debuff,"I'd post this to r/SuicideWatch, but my posts have been removed in the past without explanation. Maybe they think I'm too much of an angry, edgy cunt. In reality, I'm too much of an oversensitive pussy to handle this life shit and too dumb to figure it out. And, unsurprisingly, I'm too much of a pussy to an-hero. Was looking into information about suicide methods and HOLY SHIT! Literally NONE of the options available to me seem like they'll reliably kill me, and instead might just leave me seriously crippled. I don't care if mom cries. This is a throwaway, but you can PM me. I actually really like talking to people, so I'll check back every now and then if a conversation actually gets going.

I guess I realized that I'm unfit for life when I was 10. That's when I first started thinking about suicide. I was an angry child, always screaming and throwing tantrums. A real pain in the ass for my parents. I ended up loudly proclaiming to my mom that I no longer cared and that I wanted to die. I ended up getting ""help."" Some help that was. Saw a therapist, but it didn't do shit. So I eventually just told my parents ""yep, I'm cured!"" because we were moving and I didn't want to go through the whole humiliating process you have to go through before you can ""get"" help again. I'm also broke with no health insurance. Truth is, those suicidal tendencies kept lingering on and on.

You know what my problem is? I'm an oversensitive little faggot. My feelings get hurt so easily, and I hate that about myself. I remember jerks in high school would be dicks to be and seem to feel nothing, but if I have so much as a social faux pas I feel really bad about it. I just don't get how people can just wipe off verbal razors and not care so casually. Even worse is that I'm pretty retarded and fear that I'm sometimes unintentionally rude when I never mean to be. I'm scared of social interaction and just feel so weird when I approach someone or have to talk. When I was a teenager, my mom would force me to go to parties that I didn't want to be at, and I just had NO idea what to do with myself. I think I might have autism or some other undiagnosed bullshit going on. Another example of my oversensitive fuckery. When I was fourteen, I had this crush on a girl who I was into WAY more than she was into me. I went on like, I dunno, TWO dates with this chick, never even kissed her, and it took my stupid ass four fucking years to get over her. Like, lmao what the fuck is wrong with me? How the FUCK do people manage this life shit?

Now, what's really weird, and what I think gets my posts removed from r/SuicideWatch, is that I think about circumcision A LOT. Let me explain. Each of my parents are atheists. So am I. Basically, I didn't even know what god or religion were until someone started talking about it in first grade and I just felt SO confused. Did not get it. For the first 18 years of my life, I did not know that I was, in fact, circumcised. The first time I heard that word was in 7th grade history class when we were doing a unit about ancient Egypt and Jews, and the word circumcision came up briefly. Had no idea what it was. Eventually someone told me that it's basically a Jewish ritual where they cut some skin off of your penis when you're a baby and my reaction was basically HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK!?! But then I calmed down, remembered each my parents are atheists, and figured I was safe. lol nope. Thing is, I'm a bit of a coomer, so I was bound to find out about foreskin eventually. I remember it was my 18th birthday, and on a whim I clicked on a video where some chick was giving some guy with foreskin a blowjob, and I kinda stopped and went wait a second what the fuck is going on here? So that's how I found out I'm circumcised. It really freaks me the fuck out, and I started watching tons of foreskin porn just because the curiosity was killing me, not because it was a turn on or anything. Eventually, that curiosity lead me to watch a video of a circumcision, and I noped the fuck out pretty quickly. I'm a purveyor of fucked up content from bestgore and r/MorbidReality, but circumcision videos are just a huge no. Suddenly, some of the, er, problems with my dick started making sense. Literally none of the skin on my dick can move, so erections feel so tight that they really hurt. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night because my nocturnal erections hurt so badly. I usually get what I call ""breakfast wood"" instead of morning wood, but it's still not fun waking up in the middle of the night twice a week because my dick hurts. I've heard guys talk about how sex feels so amazing, and I'm a virgin, but when I try cooming I barely feel a thing. I legit feel more when I rub my arm than when I rub my dick. I seriously feel no pleasure. I've spent so much time looking at foreskins and trying to imagine what it's like to have one that my reaction to seeing a circumcised penis is basically the same as if I lived in a world where circumcision never existed. I saw a picture of a male model the other day, and as a mostly straight guy I can no homo say that this guy had pretty much the perfect body, but then I looked at his dick and for a second I was just like WHAT HAPPENED?! So that's where I am. I change clothes and piss just like everyone else, and that's the worst part of my day. I don't even like looking or thinking about my dick because it instantly reminds me of circumcision videos and I just think ""hmm, that happened to me."" It just makes me want to commit Sudoku. I just feel SO uncomfortable with my body because of this. I'm terrified of my own penis.

Relationship with my parents is fucked. Said they did it for cosmetic reasons. So I dread my own penis, but at least my dad thinks my dick looks nicer than what he calls ""disgusting cheese dicks"", so I got that going for me. 🤡 If I could, I'd sue them and leave them penniless and homeless. This shithole is supposed to be the land of the free where I can do what I want, right? So why can't I sue them? What if what I want to be free to do is play with my foreskin? Fuck me, right? I used to think about killing myself and leaving a spiteful little suicide note to get back at them. I can imagine all the dumb faggots who'd show up to my funeral and it makes me sick. All the so called ""friends"" that cared about me oh so fucking much but never bothered to talk to me and who would most likely just laugh at me if I told them I was upset about circumcision. That's pretty much been my only experience when people find out that I hate being cut. I just can't stand looking at my parents, but at the same time I'm too much of a pussy to do anything. I tried to join the military because I hoped it would make me not such a sensitive faggot and make me feel like an adult and put my life on track, but I pussied out at the last minute because I'm scared of leaving home. Don't think I'm scared of leaving my parents as much as I'm scared of not having any familiar faces or having to leave my room. Plus, I have really bad pee shyness. Could barely piss at MEPs. Plus I'd have to see lots of uncircumcised penises at boot camp, and actually seeing them in person instead of just behind some monitor I think would drive me crazy. So I pussied out. So that leaves me here in the basement of a housed owned by a dad I hate and getting ready for college in fall, 2 years behind on life compared to my peers, depressed, own a car on the verge of breaking down, a fucked up circumcision that was probably done by a shaky handed medical student with cerebral palsy, working a job I hate, and possibly retarded. I started lifting years ago because I wanted to improve myself, but now I'm just buff and still a pussy.

I also want to mention that I'm a stupid hopeless romantic. I desperately crave some kind of intimacy. I like writing, and as you can guess most of my shit has at least a little romance. I think the last time I had any sort of compliment that wasn't from my mom was over a year ago when some girl I hadn't seen in months said I looked bigger and asked if I had been lifting. She was engaged, so it's not like she was flirty, but I felt so flattered. There's this one girl I started hanging out with in 3rd grade, but over time I started wanting something more. I told her I loved her when i was 12 but she didn't feel the same. I still talk with her on discord now and again. I get the feeling sometimes that after 7 years she's starting to come around, and I just can't get rid of these dumb feelings for her. She seriously feels like the perfect match. I've never met someone who was so much on my wavelength. I just wanna grab her by the shoulders, look her in the eye, and tell her I love her, but I'm too much of a pussy for something like that. Even if I somehow did manage to bag some poor, unfortunate lady, then what? My dick barely feels a thing and jerking off is more painful than pleasurable. Can't imagine sex would be any different with my fucked up dick. How would I satisfy myself? How would I satisfy her? Most people just laugh and don't get it when I say that I'm pretty mad about my fucked circumcision. I could form a whole ass relationship and fall for a girl only for her to laugh at me and say that she doesn't like ant-eaters anyway. Why even try? I don't even like the idea of sex that much because i can't stand the sight or thought of my dick. Wouldn't exactly call myself an incel because I'm attractive enough that I could get a meaningless one night stand that I'll regret if I wanted to. It's even though I crave sexual intimacy, my borderline sensationless dick that feels more pain than pleasure kinda stops me. I just want someone to hug me and tell me they love me. There's that old, meaningless adage ""it gets better."" I've been waiting for nine years for it to get better, and life has only gotten worse. Also still waiting for those spircumbision health benefits to kick in. Yeeting yourself in front of a train and dying a virgin decreases your chance of getting an STD from having unprotected sex by 100%. 🤡

TL;DR: Life is an RPG and I fucked up my built+Penis debuff. I don't want to play and don't know how to. I'm not having any fun. How do I log off? What do?"
Dealing with old friends and loss,"I dont really know what to say about this it's very fresh

About a decade ago my friends group began to break down and fall apart 

The four of us were very close me my best friend and his twin cousins that home was as close to mine as theirs for most of my teens until it wasnt

Long story short they started getting pretty far into drugs and all of us were dealing with worsening mental illness a few deaths in our families and the relationship declined pretty rapidly

After 10 years of introspection and a lot of hard work I'm married and a very different person than I was I still keep up with my yearly voyueristic look into what's going on with them tho

And I was blindsided with a news report from about a year ago of my ex? Best friend having beaten one of the cousins to death with a copper pipe over an argument

This at first was just a confusing event to me like I was reading about it with no relation to the people involved then it started to feel surreal 

I found out halfway home on the bus and by the time we got a few stops in I was in a full breakdown sobbing 

He looks like a ghost of the person I used to know in the mug shot

He was the smartest person I've ever had the pleasure of knowing, engaged and excited to talk about everything and anything

He also murdered one of the most outstanding likeable people I've ever met and left his twin brother alone for the rest of his life

I'm an insane mixture of grief confusion and anger at people I havent talked to in so so long

he's been in a mental facility for the better part of the last year and from the ongoing proceedings their is a decent chance hell end up there as incompetent to hold trial let alone go to jail for what he did so I dont know that the person I knew has been there for a while

I dont mind posting the news report if you're curious ill respond as long as I can today this has taken a lot out of me 

My wife thinks i should probably go to therapy to talk about this but it just seems foolish with how estranged we are at this point"
My mom almost died over the weekend,"My mom has been an alcoholic for 5+ years and she started drinking heavily on Thanksgiving. This past weekend she has been passed out and unresponsive. I had to leave the house, and when I got back, I found her car and a squad car parked in front of my house...
She had driven somewhere, and passed out as she was parking with 6x the legal limit of alcohol in her system. She almost died and was taken away in an ambulance. 
If she dies, I may go into the custody of my abusive father whom I am terrified of. 
I have no clue how to handle this or how to feel."
I knew it. I'm ugly and my brother said it straight to my face!,I knew it. He said it straight to my face. I went to tell my mom and she did nothing to help me. Not even my attractive sister and she was downstairs laughing along with my brother and a few people. I don't have anyone and I'm always thrown to the side alone. I'm done.
my boyfriend’s long list of exes is destroying me,"I know people do things they regret, and my [20F] bf [21M] was young when he dated the people he wished he never dated. But how do I come to terms with his past? I’ve never dated anyone before him, so sometimes I look at his dating experience and get jealous. Recently, I’ve been having nightmares about him cheating about me which I know deep down he would never do that to me. He loves me so much but it’s so hard to reciprocate due to my unsorted mental illness issues and insecurities. Sometimes, I get paranoia about someone from his past coming back. I get so sad about the idea of him doing NSFW things with people that weren’t me, and it makes me feel useless. Why can’t I just be okay with it? Does anyone relate to this? I am in so much pain over something that gave him so much suffering (tw: cutting) but my brain likes to manipulate the past and see myself as not good enough for him. I’m so pathetic."
Am I losing my friends?,I know I've been acting weird lately but I feel like my friends are becoming disinterested(?) in me. I don't talk as much anymore cus I've been feeling weird but they haven't noticed. Anyone have any wise words or know any genuine signs that they don't like me anymore?
I got mugged for the first time today.,"I was walking to meet with my gf, then we would go to school. I was going to the bus stop, when a man pulled a knife on me and said ""Give me your phone now"", so i gave my phone to him without hesitating, then he asked for my wallet (It was in my backpack) and I proceeded to take it, he got impacient and told me to give my backpack to him (with all my notebooks inside). Afterwards he told me to keep walking in the direction I was going, I was in shock, so I kept going to the bus stop, cause I wanted to tell my gf what had just happened. She met me in the bus stop, I was shaking, serious and worried. She spent the day with me and it helped me a lot, but I can't help feeling powerless and humiliated.  I lost my phone and all my stuff, I am having flashbacks about it and I don't know what to do. (English is not my first language, so feel free to correct my grammar).

(Update)

My friends and family have been giving a lot of support, I wasn't expecting this at all. My best friend visited me and we played a bunch of games to make me feel better. My girlfriend has been talking to me all the time and suggested I should go to a psychologist and her mother bought me a new phone (I'll be leaving this one in my house for a while). My aunt was desperate when she found out, she cried a lot and called me to ask me if I was fine.
My physics teacher and my math teacher were very worried about me. My school principal gave me some notebooks so I could easily come back to school. I think I am better now, I'm still afraid of walking in my neighborhood, specially near  the intersection where it happened. And finally, reading all the comments also helped me a lot, so thanks everyone, I think it's all coming together now (no meme intended)."
2008 - My and my son's year from hell - Getting it off my chest,"I want to write about the worst year of my life. Nobody has heard the full story, just bits and pieces.

&#x200B;

I feel like I've never recovered. I never had a friend to just say, ""You'll never guess what happened today,"" as each thing unfolded. That small thing would have helped so much. This is really, REALLY long and if anyone reads the whole thing, I will be VERY surprised (but grateful). (Honestly, I'm pretty new to Reddit, but I am guessing few posts on here are as long as this one.)

&#x200B;

I know many people have had far worse things happen, and I try to keep this all in perspective. It's not that I think this is terrible compared to some true horror stories I've heard, just that I never had someone to just say basically, ""You'll never guess what happened today.""

&#x200B;

So, this was in 2008 (hard to believe it is now 11 years ago, my life since then has been like a dream).

&#x200B;

In 2008:

&#x200B;

\+ My Mom died

\+ I split with my now ex-husband a couple of weeks later.

&#x200B;

Those are the highlights, but just the highlights.

&#x200B;

In January, my Mom died a gracious death. She was 80. It wasn't tragic in and of itself, given her age. But she was my Mom and the hub of the family. I worried greatly about my Dad. They had been married almost 60 years.

&#x200B;

My ex-husband said to me a week after her death, ""It's been a week. When are you going to stop being sad?"" (One week! 3 days after the funeral.) Due to a variety of factors (certainly not just that), I told him I wanted a divorce a few weeks after her death. He moved out 6 weeks after her death. I could have handled her death fine. (I would have been sad, but it would have been a good, clean sad.) But he was such a jerk about the whole thing and the miserable years that preceeded it haunted me such that every time I thought about my Mom, I thought about him. Every time I thought about him, I thought about my Mom. It was a lot.

&#x200B;

Two months after my Mom died, my son got into a car accident the same day my Dad was rushed to the hospital with heart trouble. My Dad was very fit. Doctors said he was as fit as most 40 year olds (golf, bowling, walked 2 miles 6 days a week, table tennis). But he had blockage of an artery, and we were all terrified that we would lose our Dad two months after losing our Mom. 

&#x200B;

While in the hospital, my brother and I apparently failed to send enough status updates to our oldest sister who got upset and sent an email in which she said, ""I don't know if you realize this, but my Mom just died...."" HER Mom. Not ""our Mom"". She's not my favorite person but I was upset when she almost died that year.

&#x200B;

My son had a girlfriend  that year, his first girlfriend who he really loved. Right around the same time, he found out she had been cheating on him with his best friend (since 3rd grade) and over 14 other guys. Due to his accident, he couldn't work at his job. He lost his step-Dad (only Dad he'd ever known), his Grandma (he was closer to her than I was), all the in-laws on step-Dad's side, his job, his girlfriend, and his best and one of only two guy friends. Not being able to work due to the injuries, he stopped driving in the car he'd purchased which he loved to do. (He wouldn't take money from me.). So, he sat in his room and played WOW, his life very suddenly changed. He became quite depressed very suddenly.

&#x200B;

When my son first found out, he didn't dump her immediately. Being an analytical person, he talked to her, tried to figure out her mindset and what was going on. They came and talked to me about all this (uncomfortably for me, but I'm glad they felt comfortable). She broke down and said she's been molested as a child and had known she needed help for a couple of years. It ended up that she asked me to beg her Mom to let her got to counselling. Her Mom wouldn't let her go! So, for 2 hours a night for at least 6 days, I agonized writing a letter to her parents. I have Asperger's and so being diplomatic is of course not my strong suit. I finished the letter, and both of them read and approved it, and the parents read it. The Mom said, ""If she needs someone to talk to, she can talk to me,"" which of course the poor girl didn't do, because her Mom was terrifying. I hate to say it, but pulling the strength in to try write that god damned letter in such a way to actually help that kid took all my strength with everything going on, and it did no good :-( I worked so hard on that letter. (I hear she's doing pretty good now, though!)

&#x200B;

Then someone broke into my son's car twice that year, the second time stealing everything (both times breaking a window). He wouldn't let me help. (He's very stubborn.)

&#x200B;

He had left a GPS, his ipod, and his phone in his car. He was normally very careful, but there had been a weird circumstance and he'd gotten knocked off his habit and left them. They were all stolen. He had paid for all this himself.

&#x200B;

I have three sisters. During that year, all three went to the hospital, near death. One was in intensive care at the same time my Mom was being moved to hospice. I could write 4 more paragraphs about what happened to them that year!

&#x200B;

Right at the beginning of the year, the 3rd oldest sister had just driven home with her husband and 6 kids (one 3yo and 2 4yos, one adopted) to an island off the east coast of the US and was actually almost home when she got the news about my Mom failing. This sister left the husband and oldest daughter and drove all the way back to Minnesota with the 5 kids (alone). She was completely exhausted and stressed when she arrived back in MN. 

&#x200B;

She home-schooled the youngest 3 and did NOT isolated them from other kids, so she was a very busy women every day. Very ""strong"". After my Mom died, after she drove back across the country to her home (with 5 kids!), she couldn't cope for the first time in her life. At one point, she told us she was talking to someone at her church and suddenly laid down in the hallway and started sobbing. I almost never saw her cry as a kid.

&#x200B;

So, I was worried about her, and was calling her frequently, trying to talk to her. Her husband was in the military. She was used to being almost a single Mom, but she really needed someone. Her husband worked maybe 60 hours per week. Then she almost died due to a stomach thing (I can't even remember what it was) later in the year.

&#x200B;

My brother's son has ADHD and Asperger's. He had been on medicine that gave him a twitch, so they took him off around when my Mom died. He started being unable to get himself to school. He'd wake up, shower, dress, then sit on the floor and say, ""I can't go. I just can't go."" It was maybe withdrawal from the medicine. The school called the authorities, and my brother and sister-in-law almost had to go to court. They were calling counsellors and doing everything they could, but we were afraid for a while for his sake and that they might be charged with a crime.

&#x200B;

My 2nd sister's boyfriend of 10 years was also a jerk after my mother died. A week after her death, my sister still had flowers from the funeral in her place. He told her she had to get rid of them because it made HIM feel too sad about my mother's death. My sister broke up with him. 

&#x200B;

Around that time, they had found out he had pancreatic cancer. We knew and loved him like a brother-in-law. My son knew him well. My sister broke up with him, but we didn't wish him any ill will. So, my sister got a message that he was ""nearing his end"" and wanted to ""spend his last days"" with his ex-wife. A bunch of things ensued and it turns out, he was completely cured, was NOT nearing the end of his life, and that he had been cheating on my sister with his ex-wife for the entire 10 years (with the ex-wife's knowledge). My sister had played cards with the woman! And this guy had been using my sister AND MY PARENTS for money and to fix his car the entire time. This altough my sister never made much and my Dad never made more than $12/hr in his life. (My Dad, in his 70s and 80s had fixed this guy's car for free \~3 times. The guy still owed my parents a couple of thousand dollars, which he never paid to this day.)

&#x200B;

Later in the year, I learned my son's now ex-girlfriend would not leave him alone. Called him all the time, had her friends contact him on FB (after he'd blockd her). He finally had had enough and threw a phone and I stepped in and called her Dad, but this was really hard on him. She called him again one last time and that time, he went a little crazy and said he'd kill himself if she didn't leave him alone. The girlfriend called 911 (as she should have), but I got a call at work saying my son had tried to kill himself. Worst moment of my life. 

&#x200B;

I'll never forget that feeling. He was fine. He was honestly just really pissed. But the terror I felt can not be explained. I should have helped him much earlier in dealing with that situation! Yet another thing to kick myself for that year of many failures on my part. The poor kid. I'm writing this as if this is MY bad year, but why it was my bad year was because it was an incredibly terrible year for all the people I love, and most of all I think of my son. And how I dealt with all of my inability to handle being so worried about him and everyone actually resulted in my doing something that harmed him more than anything, as you will read below!

&#x200B;

I had spoken with the my son and his girlfriend earlier in the year when my son found out what she'd been doing. They actually sat me down and said she'd been having sex with all these guys. I felt really not up to the task of this event!

&#x200B;

My son's car was broken into a third time. This time, the busted his back seat and broke his trunk lock and stole his subwoofer he had bought and did other damage. The car was totalled. (I might be getting some details mixed up. It was a crazy year and it was broken into three times in our driveway.)

&#x200B;

My soon-to-be-ex-husband's Grandma died that year. She was one of my favorite people. I adored her since I met her. I didn't go to the funeral since we were separated, but sent flowers, a hand-written card, and a couple hundred dollars. I wished I could have gone, but I knew it wouldn't be appropriate, of course. His family (who I adored) sent back a note that in flowery terms basically said, ""It's the way of the world that people part ways. We don't expect to hear from you again."" It made me sad. I wished I could have kept HIS family instead of my own when we divorced. My son called his parents Grandma and Grandpa, and he never got a chance to even say ""So long"". It was just ""Blurt!"" that's it, they are no longer part of your life, kid! No good-byes, no nothing for him.

&#x200B;

My now-ex-husband swore up and down he'd get a 2-bedroom place and set up a room for my son, and they'd still hang out. That never happened. (I didn't expect it. He was the step-Dad, but it was he who promised it over and over.) My son never knew his biological father and calls this guy ""Dad"" to this day. Ex-husband started doing urban exploration just after we split up. That year, he got my son to spend his own money on equipment (from his savings from his job), and would say they would go do something. Then the day after, he'd say to my son, ""Explored a great place. Here are pics,"" while my son had been waiting by the phone the day before for a call that he never got. Also, my ex hooked up with a women from his work who was 24 years old who he had previously tried to hook up with my son. We both found that creepy. (I was 41 at the time.)

&#x200B;

Got a call from my Dad later in the year at work in which he told me that after they had found lung cancer, he was going to go back in a week to find out more. The one and only time he called me at work. Well, his hearing was failing badly. It turned out that it was not lung cancer or anything concerning, but that scared me (and of course my Dad!) for a week.

&#x200B;

Towards the end of the year, I wasn't doing so good. AT the encouragement of my team lead at work, I started taking an anti-depressant. It was one that curbs appetite and I started not eating much, less than 1000 calories per day, and was not doing well with that.

&#x200B;

A new team lead came on who got my manager, product owner, and the team lead mentioned above fired. Got rid of all the contractors and half my team. I was terrified that I was next, so that was added worry.

&#x200B;

Due to not eating, the stress, and the worry about my family, I got into a very bad state. My son finally told me in December that he thought the medicine was really doing me harm. (He told me later that I was speaking very, very slowly and not making a lot of sense.) I had come to the same conclusion about the medicine and then I abruptly stopped taking it. Bad idea. I became suicidal. I tried to kill myself (not too hard) one night. It wasn't a cry for help, I was just too far gone to figure out a good way to do it. 

&#x200B;

I came to my senses a little in fear for my son and read some stuff online. (At that point, I was so far gone, I figured my son and everyone else I cared about but couldn't sooth was better off without me.) They said that people can't fix you, but you can ask for very specific help to alleviate stress. So, I called my brother and my ex-husband to my house and told my ex-husband that I needed him to do few specific things: 1) switch cars because we were driving each other's cars and I had already paid a fine because his tabs were expired and I'd also paid a parking ticket on MY car that he'd racked up, and 2) my husband to take his cats. 

&#x200B;

My ex tried to refuse to take his car pretending to be ""nice"", but he really just didn't want to be bothered to switch the stuff, so my son switched all the stuff and the keys (my son is an amazing person). My brother told me to take vitamin D.

&#x200B;

But I got crazier and made a much more serious attempt at killing myself a few days later. I ended up in the hospital. The good thing is that while there, they actually had me see a real doctor. He diagnosed me with Raynaud's and told me to come see him later. (When I did in January of next year, it turned out that although I had been taking vitamin D for 3 weeks by that point, that I was ""overtly deficient"").

&#x200B;

In the last part of that terrible year, I had also taken in my son's other friend who had been abused badly by his family. I talked to him for hours many days about his life and what his family had done. I took him to practice driving and took him for his driver's test. I got him set up to get his GED. (He had been kicked out of school 2 months before graduation for swearing a teacher.) I bought him supplies for his job. I took him to vote for the first time. (He was very serious about it and had done his research. I was proud.) I worried about him as much as my son. I actually considered adopting him, though he was legally an adult. In my head, I had taken him under my wing, even with all that was going on. I gave him chores, gave him restrictions and rules, tried to give him what little advice I could give.

&#x200B;

While I was in the worst state, my son asked me to kick his friend out, because the friend was bugging him a lot. My son saw this kid more as an annoying little brother than a friend. My son had actually said straight to my ""other son's"" face that he loved him on multiple occassions and also would say ""stop acting stupid"" in not so many words. My son is a sweetheart, but he was just a kid and just annoyed and didn't want this kid living with us anymore, though he loved my other son. Instead of trying to resolve the conflict, I agreed to kick my other son out. But he was, in my heart, my ""other son"". It hurt me to my core, but I was too out of it to figure out a solution. It was one of the things that made me so crazy at the end. I kept putting it off and putting it off and my son kept reminding me that I'd promised. I was so upset with myself for not being in the frame of mind to handle the situation.

&#x200B;

Epilogue: After the suicide attempt, early in 2009, I did kick my ""other son"" out. He sent me the kindest note in the world, thanking me and saying no one had ever cared about him like that, and he understood why I had asked him to leave. (I didn't deserve it, but I was grateful for the note.) He got his GED, got a job, finished a year of college, got some local fame and a city award as a rapper. But he died in 2012. He had moved out of a place with damage deposit for a new place, but being a sweetheart, he gave that money to a young woman he'd met who was trying to escape an abusive relationship so SHE could get a place. Unbeknownst to me, he then was camping out in some woods in our city for a week. At night while going to the store on his skateboard, he was hit and killed by a car. I will never forgive myself.

&#x200B;

In 2010, my Dad died. He died a horrible, horrible death (Lewy-body dementia, same thing that Robin Williams had).

&#x200B;

In 2015 my brother died, leaving two kids who were still dependent, being special needs kids. 

&#x200B;

In 2011, I had a guy I was seeing for a few months harrass me for over a year. 

&#x200B;

In 2011, I was physically assaulted and almost raped by a stranger. 

&#x200B;

In 2016, someone who had been my best friend from age 17 - 30 (and I considered my platonic soul mate) died in his late 40s. 

&#x200B;

Also in 2016, my son's very good friend killed himself. It was the fourth young person my son knew who had killed himself. I knew the kid well, also. My son will never be the same! All my ""years from hell"" compare not at all to what my son has been through these past years.

&#x200B;

Since that year from hell, all of my remaining aunts and uncles but one have died. The cat I inherited from my Dad (a feral alley cat he'd spent years gently taming) died. My son was far more devastated than I at her loss, because he was the one who got her fully to love us. First time she sat on someone's lap (when she was probably 12yo as per the vet), it was on my son's lap. He was her special human."
I feel like I’ve been an observer in my own life for years now,"Just finished a degree at university. Now it’s on to the big wife world and finding a job, finding a significant other, figuring out where I want to live and what I want to do with the rest of my life.

And I can’t help but feel like past me was careless and hopelessly optimistic about everything.

I just moved along through the last couple of years, I made acquaintances, but once I moved apartments everyone just kinda drifted away and I haven’t done anything to stop that.

Now I feel like I’ve been placed at the start of an open world game having just completed the tutorial, but I’m completely aimless. I went to school, I went to college, I pursued a degree in computer science, and now it’s as if everything before me is inaccessible because I haven’t had years of experience or contacts.

I’m not suicidal or anything, never really considered it an option, but it seems like everyone is supposed to have a goal, something they want. The only thing I want is not to be a burden. But I can’t seem to find a way to be fully independent.

I could go on and on, but I’ve rambled enough, and I think in the midst of that train wreck of thought is the gist of what I’m trying to say."
Sick online friend hasn't answered messages or calls for a day,"Friend that I've met online said that he had difficulty breathing 2 days ago due to his bad sickness (cold he said), he lives by himself and didn't apparently have any medicine either. 1 day ago he said it was still hard to breathe and the sickness was getting worse (one ear losing hearing).

It's been ~24 hours since he last sent a message after we exchanged good nights and such. I've tried to send messages, call (the call reached his device, but he didn't pick up) and a normal text message incase Signal (the app we use to communicate) has problems.

I'm super anxious and worry about him, he said he'd be fine but usually we exchange atleast couple messages a day so being silent is abnormal.

Update: He finally answered! He's been asleep for a whole day, and went to sleep again, he doesn't have energy to even get off bed.. I'm still very worried and will keep checks on him until he gets better. I'm relieved that he still lives."
I'm really really lonely,"I just feel very very alone. I have a friend who I am very close to. I love her like a sister. She claims to love me too. She also claims that I'm her best friend. But she never talks to me in person. Whenever we have an opportunity, she always prefers to talk to someone else.
She talks to me regularly through the phone though.
Despite having brought this up several times with her, and her saying that she will change, she never does.
I trust her a lot. But I feel so... Alone. I don't have anybody else in my life to talk to.

Thank you, whoever spent their valuable time reading this. "
Communication is so hard for me,"I seem to have anxiety or something because it is so hard for me to communicate my needs. In my brain my needs are always just ridiculous and I should just keep them to myself, so it takes me days to work up the courage to communicate something sort of important. Or if I get drunk then I will accidentally let things slip that I want to keep hidden because I think its just too crazy to talk about. 

For instance, for a long time I thought I didnt want kids, but now I do. My boyfriend and I had agreed early on that we weren't going to have kids, so I just kept my change in feelings locked away in my mind, and I was just going to try to move past it myself. Anyway about a week ago when we got drunk, I accidentally let it slip. And it turned out very good that I did because it forced me then to talk about it more with my boyfriend, and turns out hes not against having kids, so in a few years time, we are having kids. 

But even little things like asking if I can set up an aquarium or get a pet (not that I really need to ask, but I prefer to) causes my heart to race and my anxiety(?) to go through the roof. "
My kitten died this morning,"My cat got pregnant and had two kittens. One was going to live with my friend, and one we decided to keep. She was a runt, her spine was crooked and she was gray and white with a gray smiley joker face on her back, and was the sweetest thing. We named her Lucy-fur, and she was the only cat my fiancé liked. My kids adored her, I adored her, she was just the coolest kitten. After some initial concerns, she started to eat, she ran around and played, she was growing and seemed to be doing great. This morning my fiancé let me sleep in, he was in the living room with my daughters and heard this yowling sound. He walked into the kitchen and found Lucy laying on the ground yowling and breathing hard, he ran to wake me up and told me something was wrong with her. I sat with her for a second and went to grab a towel to wrap her in so we could rush her to the vet. I got back with the towel, laid it on the ground and she took her last breath. My fiancé and my five year old were crying, and I had to wake my son up to tell him. Her mom sat there and licked her for several minutes, trying to wake her up. 

She was only three months old. My fiancé just sat next to her, petting her and crying. I was sobbing, calling my mom to see if she had a box we could bury Lucy in. 

We buried her and planted wild flower seeds over her grave. My eight year old made a cross out of sticks, my son is the one who placed her in the ground. My other cat is acting lost, she keeps walking around meowing, like she's looking for her daughter. 

I know she was young, but we all really bonded with her. She loved to cuddle, always came running to you when you walked in the door, would sit on your foot and meow until you picked her up. Anyone who came over instantly fell in love with her. She made a huge impact in her short life, and there are five grieving people. 

Rest in peace, Lucy-Fur. You'll be missed. "
To have a standard 19 year old's problems would be such a blessing.,"I made a throwaway because I didn't want this on my normal account, but it doesn't even matter anymore. I was gonna write a really long post. I had it part of the way typed out, but then I realized: there's no way in hell I could possibly list everything that's wrong. I'm 19 and I don't live at home. All the problems a normal adult in poverty would have, I have. Someone kill me, cuz I can't do it myself. PM me if you care."
Tomorrow I go back to being alone and miserable,"I've been on a month long trip with friends, and it's been great, but tonight is our last night. They're all looking forward to returning to their family and partners, and I'm just dreading it. 

I live significantly further away than the rest, so can only see them once or twice a year, and my social life back home is non existent. I know I shouldn't be selfish, but my heart is legitimately breaking at the thought of having to go back to my normal life. "
Today's my 19th birthday and it kind of sucks.,"I try so hard not to whine but this sub is exactly what this is for, right? 

It's my birthday today and I am in college, state college so I still live at home which is good because it saves me money and my parents money too, because they are planning on getting divorced but can't afford to yet because neither of them can keep the house on their own. They tolerate each other for my sake but they aren't very nice to each other anymore and it sucks. 

They are taking me and a friend to dinner for my birthday tonight and I really don't want to go, but I can't say that. They have enough problems and an ungrateful kid is the last thing they need. 

Oh and the only guy I've ever loved, like truly loved, for over two years, has recently told me that he no longer wants to even be my friend. I met him the summer before HS started and basically had no interaction with any other guys until just recently and I've discovered that I don't know how to interact with other guys and that is pretty depressing too.

And lastly, I'm on this dating site and get lots of messages from guys just wanting to hook up but a few nice ones and then this morning, on my birthday I get an offer to make lots of money if I make a sex tape, give a guy oral or have sex with an old dude! Yay, my life has amounted to being solicited online for sex, which I've never had, so let's add that to the mix.

So yea, that's what's bothering me today. "
In love with my best friend and it's killing me,"I am so fucking in love with my best friend that it's mentally killing me. It's going on 2 years now and what's more is that he's the same sex as I am, straight and taken. I didn't ask to be gay. I didn't ask to like him. I wish I was as straight as an arrow because fuck that would make my life so much easier. 

We're in high school and seeing him is unavoidable considering I sit right next to him. I feel like killing myself. Would be so much easier than this. 

He hurts me a lot but that is to be expected for liking the same sex. He doesn't do it on purpose so I can't blame him for it or talk to him about this since he doesn't know about this thing I have for him. 

I try to find the bad things in him but he's always so considerate and kind and thinking bad about him makes me want to throw up. 

He's so beautiful it kills me. 
And I don't know what else to do. 

please help

I screwed up a friendship all by myself,"I'm a male, my best friend is a female. I've wanted to be more than friends with her for a long time, but I've been lying to myself and saying I don't, and I can't really do it anymore. I want to stop talking to her, because it reminds me of what's never going to happen (she doesn't feel the same way. I'm 100% sure.) but she deserves a better friend than that, and I don't want her to be sad. It sucks so hard. "
Not into anything anymore.,"I am losing interest in every hobby I pick up. I will completely drop one thinking I will come back to it later. ""maybe I just need something new and exciting!"" But that usually lasts for a month or two. It's beginning to be a habit of mine. I push so much stuff away, yet I keep around because I do want to finish it. So I feel like I am drowning with missions when I'm in my house. Whenever I try to pick one back up, my eyes get really heavy and I have a hard time staying awake. Sleeping has always been an issue for me though. All I want to do is sleep. When I'm not working, all I really do is sleep, besides waste time on the internet. I'm always hungry too."
My surgery didn't go as well as I hoped.,I had reconstructive surgery nearly a week ago and it doesn't look as good as i expected it to. Its like paying 15 grande for a permanent haircut that you hate.
I feel left out.,"Ever since I was little, I've been the kid that was left out of everything. I was the kid all of the family members have picked on.

Since then, I have grown a lot of confidence and changed my life dramatically, but for some reason, I feel the need to be ""special"" or the best at something in order for me to not feel left out.

What sparked this feeling yesterday when I had dance rehearsal for my dance team. We have a show this weekend and I have a set of best friends that I associate myself with. During the show, there is a solo that one of my best friends is choreographing for and he is allowed a couple of people to do it with. Out of the 4 of us, 1 being the choreographer, he chose the other 2 and not me. 

This makes me feel inadequate in my skills to perform and makes me think about my relationship with my best friend as I support him in everything he does. He even taught the piece last tuesday and I drove 45 min to support him while the other 2 didn't even show up. Thinking about it, he didn't even go to my graduation or really supports me in anyway. Feels like he just uses me to smoke.

I just sucks, and I hate feeling this way."
"I may look okay, but honestly, I'm not strong enough.","I really liked a guy and I know that it would have never worked because I'm not strong enough to be vulnerable without feeling weak. I may come off as this self-assured, loud and confident person, but deep down, I crave love and want someone to like me or just accept me unconditionally without me having to give and give and give until I have nothing left.
  
Then I end up like a dried out insect after a spider is done with it. Just some hollow fucking shell.  
  
Every time I show the vulnerable side. they back out, and I understand. Who would want me? A vulnerable sucker masquerading as a strong girl? I wish I wasn't so afraid.   
  
Maybe one day I'll meet a man who loves me like crazy... But being single is where I'm happiest. I'm too weird for anyone to handle. I'm just a bother. At least I keep myself entertained. Me and my left hand. "
I don't like college.,"I hate the culture. I don't drink, I'm not comfortable smoking here, and I don't like partying. My US school is a party school masquerading as a 'public Ivy'. I'm bored and it isn't challenging me the way everyone told me it would.

I miss my boyfriend. We're young and no one thinks we'll stay together except for us and a few close friends. I barely care what they think. I'm ready to settle in with him and live my life how I want to, finally, after years of living with the nagging voice of my parents in the back of my mind.

I want to go to the community college near my hometown, get an associate's, then transfer to the local public university. The price would be reasonable, rather than requiring $8000 of debt each year. The price of this semester alone e makes me nauseous when I think of it. I have better shit to do than throw money into a school I'm barely happy at. I want my life to be under my control but I'm still fucking scared of doing it."
"I wish that I were beautiful. I hate that I think mostly about dating, of girls, of sex, of love. I do not feel in control of myself.","I am afraid that I do not know what to write here. There is so much that I cannot even put into words, such that I find it over whelming at times. When I am happy, I am just alright. If everything is going smoothly then I everything is fine. 


Ultimately, I think that I do not know how to deal with all of the suffering in this world. I do not mean the suffering caused by war, famine, poverty. These things I am quite detached from because I live in a wealthy nation and they do not affect me in an direct way. I know that this is wrong because I do not think of myself as a citizen of my nation, but rather a human who must share this earth with everyone else. I know that we must all work together and help each other out.


No, my problems are so insignificant. But, are they? If my problems are so small, then why do I feel bad if they might affect the people around me. Sometimes I think that I have too much empathy. Sometimes I wish that I were completely alone so that I do not need to feel sadness at something lost or changed. I do not wish to feel happiness, because nothing is forever and I cannot fathom loss. I do not wish to feel sadness because it is loneliness and painful. I do not wish to see my family suffer. I do not wish to be relied upon for comfort, for happiness, for belonging. I do not know how to provide these kinds of things yet I long for companionship and understanding, for love and tenderness, for warmth.


I just want to be alone sometimes. I don't want anyone to think I do not want to be around them. I just don't know what to do about how I feel. Should I feel sadness? Yes, I do feel it and it scares me. I do not like when other people are sad, especially people that I care about.


I want peace I don't know where to find it. I don't want to complain about my feelings because I feel selfish. I am already too selfish. Why should I feel healthy, and look forward to a future when others in my family do not feel healthy. Why should I looks for happiness and companionship. Why should I look for a girlfriend or a wife when my grandmother is alone, and probably misses my grandfather. Why should I feel healthy and look forward to a future when my mother is tired, and exhausted from her disease.


I just want to drink. I just want to sleep. I don't want to feel anything. I don't want death but I don't want life.


I don't know what to do. I am selfish.


And then sometimes, the right song comes on and I think about running through a forest. I think of running through fields, towards castles and mountains. I think of love and carelessness. I think of future and of happiness. I think of a life that everyone should have, of health and prosperity, joy and adventure. And then I feel at peace for a short while. It doesn't last forever, because nothing could last forever. but these days it seems my only happiness is when I have these brief moments of escape. I just want to escape."
My nipples [Explanation inside],"I am a 17 year old male and I have extremely puffy nipples. I'm also a really skinny guy, so you can imagine how awkward it looks to see my little ronis poking through my shirt. They make me very self concious when I wear T-Shirts because you can see them through my shirt. I pretty much only wear hoodies and button-down shirts because of how self concious I am about them. It's honestly the only physical feature I have that embarasses me, and I can't fix it.

Yea, this seems extremely ridiculous and stupid compared to some of the stuff on this sub, but it's been bothering me for 3 years and I finally decided to rant about it."
My feelings are Invalid,"Everything was great. And then you had to go. And me being upset about you just wanting to be friends is foreign to everyone. Me wanting space to process losing you as a partner... I mean we were only together for a month but damn. I enjoyed you. I was falling for you. But you know, you can't actually fall for people. Not anymore. No one actually believes in soulmates, and you know what? I don't believe it either anymore. I'm tired of being patient for people to get their head out of their ass, and I'm tired of thinking I might have met someone worth while only to find out that they're not. 

Fuck. Love.
Fuck. Sex.
Fuck the need to have a partner.

You know? Because men are meant to fuck everything in sight. And humans are carnally are non- monogamous. If that's so then why do I have this desire?


I want to just fucking disappear. Because none of this is worth it. 

The only reason life is worth living is because I have a job obligation. And the hope that life will eventually be worth living.  "
My boyfriend just broke up with me,"I didn't think it'd hurt this much. 

Update: Hey thanks guys I really appreciate all the words and suggestions. I'll give a little bit of details. I'm 20 we were going out for a couple months and this was my first real relationship. I was really starting to like the guy. I've been very upset about the whole thing because I'm so new to this. He said that he realized we didn't have as much in common as he originally thought... :/ "
i dont want to fail at life,"i graduated from a good college had fun, moved back home and been working shit jobs this past year to figure things out. i have a science degree gpa isnt very good about 3.0 and 2.7 sci gpa. i coasted thru school and unmotivated. i work shitty jobs and see people my age or older working at shitty retail. i see a 50 year old working at retail store getting paid 9 dollars a hour and having to work there to survive. people are stuck there, they cant just drop like i can. im scared to end up like that, how people disrespect u not treating u as an equal. also just being okay of living such a boring existence.i quit that job and now work at a hospital getting paid double, but still same thing not what i want to do with my life. after some reflection i wanna go to dental school, so gonna go do a post bac and get my grades up. i wish i worked harder in school, but now i have a strong drive to work hard in school get good grades. im scared tho that i suck, cant get good grades, that im incapable of it. i cant continue to waste my years living like this. i need to challenge myself, i would absolutely hate myself if i look back working a shit job all because i was lazy, miserable with my life..."
My boyfriend is distant towards me,"A couple of weeks ago my boyfriend of 3 years became really depressed and insecure about our relationship. He felt like that his reasons for being with me in the first place were bad and thought it was a bad decision. In short, he told me he got together with me because he didn't want to feel lonely. Okay, initially, that would be a bad reason to get together with someone, but it doesn't necessarily make it a bad decision altogether. At least, I don't think so. We've been together for 3 years and neither of us have had any fights, quarrels, or what have you. We've had arguments and disagreements like every other couple but we've always managed to work through them. He has done absolutely nothing to make me reconsider the relationship. His main concern was ""If you make a good decision for bad reasons, is it still a good decision?""

I think we all have shitty reasons for good decisions. When I was in high school they offered Juniors and Seniors a concurrent program where you can take college classes for both high school and college credit. Since these classes allowed for me to get out of school almost an hour earlier than high school, I went for it. I didn't even care much for the benefits it would offer me down the line, I just didn't want to be stuck in school until 3:35. As it turns out, not only did this allow for me to get college credit two years earlier than most, I got all of my basics out of the way when it came time to go to college as a full-time student. I also had several scholarships to that same Community College... so ultimately, it didn't even *matter* what my reasons were for going for that program in the first place. That program helped me establish what I really wanted to study.

Another part of it was that he felt that he wasn't good enough for me; that I deserve better, and that our relationship wasn't going anywhere... honestly, I'd only have an issue with the latter if neither of us were in college and we both had jobs and were living together. But for the time being, there's a good reason why our relationship doesn't go anywhere, and it's because neither of us have jobs that allow for us to live together yet, and we're both still in college studying. There's no need to rush into something more when you have important goals to accomplish first. His concern with this was that he thought I wasn't happy about it... but I'm just fine. I can wait until one of us graduates and/or gets a good enough job for us to be able to live together. Again, rushing into moving your relationship forward will cause undue stress.

As for the former... well... I feel like with that logic, I can't find anyone better. He has described me as the nicest person that he knows and he can't even remember a time when I made him mad. I feel the same way about him too. I don't think he really gets that in order to be with someone you have to expect some flaws. Don't settle for complete assholes that don't make you happy, of course, but at least make sure the awesome things about someone outweigh their flaws.

In any case, I managed to have a good long talk with him about it, and even spent a couple of days with him afterward. He was happy. I was happy. We were both happy. Until now.

Now it's happening again, He's getting very distant towards me, and any attempts and reassurances to him about how he can talk to me about any problems have resulted in him saying either a ""No"" or a ""k"" depending on what I say to him. Now today, he's finally told him to leave him be for a bit. I guess it is for the best, and I will give him the space he needs, but given that this is the first time he's explicitly told me to leave him alone gives me a bad feeling of what's to come next. I want whatever problems there are to be solved or at least talked about as soon as possible. I don't want us to split and wind up ruining what we've got, but if that's what he wants to do, then I don't have a choice in the matter.

EDIT: He finally opened up to me last night. As it turns out, he's felt like that I've been blowing him off as of late (Work as given me more hours, I've been hanging out with some friends, and I've also started volunteering at a Cat Shelter recently,) and that we weren't as close as we have been before. He thinks us going on a date would help bring us closer, so we're going on an adventure this Saturday. :) Thanks for your kind words, I really do appreciate it."
I'm not sure if my reaction to someone's death is appropriate.,"Hey everyone... so this might seem a bit odd, but I'll try to keep it short-ish.

Anyways, on my regular account, I am subbed to /r/gamegrumps (if you don't know, Game Grumps is a youtube channel of people who play video games and make videos of them playing.) 

A little over a week ago someone made a post on the /r/gamegrumps about how he has cancer and he was glad for all of the joy watching the show gave him. Earlier today he made a second post, mentioning that he is currently in the hospital and doctors say he won't make it past Friday. 

And that's where the problem starts... since I read that earlier today, I have been a wreck. I've been crying off and on all day whenever I think about it. I've gone through an entire box of tissues.

All because of the impending death of one person, who I've never met before, who I've never heard of before a little over a week ago, and who I've had no direct contact. I can't help but wonder if my reaction is too extreme for the circumstances, or what I should do about it. I can't really ask anyone I know because it sounds ridiculous. "
I'm fucked,"AMA.  I need to be an open book because keeping things inside have ruined my opportunities, relationships, and life in general.

Long story short, I've been depressed and had suicidal thoughts for over a year, flunked out of one school and about to be on probation on the one I'm at now.  I handled depression terribly, not even going to see a doctor for the first 9-10 months or so, despite my ex's encouragement.  I went from 3.8 GPA in highschool to getting kicked out in one year, and that kinda blindsided my parents.  The feeling of disappointment pretty much killed me for the next 3 months.  Now I'm going to have to feel that way again, as well as they probably won't let me try to fix things next semester.  If so, I can't blame them.  Nobody but me would fuck up two semesters the way I did.

I don't know why I stopped seeing the doctor.  I guess when my mom said she thought I was feeling better I felt it would make her happy if I said I was rather than disappointing her, even though that way I might have been able to deal with it.  

Might as well add some more shit to this.

-Have one friend who lives near me I talk to occasionally, a couple others I only play online games with.

-Only dated one person ever, pretty clueless and have nothing to offer in a relationship.  (Of course when I fucked things up so badly this is currently the least of my concerns)

-Honestly I don't even know how to make conversation with people, even my friend who I used to talk with for hours.  I quite often go an entire day without using my voice.

-No ambition to do anything.  The only thing I do is distract myself with shows and games so that I'm not thinking about wanting to die or something.  My mind races so I spend pretty much every waking moment avoiding real life.  This is an absolutely terrible lifestyle, but I guess I just took the easiest way out.

-I was an entirely different person two years ago.  I used to have hobbies and do well in school, and I used to be a human being.  People knew who I was, and I enjoyed life.  That's something I can't really say anymore.

-The last time I was overall happy was over a year ago.  The end of last march I went on a vacation with friends and my then gf.  The day after when I returned to school was the turning point where everything went downhill.  

I got carried away, probably should have left details for any questions anyone had.  

Feel free to ask anything

I want to go back to a doctor and try therapy this time

Otherwise I don't know what to do.

I want to try again, like go back to graduation and this time I could handle it better.  Or maybe just get in the car and drive away.  That would be better than offing myself but still hard on my mother, besides, I'd be just as fucked wherever I went.


e:  Thank you everyone who has helped with this, your contributions are greatly appreciated.
e2:  I think I might be able to break from this problem in some time.  There's still the big issue of school and my parents, but I think if that goes relatively well (they let me go back to school) I can break free from these issues with the help of a therapist and self improvement.  I think I'm ready to turn this around; it's just that I hope I didn't already ruin that opportunity.

Thank you guys so much."
My mom keeps posting obnoxious Boston oriented things on Facebook...,"She grew up in Medford, which is Boston adjacent but not part of Boston. She never lived in Boston, and she moved away from being Boston adjacent over 30 years ago

I suck at everything,I seem to have no talent at all and haven't accomplished anything.  The sports I play are the best example I put as much effort or more than anyone else and in return I get mediocre results.  I'm really competitive but whatever I put my time into I am just not good at.  This is crushing my sense of self worth and I just feel like nothing matters since im shit at everything.
I'm that guy in the group of friends,"The one who gets dissed and made fun of consistently. It's clear I'm not respected as much as the others. It bugs me a good amount and makes me feel like I'm not on the same level as the rest of them. 

The most obvious answer is to get a new group of friends, which I have done and have started to hang out with more and more. However, the group I live with currently is the same group that makes me feel shitty. I can't move out for another year and half due to signing my name on a contract. 

It really pisses me off that they continue to look down on me. "
I hate having to lie to my parents.,"So I am gay, and I've only recently started coming out to a few friends. However, coming out to my parents is something I feel horrified to even think about. Not that they're against homosexuality; quite the opposite, they *say* they wouldn't care if me or my sister turned out to be homosexual.

However I feel like coming out to them would be a tremendous let-down for them. They always say things like ""You can do that to your wife…"" (not anything horrible), ""when you get a girlfriend…"", or ""when you have kids…"" etc. Well they have caught on that I have never had a girlfriend, and I'm 18. A couple of times they have explicitly asked me if I like women and I have to say ""of course!"" while I cringe inside, knowing that it will push back the opportunity to come out to them by a lot.

I now feel more open talking about my sexuality to friends or even people I don't know, but I can't bear the thought of telling my parents that I'm gay."
Work has screwed me over.,"Every year at my job, we have employee reviews, which bring up the opportunity for a raise.  Generally, the raises have been about 6%, depending on performance.  This last year, I have busted my tail.  I have completely got everything I was responsible for up to standard (the gal I had replaced left things in shambles, hence why I replaced her).  From there, and on my own time, I studied the business.  I learned everything I could, and continued learning.  I was asked to change shifts, because they needed someone good to take over.  I was asked to learn, and administrate, in the software.  I was asked to write and revise our processes.  All these things not in my job description.  All of these things extra.  And now, with two supervisors leaving the company at the same time, I am literally the only one who knows this software in the team of 8.  I had my annual review today.  My boss sang my praises.  My boss's boss sang my praises.  They didn't have a bad thing to say about me, and not a thing for me to improve on.  Then came the bad part.  My boss, who has given me special treatment for all I do, told me he fought upper management hard for a huge raise, but they basically blew him off, and I was offered a 3% raise.  Freaking $.42.  Let's see how much longer I'm there, then. "
Just found out the girl I've been seeing has a boyfriend.,"In the last couple of weeks I've been seen this girl. Over the course of the time we've known each other: we've been texting a lot, phone-calls, been on walks together and she has even come over to give me home-made dessert! Though we haven't kissed, (I believe) there is a mutual feeling towards each other, a lot more than friendship.

However one of my friends who currently lives with her, told me that she had a long-distance boyfriend when we were drinking with each other. He assumed I knew already, but I genuinely thought he was joking around. Me and this girl have had some very intimate conversation and she hasn't mentioned him whatsoever. My friend mentioned that they may have had a a bad patch recently, but he wasn't sure.

So I'm not sure what I should particularly do? Do I ask her straight if she has a boyfriend? Should I find out first that she think of me in a way more than just friends? Or should I just wait and see what happens?

Any suggestions? And many thanks for reading. Its just nice to get it off my chest!"
I can't stop thinking about some old explicit text exchanges I found between my GF and another guy,"Sorry for the throwaway. I think I just need some of you guys to slap some sense into me.

A few months ago I was concerned that my GF of two years was lying to me about something. Turns out she was. It wasn't a huge deal, and we've discussed it and since worked everything out. Thing is, to FIND this ""truth,"" I did some snooping. I'm not proud of myself, but I looked through her phone.

In addition to what I discovered, I ALSO discovered a number of old texts between her and a former fling. Now I KNOW these were before me, so really I have no reason to be upset. But they were sexually explicit. And in some ways, they were more sexually explicit than any exchanges that have ever occurred between her and me. She seemed more aggressive, less inhibited. 

We love each other very much and know she's the one, I just can't stop thinking about what I read. And to top it off, she's still kind of friends with this guy. They don't talk or anything, but he still comes around when a bunch of other friends do.... and while I openly know they ""dated"" (or whatever), she obviously has no idea I know about their exchanges - or any details of their sex life. It's driving me crazy!"
"Is 17 years old too young to date a 22 year old? Is this a moral issue, a legal issue, what? So confused","A 17 y/o is showing interest in me but I'm 22. If she was 2 years older she'd be a good match. I'm just wondering if 17 is too young ? I don't think 5 years difference is a lot (think 20 y/o and 25 y/o). 

This is seriously really bothering me :("
I'm under so much emotional stress.,"I'm 16, I just started a new job, I was suspended from school and I have to go to court because I was scared for myself and ended up getting arrested. Meeting with a lawyer, school hearing, and my job are conflicting with each other. I met a sweet girl and she makes me so happy but I fucked up when we got on a certain subject and I told her a story that sorta shocked her and she later texted me that she thinks she doesn't want to date anybody at the moment but she really likes me. My dad and his girlfriend are constantly fighting whenever I visit him.

I've been having cluster headaches. I'm going to have a fucking aneurism. And don't ask why I got arrested, just help me from having a mental breakdown."

"I'm failing my classes, I'm depressed, and my girlfriend of almost two years wants to take a break for a month or two while I figure my stuff out.","My girlfriend and I had been in a long distance relationship for about a year after she had to take a break from college, then she came back to my university and stayed with me over the summer.  It was fantastic.  Then the semester started, and everything started slowly going downhill.  I'm in my junior year, the classes are so much harder now.  I've never really had to study before, and I don't know where to even begin.  My best friend had to go to a different school due to personal issues, and another good friend of mine stopped talking to me almost altogether.  I just began to feel stretched really thin.  I didn't have time for anything, no matter what I did I couldn't find time for anything.  This started to affect my girlfriend, who cannot afford to do bad in her classes this semester.  She told me several times that she was worried about me and she didn't like my attitude towards school.  I didn't listen, I kept getting angry about the stupidest things.  Slowly it was like we were going through the motions, even though we both love each other immensely.  And finally, last Monday she told me she couldn't handle it anymore and that if I kept going the way I was going, she would leave me.  So she said for us to take a break until the end of the semester.  I'm so miserable and lonely right now, I don't know what to do.  During the past few months I slowly alienated most of my friends, they all said I was acting weird.  In the past week I've been working really hard to try and fix myself, rebuilding broken bridges and all that, and trying to focus harder on schoolwork.  That's the hardest part, because I'm constantly terrified that she won't take me back.  She said she lost her attraction towards me, and I'm going to have to work to rebuild it.  I'm trying really hard and I can feel progress being made, but...I just keep breaking down and I'm so scared.  I hurt her and it's killing me.  I used to self harm a lot too, hitting myself.  I haven't done that in a while and I'm scared I might start that up.  I'm scared I might start drinking a lot to cover up the pain.  I'm scared that if she does leave me, I'll hurt myself on an impulse decision and I won't be able to fix it.  I'm a broken man right now and I don't know what to do. 

Edit:  she is willing to work with me though, we're going out on a date next weekend."
"I hate taking my pills, but I hate being off them.","I'm bipolar and so freaking manic right now and all I want to do is sit down and play a game of chess, but no. I can't even remember why I'm not on my meds anymore but I'm really scared to get them back because that will mean admitting to all the people who think I'm faring so well that I'm failing. Failing, failing, failing, and none of it is being helped by the struggle I'm having here at school (I don't even want to be here any more) or the recent rejection I suffered that was timed just perfectly to match up with my last (and most devastating) ex's re-entry into my life. I can't talk to anyone about this, even my other bipolar friend. I hate so much right now and it fucking hurts. and tomorrow it's just as likely that I'll keep hating everything as I'll stay in bed all day because I don't have the spirit to get up. As I said, manic. Sorry all."
I think I'm depressed with an eating disorder and when I tried to get help no one believed me,"I used a throwaway for this :) I'm sixteen by the way.

I've been feeling shitty for a long time, as in a few years. To cope with the feeling of shittiness, I started an unhealthy obsession with my weight - I thought I would finally feel okay again when I was skinny. I tried exercising, but I was always really tired and never really had the energy (I know I sound incredibly lazy). The scale never really moved. So then I started eating less - at first it was just breakfast but eventually turned to lunch too. The pounds started dropping off and I got almost high off of seeing the number drop lower and lower. The problem is I have incredibly little self-control, and after eating minimally (under 300 cal/day) for a few days, I usually break down and eat. A lot. Usually 3000 - 5000 calories in the span of an hour and a half. Usually while I'm doing this though, I don't really register what's going on - it's hard to explain but basically one minute I'll be eating an apple and then an hour later I'm surrounded by empty food cartons with no real memory of eating them. Then I cry for about an hour and then, to make up for all the calories I ate, I don't eat (or eat extremely low cal, like 200 or less) for two-three days, depending on how bad the binge was. Then the cycle continues because I just get hungry again and on and on.

Obviously this isn't the most conducive to weight loss so I'm not exactly skin and bones (a lot more skin than bones really). I don't look like a person with an eating disorder, and I don't know if I really act like one, either (I don't eat extremely low cal every day, and I never really make myself throw up because I don't really have a gag reflex. I don't do this all the time, either; it's kind of in waves, where I'll eat somewhat normally for a few weeks before it comes back worse than before). Anyway, in the spring I was really fed up of always feeling worthless and shitty all the time so I worked up the courage to write my mom a letter talking about everything. She talked to me about it and basically said, ""Anyone can see you have issues with eating, but that's really normal at your age. Everyone does that because everyone has low self-esteem; when you're older, you'll stop."" She insinuated that I was making it up or exaggerating it for attention (I eventually just said I was exaggerating, which I know is incredibly stupid, because she kept making me feel awful by making jokes about it and I just wanted her to never bring it up again and, so far, she hasn't). 

Then I went to the school guidance counselor, who looked way in over his head before eventually calling in another counselor, who told me I had a serious problem and that they would get me help. They never said anything to me again after that, though, even when I went back in to follow up with them.

So, as a last resort, I went to free counseling at my church. The guy just told me I was sinning and that I would get better if I just prayed more. I was pretty angry because, obviously, if that worked I wouldn't still be feeling like this years later. Then he said I didn't really have it all that bad and there were people who had it way worse than I did, so why did I think it was okay for me to feel like this? This really upset me because I know there's not really a reason why I feel so empty all the time, which just makes it worse because then I feel like a shit person.

This all happened a while ago so I don't know why it's making me feel so upset now. I just really want to feel okay again but I don't know if it's possible anymore. I guess what's really bothering me is no one seems to think this is an issue, so why does it make me feel so awful all the time? Sorry for the crazy long post I guess I just needed to rant a little :)"
I Looked,"I wanted to send a twitter reply to a food trailer today to say thank you and their suggested item was delicious.  Low and behold your name pops up in my feed.  But I'm not following you and you're feed is protected.  You must have unprotected it and it shows up in my list still, which is weird.  (Good job Tweetdeck, lists of people you don't follow and don't follow you?)

So, no big deal.  I've been okay lately.  I miss some of the links you post about news and the cartoons you drew so I start poking around.

And that's when I see the Tumblr post to him saying you could just spend hours staring at his face.

3 months ago you were saying the same things to me.  Why did I have to look?  I feel like Pipen.  Why do I always have to look?

So, that's the closure I needed.  It sucks, my day is shot now, but I think it'll be easier for me.  I'd been holding onto something and now I know I was holding onto the past and it's time to look forward to what else is waiting for me.

Still doesn't take the hurt away, but it's something."
My SO...,"Let me explain. I like her. A lot. She's amazing, kind, beautiful, all that. She's wonderful. But, she recently had an experience where a guy would blackmail her. He said he loved her, he was depressed, claimed she was the only one who could help him. This went on, she got depressed. She cuts now. And MY darling thinks she's doing something similar to me. She doesn't believe me when i compliment her.
**EDIT: Hey guys, here's whats going on. I'm done listening to other people, she's my girl, we'll keep our relationship to ourselves, do what we think is right, and we'll sure as hell not break up because other people tell us to.**"
Sick of my social anxiety and fear of public speaking,"I'm 35 FUCKING years old and still have a problem introducing myself in a group. Heart races, voice cracks, and I fumble words. 

I have a 5 minute presentation at work next week and it's like a dark cloud over my head. I plan on over-preparing to help, but who knows if it will work. 

Fucking sick of it..."
I'm unattractive.,"I'm ugly. My girlfriend tells me I'm attractive and sometimes I convince myself that she's not lying but I'm really not. I know there is more to life than being attractive but it is all I ever think about. I'm young, I have a good body and I make an effort to look good yet I still hate the way my face looks. I don't know how to accept how I look."
I'm not worth anybody's time,"It's to the point where I'm not even that sad coming to this conclusion. I feel like my whole life has been a culmination of events that have slowly guided me to feeling this way. 

At parties or social gatherings, I can come off as a happy and easy-going, and sometimes, I might genuinely feel like those things too. But so often, those feelings would dissipate quickly and I would feel down and out. 

For example: Yesterday, I went to a club with some of my friends, met two random girls at a bar and asked them if they wanted to come with me to the club. They agreed and for about half an hour or so, I was hanging out, dancing, having a good time with them and then they just flat-out ditch me to go chill with some other guys. At first, I didn't mind. They were still just strangers to me regardless of how much fun I thought I was having with them. But then I started thinking more into, something I do too often that I shouldn't do, and I just kept thinking and thinking about how I'm really not worth anybody's time. I let things snowball and I can give you an extensive list of life events that I could use to support this claim. I know I shouldn't use this superficial outing to let me down but it's something that I just do out of habit (I promise I'm trying to work on it).

I believe in the idea of true love and things like, but not for myself. Never for myself. I'm not even sure if I want to be with anybody but if I ever truly do, it'd be pointless. I'm not worth the time. I understand that people like confidence, and I do my best to go out there and be confident. In the end, it's all fake. The smile that I put in my face and the energy I devote to being a happy overall person, it's all in vain. None of it is genuine, because at the end of the day, I just feel empty, that nobody should bother with me.

I don't mean to come off as a whiny kid. I do have friends and family that I know care for me and have told me that they enjoy my company. It's just that too often, I breath a heavy sigh. My face feels heavy and I walk with either my head down or just looking away from people. 

I wish I could articulate all this better, but it's hard to go back and edit through things like this. I just want to say that I don't feel like this all the times. There are days where I feel like life's great and that I am somebody that matters to both myself and others. It's just that I feel like I'm caught in a cycle of whatever they hell this is."
I'm introverted and my wife is not.,"Lately I'm more-or-less constantly exposed to in-laws who are various levels of taxing, and a friend of my wife's is also staying at our place along with her eight-year-old son this week on vacation from out of town.

I want to lock myself in my bedroom until everyone goes away for at least two days until I remember where solitude intersects with loneliness.

My wife doesn't understand why, and thinks I'm being an asshole for no reason. We're all of us driving to my mother-in-law's for dinner right now (I wasn't consulted during the planning phase of this).

Nobody's starving or on drugs or stealing from me or jeopardizing my career or marriage or setting things on fire or anything, but this bothers me."
I don't know how to tell one of my best friends that I really like her,We share a lot of mutual friends and no one knows that I like her.. I'm too shy to say anything and scared of being shut down.
Flashbacks about a girl are messing with my head,"Not really sure where to start.

Long story short, we started out a bit physical, then she wanted to just be friends, while I didn't. She dated other guys for awhile while I stuck around, but that just make me angry and self-loathing. After about 9 months of that, I tell her we have to stop seeing eachother so much. We both get over the initial separation, and life goes on. A couple months later, I text her again. We get flirty, one thing leads to another, and she ends up cheating on her (douchebag) boyfriend with me, to a certain degree.

We're basically back to not-talking again. I can accept all of that, but what's bothering me now is all the emotional bullshit that comes from remembering everything that happened between us.

Remembering the good stuff, like when we kissed, or hung out just the two of us, and spontaniously drove to wherever in the middle of the night is great, but once I snap back to reality, I still miss her. Then sometimes I remember the bad stuff, like when I figure out stuff that she's lied to me about to make herself look better, or like when she tells me about who she started dating, or how he didn't give a shit when she had a kidney stone, or when she would tell me about getting drunk at a party and do some really stupid stuff, or when she enabled another guy to cheat on his girlfriend with her, when she knew full well about both of them. I recognize this wishy-washy, enabling behavior, and I get mad that she can't recognize the hard she's doing to herself and others.

Sometimes I feel like I should be around and trying to protect her from herself and others, because I really do care, and the rest of the time, I know I need to stay away because she's just a drug for me. Something brief and fun in the moment, but followed by guilt, regret, and misery.

Anyway, that's what's bothering me today. Hope you all are doing well."
Trivial girl problems,"I have this thing that has been nagging in the back of my mind since the beginning of the summer.  

I've known this girl for a couple of years now and we are good friends.  I have never really seen her as a friend until she got off a bad relationship and I was by her side from the fallout.  We would have talks and such and I really think we had our ""moments"".  My feelings got the best of me and I started liking her and would think she would feel the same way.  Well flash forward to this summer and she starts dating another guy.  I don't know if I should tell her I had these feelings for her while she is dating this guy as I would be considered a home wrecker.  A part of me wants to tell her how I feel but another part tells me to not do it.  However, if I don't tell her then I will loathe myself for not getting my feelings out.  It's just weird and I haven't talked to her in a month since then.  Sorry for the paragraph"
Brother comes home drunk every night,"My brother is 18, and every night he comes home drunk and he'll go into my mom's room and sometimes when he's sober he'll do this joke where he pretends to get into her bed but when he's drunk he's dead serious. My mom makes him stop but he doesn't. Everytime this escalates, and leaves my mom, or this time in particular, him and my mom in tears. My brother also smokes (weed) on the daily, I really worry about him. Obviously this is a problem bigger just than how I feel, but I'm just really worried about my brother as he's going off to college in two months"

Stuff that's been bothering me for a while now,"(This is my first and only post i will make on Reddit, since my vpn subscription ends in 8 days and reddit is blocked in Indonesia. So i taught id finally let go of the bottled up emptiness here, because i have no where else to say all this.) 

So ive been really bothered by some stuff for quite a long time now, but ive never found anyone to talk to it about. So today for some reason ive decided that i need a place to vent all this stuff without serious consequence. Now to the actual problems im facing. 

I cant exactly say when it started, and I know its going to sound cliche, but lately i feel like I have a big empty hole in my chest. Its not exactly sadness im feeling nor depression, its more like feeling nothing. Its like I always feel empty even though im laughing and being around others. And I do have friends, lots of them actually. Id consider myself a pretty popular guy at school who's liked by a majority of the students. But then id come home and realize that they're not really friends with me, the way I act at school and at home is very different. At school im usually the upbeat guy who makes a few quips here and there to make people laugh, and id say academically im among the highest in my class. But at home im always very quite, never really talk much with my parents nor my family (for reasons ill get into later). And this duality in the way I act has really been eating away at my mind, because i know that the front I put up at school is a facade, and its fucking tiring to always be that guy. But if i do stop wearing that mask I know my friends will all abandon me. So id always feel empty and lonely every night. and at night its the worst because id always see my friends playing together on discord and asking me to join them but i cant because of home life (which ill get into in a bit). I guess that explains my knack for telling self deprecating ""jokes"".

So my home life, i wouldn't say that i come from an abusive household, no nothing close to that. But its a sudden realization that i just had that has really been hitting me on the head like a truckload of bricks. My dad is prone to anger outbursts, not at me but at my mom. And i used to hate him for that, but as time went on we got closer and i began to understand why he acts the way he does now (rough childhood). But that in my head doesn't excuse him for acting out against my mom for the stupidest of reasons (like if she was looking at her phone for too long, or attending her dance classes). As time went on though, i realized that my mom isn't an angel either. She has a shopping problem, she for some goddamn reason just cant stop buying shit that wont get used. And this is the root cause of my dad's constant anger towards her (if you saw all the bags in the guests room you'd be pretty fucking mad too). ive always grown up believing that my mom was right and my dad was wrong, but now i dont see that anymore. I used to believe that I would someday end the fighting between the two of them but that's impossible. My dad will never stop behaving like that towards my mother if she cant stop herself from buying useless shit for a month. Its this realization that's been eating out my soul, its like someone took my worldview and shattered it right in front of me with a comical smile on their face.

Then there's my extended family. Mainly my aunt, uncle, and cousins form my mother's side. they are the ideal perfect family cliche. smart children, successful parents, and they all love each other. Just seeing that intimidates me, and its not their fault. Id say Im close with these people, they've known me since childbirth and have treated me like on their own whenever i spend the holidays with them, but they don't understand who i actually am. I cant act like myself with them because they always expect me to be more like my cousins, more civilized. the last time i went there I saw my aunt and cousins going through their plans for college, and that's when it hit me, these guys think Im that upbeat person from school, the ""academically gifted smiley boy"" from school. And i hate being praised for being smart, because every time im around my family they always expect me to go to all these big universities and apply for all these things for college credit. I hate it, its filling my head with nonsensical stress and pressure that i cant vent to anyone about. I cant be myself around my family, I cant be myself at school, and i don't have anyone to be myself to anywhere. Basically where im at now, it feels like brick after brick to my head in the shortest time span possible with nothing to grasp onto. 

(For anyone worried i ruled suicide out as an option, its not worth it since ill only be causing more pain to those who care about me, but goddamn it feels like shit continuing to live like this.)"
Struggling with abusive parents.,"Struggling with abusive parents.

Very long post ahead. 

This is my first post in here, but I honestly feel like I’m going crazy in this quarantine with my parents. I mean I feel like they’re abusive but what if I’m just the issue here? I don’t know. My mother threw my meds on the table, her dogs got them off the table and chewed up the bottle, so she in turn threw the bottle into a fucking cup of diet coke and I was unable to salvage any pills, and now after tomorrow I have no meds for a month and I am stressing. I dunno what I’m gonna do. I cant do any of my school work because my parents forced me to give my laptop to my sister and I have asked her for it back four times and shes ignoring me. I tried to talk to my mom about something really important today and she decided to be an asshole and act like a four year old and wouldn’t let me talk and then, got on tiktok and acted like I wasn’t there. I haven’t eaten anything but a candy bar today because I cant cook at all and I have nothing that doesn’t require cooking and they refused to help me out. So I tried to look up some recipes with what we had and it was all too complicated. I told her I got myself a therapist and she belittled me for it. This was a big deal because it required a lot of phone calls to several people and I have horrible anxiety. I’m so frustrated and so tired of living in this house. 

This happened a few days ago. 

Long story short dad asked me to change the trash. We have three bins in the kitchen, one was shoved under the counter and I didn’t even realize it was there. I went to go do the other thing he asked me after stopping in my room for like five mins to tell a friend I’d be back, and as I leave my room he comes stomping down to my room 

Conversation:

Him: whatd I ask you to do
Me: im going to finish right now
Him: Why didn’t you change the trash?
Me: what are you talking about? I did?
Him: Not all of them why dont you do what I fucking ask of you
Me: I literally am doing it right now

He walks away and I say to my mom when i get in the kitchen

“He can get out of bed to come yell at me about not changing the trash but cant get out of bed to change the trash”

He must’ve been eavesdropping because theres no way he heard me say that otherwise. From his bedroom to the kitchen, I live in a rather large house. 

Anyway. 
He comes busting through the sliding glass door in our kitchen and this convo ensues. 

Him: you got something to say?!
Me: I dont wanna fight with you
Him: then do what the fuck I ask of you
(Keep in mind im literally changing the last bin as hes screaming at me)
Me: i am literally doing it right now jesus christ!

He walks away after slamming the glass door so hard it shakes. 

I sit down at the table with mom and he comes down the hall, I look at him and he literally makes a face at me like a fucking five yo.

A min later I say to mom as dad is still in the hall.

Me: alright give me a hug 
Ma: are you going to bed?
Me: No but im not gonna come out of my room for a bit
Ma: Okay I love you

I go back to my room and realize I forgot my phone so I go back to get it. He calls me into his room as im walking back down the hall. 

Me: what do you want 
Him: Thought you weren’t gonna come out of your room
Me: Leave. Me. Alone.

I go to my room. My mom calls me out again to help her with something 

He calls me into his room again

Him: Just wanted to say I love you
Me: Oh so now you wanna be nice?
Him: I’m always nice 
Me: yeah ok
Him: except when you dont do what i ask
Me: Can you stop acting like a five year old? Youre 51 not 5 
Him: Im not you are, and if you’d do what I ask I wouldn’t be mean 
Me screaming because I am so frustrated and on the verge of tears: do you get off on being a douchebag to people? 
Him: no I just wanted to tell you I loved you
Him as im walking out of his room: and I know you love me too 

Sounds less dramatic than it was, but he does this constantly and i’m fucking over it. Excuse my language but I seriously am so angry and so upset. 

My dad had told me he’d kill me if he found out I was gay, because my sister outed my then boyfriend and I to my mother, and in turn she was calling me names and hitting me for a two weeks and in front of boyfriend. As he was there when I was confronted. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I work at Taco Bell like four hours for four days a week and am refused more hours. So I cant get out. They refuse to help me out with anything. I needed physical therapy and my insurance covers it but I cannot drive yet so I didn’t get to go. Six years ago I broke my ankle and needed surgery but he wouldn’t take me, so I broke my ankle again about two years ago or so, and now its even worse and I need it fixed but again he won’t take me. But he refuses and I mean REFUSES to teach me how to drive or to just let me take the test and try to wing it. (I can drive there are just still things I am not confident doing) I don’t have a bank account because I cannot get there to set up the account so I have some weird Taco Bell supplied debit card. I dunno. What am I supposed to do? I am at a loss. Am I crazy? Am I the problem here? I do everything they ask, I take the trash out every week for them, I clean the house, I clean up after my mothers five dogs including my own. (My mother is a SERIOUS hoarder) I dunno what my purpose even is making this post, I guess I just needed to get it out to someone, or people I feel like won’t be mean to me. So thank you to anyone who reads this."
I wish he would be mine,"
I'm 16 year old and had a online best friend who is the same age. He became really sad and depressed after a while... I was always there for him and he was always there for me but then he suddenly deleted his account. After some weeks I found out that he made a new account but didn't message or follow me with it. I emetly messaged him and asked him why he is doing this to me coz me and him were really close. He said sorry and said that he was thinking about me the whole time. He still don't follow me now but I stalked his account and did read every of his post... And well... One of his posts said that his depression got so worse that he didn't want to bother his online friends and that's why he made a new account. After the talk I had with him we never talked to eachother again and every day I'm just waiting for him to message me again or to at least follow me... It hurts so much coz we were so close... Some people may think I take it too serious but I even had a crush on him which he know but he said that he sadly already have a girlfriend. I don't know what to do... I just want it back like the old times... I want to talk to him again... I miss him.... This makes me so depressed... But I'm not sure if he want me to leave him alone or not

I even said to him that I will always love him and that I only want him but he said that he love me too (idk if he mean the ,, I love you,, as a friend or more coz he always call me sweetie) but have a girlfriend and didn't know that I have a crush on him. He also said that maybe I should look for a another boy... See everyone.... He said maybe and it looks like that he is kinda interested ... That's what confuse me... Does it mean that he would date me when he would be single? Or am I just too obsessed with him and imagine too much?"
Corona virus,"So I’ve posted on here before of my mothers cancer diagnosis (post probably deleted) and the coronavirus is in the county right next to my small town and it’s scaring the fuck out of me as my mother could just fucking vanish if she gets this
     I really don’t want her to get it, but knowing my luck bad shits gonna happen. Ive been so fucking stressed and it’s hard to think. Her immune system is horrible and it’s hard for her to recover from a common cold so I can’t imagine what that shit will do to her."
The fear of getting fired,"I work a (shitty I guess in terms of pay and overall feel but not shitty because of the people/management) fast food job while juggling school. Work at a mall and hopped from one food place to another (whole different story). This one is infinitely better than the previous one. 

Couple of weeks ago, for the first time since I’ve gotten cashier experience, the cash register came up short 40 dollars. Don’t know how the hell it happened and it petrified me. Don’t know what happened but knew it was my fault 100% because I’m the only other employee there. Just 3 people total work there . They were, as expected, super cool about it. I offered to pay them back and they said no but I was ultimately stubborn and they took it.

This past Sunday was a shit show. It was short again. Don’t recall the amount that was said first because I think the owner said he forgot to put my tips of the day into consideration, but the end result ended up 5 dollars. Still just let them keep my tips (I insisted because they’re genuinely good people and it’s fine if I had fucked up) and like last time, came up with the 5. Doesn’t stop there though. To add a cherry on this shit Sunday, it was discovered that I knew the admin/owner/manager login to the register.

*No*, not for any scandalous reasons, I swear. Not like I can steal money knowing their login or edit transaction amounts. I knew it as to keep track of my credit card tips (I can see from my end when I get a tip and how much but not the total amount of tips I received) and to check the cash flow/how much is supposed to be in the register since in my end, I can’t see it. The first situation scared me shitless and I wanted to myself see where it was at and count it when I could. I also don’t have keys or anything to open the register, owner does. The only time the register is open is when I have a cash transaction. I was in lunch that day and noticed both of the owners (it’s a couple - that’s the “3 of us” part of this post) were outside and looking at the cash register screen. This is unusual because one of them is always outside to be out front and the other is in the kitchen. When it’s me out front, both are inside, doing everything inside the kitchen - prepping, cooking, washing dishes etc. Because of this, a bad feeling immediately washed over me and I feared I was short again, which would be confirmed true as I stated earlier. Once back from my lunch, I was going to see the cash flow and count to make sure it was all in there the next time I had a cash transaction. The login didn’t work anymore. They didn’t wait a day to change it or even confront me about it. They have had to see me login when I wasn’t looking because it was working fine right before my lunch and they were both out there. There’s literally no other reason as to randomly changing the login unless they somehow caught me logging in. Nothing was said to me and all resumed “normal”. 

It’s nothing major but it eats at me because I can only imagine how I must look to them now. Not only is the register short *again* but I knew their login? It eats at me because they’re good people. They’re nice. It’s a small business which is why the employee situation is the way it is and why I 100% wanted to give whatever money was gone, back. I only work two days (already have another job lined up to start in may so either way I’m leaving this place regardless but again, cannot stress how good people they are) so tomorrow is when I’ll finally show face again after all this. Nothing was said about firing or the login thing and the owner even said he’ll see me tomorrow at the same time when I was leaving. I’m just expecting the worst I guess and would hate to be fired when I hardly have anything to my name at the moment and am counting on this job to keep me afloat until at least May. My mind has been going mental gymnastics regarding the whole thing."

This may be a post that has been said here before, somewhere by someone, and I hate being redundant but it’s good to know that I’m not the only person experiencing this pain. 

I spent my entire youth overweight. I was always the heaviest kid in class and I was always the brunt of everyone’s jokes. I spent a lot of time reading and keeping to myself, and almost committed suicide in 7th grade until these kids came over and forced me to sit at their table so I wouldn’t be lonely. I thought I had managed to find a friend group up through high school, but I found out shortly after that all they ever did behind my back was make fun of me and whenever I started making fun of them back suddenly I was the bully and they were the victims. 

I don’t know if anyone here has read or heard of the poem called “To This Day” by Shane Koyczan, but it’s a pretty accurate statement to my thought process regarding myself. I grew up believing in love, knowing it existed, always thinking it would eventually happen to me. 

It never did. Not once. Every girl I ever fell in love with or guy that I thought we would be closer just changed, and ending up mocking me or leading me on, treating me like an option rather than a choice. And yet I still craved it. 

I realized I was kidding myself about my weight my freshman year of college, and started getting my physical health together. It took me two semester but I lost 40 lbs and dropped from 210 to 170. Best shape of my life. I was happy with the way I looked, well, happier. 

Then I started getting noticed by all the girls who previously didn’t even regard me as a choice. After so long of being so belittled by my weight and starving for love and attention from somebody other than the people who raised me, I enjoyed it. I even found a girlfriend. But I hadn’t worked on myself mentally. I was still the same, sad little boy just looking for comfort. My girlfriend at the time asked me what was wrong one night, because she saw I was very sad, and I wanted to tell her everything but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I couldn’t bring myself to open up and have her think I’m some sort of freak or loser only faking sadness to gain attention. 

I ended up ghosting her for a year afterwards. To this day I’ve never really forgiven myself for that. I think I’ve moved on, but I don’t really know. 

I’m in my senior year, and have discovered something that I hope isn’t the truth but it feels to accurate to be false. I’ve tried expressing interests to girls that I like, but since I’m back to my 200 lbs weight, none of them are interested in me the way I am them. I’m not going after super models mind you, just average girls. 

I can’t tell if it’s my weight or they can sense my brooding aura or smell my insecurities or if they’re just not interested at all. It’s always a “Maybe.” With the girls I have interest in. Never a yes or no just a “Maybe” and then they go off and find interest in someone else. 

I’m not mad at them for that, I’m disappointed that they couldn’t just tell me they weren’t interested. Don’t get my hopes up like that. Don’t lead me with a maybe. 

Anyway, the epiphany I had was “They’ll only want you if you become something that benefits them. Right now, you don’t benefit anybody. Not even yourself.”

I’m working out 5 days a week and eating a variety of foods that aren’t high in fat or sugar or anything processed and drinking lots of water, getting enough sleep but I still can’t evade this pervasive feeling of worthlessness. Not even my acting or writing classes bring me any sort of joy, and I’m scared I’m falling further into the void of depression and since I’m sober now all these feelings hit hard from everywhere at once and sometimes I just want to cry because all I’m doing is staring at a wall, thinking nothing, feeling empty. 

I don’t know what to do except keep moving forward but how can I move forward if I’m constantly reminded of the past?"
I guess i too have to be like these guys ha?...," Just the other day me and my bestfriend since highschool and his wife went out for dinner. My friend who happen to have a high paying job for the past 8 months has made him a bit egotistic. He went on how he accumulate x amount of money per month and bought x item, and tell personal stories on how his boss ( Somehow he's very close with his boss) owns a big house, expensive sports car and recently just bought a yacht that cost millions.

as he were telling all of these stories, it made lose interest in the conversation that we were having during the dinner. The reason why is that i'm not a carrot chaser nor care about what the next guy had. But looking at his enthusiasm as he talks about it just made me pretended to listen as i don't want to make myself look rude or disrespectful to the conversation he's giving out.

Eventually, the conversation was about to come to an end. Naturally, of course i just gave a small remark to conclude the conversation by saying the lines of "" Well, i'm glad that you're having a big upgrade in your career and resources, also not to mention having friends and being in an environment of wealthy people. But, i'm leaning more to have a simple life, and even if i'm somewhat rich i would focus my money things that are important such as health. Cuz, there will be a day where i will fall sick and will have to pay the hospital bills that cost fortune. Secondly, i would save it for future emergency expenses such as maintenance, and so on. "" 

After i had giving out my small remark to conclude the conversation.Out of the blue, He started to laugh sarcastically telling me that my remarks are a bunch of pussy talk because apparently he's ideology is that if you're rich i somehow need to be like him and his boss, who needs to buy unnecessarily luxury items. He told me if you're rich why aren't you using it to the fullest?.

I was shocked and at the same time irritate because he wasn't like this before. So, in my defense i told him that i'm a realist and money can sometime vanish out of thin air without even knowing it, and it will be happening if you're not cautious about what you're spending on mindlessly. And even if you have money now, one day the things that you owned maybe or maybe not, has a percentage of being sold to regain some resource to stabilize the financial, as an act of desperation, because this has happen to my father due to the economy where he had to sold his house and car, and being unemployed until today, in which he he also lost as a homeowner and rented a small house along with my mother.

Finally, after i had given out facts after facts of realism unto his face in the most calmly, maturely way. He too got annoyed by my facts and basically using the immature tactics of "" Oh yeah?, yeah well you're gay "". and he said "" Well, that's because you're having an underpaid job. But, if you're having a high paying job you wouldn't saying those kind of things, and you're probably jealous. Jealousy, isn't going to make you successful in any career. "" I then my final reply was "" Sure "". Because at this point i'm just annoyed and had given up by his lack of common sense and the ability to comprehend such simple fact that i had blowing out unto him, and ended the dinner awkwardly and head back out our separate ways."
Feeling dumb at the gym,"I feel super dumb in the gym because i’m overweight. I just stare at the floor because I feel so much shame and sadness about my body. I’m trying to be better and get healthy but it really bothers me when I have to go run on a treadmill in public with other people around all probably thinking that they’re glad they’re in better shape than me or that i’m a fat embarassment. Getting healthy is such a slow burn, a painful humiliating process but there’s no other way around it. I only have myself to blame. I just feel really embarassed and it bothers me!"
Cut contract with my abusive family. Don’t have any friends. My partner is withdrawn lately and I don’t know why. I feel completely alone.,"I don’t know what to do at this point. My partner lost their job a few weeks ago, and has been incredibly depressed. But they’ve been getting more withdrawn lately and have been toxic to me today. I want to hurt about my family, even though they were driving me to panic attacks every time we spoke. The dislike of them for all the bad things is mixed in with the pain of losing people I’ve known for 26 years. Hearing coworker’s fond memories of holiday gatherings is making it even harder, despite the fact that I never had one even with them around. But I don’t feel like I can bring this up to my partner when they won’t speak more than 5 words to me. 

And I don’t have anybody else. I don’t know what to do."
I’m passing a kidney stone,In pain and the bowl is getting bloody. This just sucks!!!
I can't believe that I'm settling for a job that I never planned on keeping.,I got this job while I was in college in hopes that it'll help me financially until I finished my education. Now that I stopped going to school and haven't been back I'm now unhappy and stressed that I will be stuck on this job because I haven't figured out what to do for a career.
I'm short 175 dollars on my till.,I don't know how I fucked up so badly. This is my third week as a cashier. The manager called me and said it might have had to do with a bad food stamps transaction.

My sexual frustration and lack of love life,"I'm a moralistic virgin that wants to wait for her first relationship to have sex.


I always get ghosted after dates. Both on dating apps and IRL.

I'm 23, speak 3 languages , lived in 3 countries, have a degree, a good job and side projects that I enjoy and love.

I usually go two years or more without being asked out, caressed or kissed. 

I have tried all dating apps and putting myself out there IRL and even asked men out myself.

The sexual frustration is terrible, orgasms are terrible and I feel unloved and unwanted.

I have gave Reddit a go at least 6 times, to at least try and find an online relationship. With the person I talk to ghosting after max 5 days.

The idea of paying someone to at least kiss me and touch me has crossed my mind. My sexual frustration is so bad it actually turns into physical pain.

Sometimes I try and imagine I'm in the arms of a singer I fancy or something bring me some sort of comfort.

I'm a fucking joke a woman."
I haven't been kissed in half a year,"And is killing me!

Both the need for emotional and physical attention.

And before someone suggests ""get on tinder"" or ""go to a nightclub "" it doesn't work that way for me.

Also, my luck in dating is terrible 😭💔"
"I know I should be thankful for what I have, but I’m just always so sad.","Real first world problems here, but I just wanna get this off my chest and get some advice. I’m a junior in high school. My grades are a mix of Bs and As but my school has such high standards that I feel like shit every time I look at those Bs. I have a long time case of social anxiety and so many good friends I had has left me. My sleep schedule is messed up (like an owls) and every single fucking thing is revolved around college and I just can’t stand the pressure. I want to do well in life but I know that means stepping out my of comfort bubble and pursuing my dreams but my anxiety has gotten so bad that I feel like giving up. I know this is wrong but I’m always comparing myself to others and it sickens me. I spend so much time hating on good people just because they achieved more than me. I’m just rambling on at this point but Please help, I just want to be happy."
Why do I always f*ck up?,"When I try to help, it doesn't come across as I intended, either be an actual action or just listening to someone.

I'm sorry if I ever made someone feel bad. It was not intended.

Why am I so fucking clumsy?

"Feeling emotional, decided to isolate myself.","So, I am more of using this post to act as an journal. Today Ive been feeling a bit needier than usual. What I mean by that is I want to stay and cuddle with my BF a lot more than I usually want to. This wouldn't be an issue, but I know he has to get his work done. Even though I just want his security and companionship I know that I can give myself the same thing that I am searching for in him. So, I decided to go back to my apartment because when I am at this state of mind, I get offended easily and I begin to over react over tiny things. Its kinda like my emotions are on hypersensitivity mode. I am pretty tired so I am sure my sleep deprivation and mild dehydration has something to do with it lol. I wanted to get this off my chest just because I choose to not put myself in a situation that would cause me to become overtly emotional. I am pretty happy about it. Even though I want to text and call him at this instance, I just know that I am being too needy and too dependent on him. So I write to you reddit as my outlet for my anxieties and insecurities. A little sad, but I am working on me."
I got in trouble for eating cereal at work today,"And it really grinds my gears! I work for a healthcare organization that you would think would encourage and promote a healthy lifestyle. For years it’s been a ritual of mine to take a few minutes to quickly chomp down my Cheerios before getting to work. Due to new department changes, we were told that we were no longer allowed to eat ‘a meal’ at our desk, but I got special permission to quickly eat my daily cereal in the break room before getting to work. Well, today my supervisor informed me that I can no longer do this since technically I was on company time and it looks bad that I’m taking a break so early into my shift. Sure, valid point and I completely understood where she was coming from. My complaint is that we’re allowed to eat snacks at our desks (things such as donuts, coffee, candy, chips, ice cream, etc), but it’s not ok to eat a healthy bowl of cereal because apparently that’s classified as a meal!? Makes no sense. I’m pissed because of this and had to vent. Grrrrrr!!"
Stressed about not having enough time/prioritizing,"I am constantly stressed about not using my time right. I am a kind of person that always have lots of interests and projects, and I feel like I never have enough time to do them all, and I also feel a constant pressure to spend more time on each one. A lot of times this leads me to not doing any of them, because I cannot really choose one. Those times it's like I don't even really want to do any of them, but I feel like I should. I also find it hard to start on one of them because by choosing one, I am choosing not to do a bunch of other things. Paradoxically, this leads to not doing anything which is an even worse waste of time, and that generates even more stress.

The stress makes me on edge, restless and angry. Especially when certain unexpected things happen that needs my time. I get angry with having to do something I don't want to do, when I don't feel like I have the time to do the things I want to do. I also find it hard to just relax. Right now, I am stressed that I spent 10 minutes writing this post, instead of doing some of the things I ""should"" be doing.

The strange thing is that none of these projects are really important. They can be things like get better at Fortnite, or practice playing the guitar, or even read a book. I know that, in the greater picture, none of these things really matter a lot, but that doesn't really help, because I still *feel* like those things are important. I actually value the idea of doing/learning lots of stuff, so I wouldn't want to become a person with no, or just a few, interests. I have tried a billion different ways to prioritize and manage my time, but it doesn't work (and I suspect it's because time management isn't really the issue here).

Maybe I just have to accept that being a person with lots of projects (a person i want to be), inevitably leads to stress about not doing it all. My brain knows that I cannot have my cake and eat it too. i wish my feelings would have the same knowledge."
My boyfriend's X-Mas Vacation is more than I can afford.,"My boyfriend and his family have gone on a 2 week long ski trip every year for 15 years. This will be our 3rd Christmas together and I can no longer put off going with them. His mother bought a season pass for me without telling me last Feb. In my mind this meant it was a gift, she asked me last month to pay her back. Its a $300 pass and I did not have the funds so my bf graciously offered to pay it as a Christmas gift. Now I don't have a snowboard(I cant ski) or boots and I stupidly assumed that rentals were included in my package because it was a high price for an early season pass. Now Im faced with having to pay for rentals but at the price I may as well buy my own bored. I just don't have the money for this trip, and Im taking 2 weeks off work. My bfs family do not seem to care. They don't seem to realize that I just don't have the money for this on hand. Had I known about the amount of money needed for this trip I could have saved over the year. But they would not give me any info, when I asked questions their response was ""don't worry about it, everything will be fine."" Im so pissed at this situation."
A year ago I posted I quit my job. Follow up!,"A year ago quit my job and posted to this subreddit [{LINK}](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/3fnnfu/what_my_coworkers_dont_know/)

To appropriately conclude the last year, it went great. Quitting my job was the best decision. The company changed swiftly in the next six months and had high turnover. It would've been chaotic had I stayed.

I found a job not too long after quitting. It was a contract that paid me 257% more and I had more room to grow and step up.

What I'm doing now is my own seo company and other cool projects. Oh and I married a wonderful friend.

All in all, I 100% encourage others to summon the bravery in times of uncertainty. When all seems lost remain calm and reason the path into existence.

2. Acquired New Job with 257% raise

It's my birthday :-|,"I'm not a big birthday person, I don't like being the center of attention so always try to keep it super low key and small. My mom remembered as always, we are close. My dad forgot, sort of surprised, and pretty sure my brother has no clue, we haven't really talked in the past couple years, I text him for holidays and his birthday. 

The worst part is my girlfriend of almost six months is upset and not talking to me. As far as I can tell she is upset because I wasn't as excited about it as she thought I would be. I've told her I'm not really into birthdays and I didn't want a party, just a nice dinner was good, which we did. we got home and she went to bed way earlier then we ever do and had no desire to cuddle up so here I am sitting on the couch watching tv with her flat mate. 

Don't know why I'm not a fan of my birthday but from what I can remember I've never really been into it. I'll talk to her tomorrow I guess and hopefully figure out what's going on. 

Time to try to clear my head and get some sleep. Nighty night Reddit "
"Depressed girlfriend of 3 years cheated on me. Feeling alone, betrayed, and inadequate","My past has been has basically been myself being alone most of the time. Weird kid in school and nobody a girl would want to be with. Until she came along.

We were happy. She has had a tough past as well. Much worse than mine. Up to the point where she cuts and was suicidal for a short period of time. She told me I made her happy and she always wrote me letters saying how much I meant to her.

I always made mistakes like forgetting to ask her if she wanted breakfast out when she came over in the morning or forgetting to tell her I was hanging out with some female friends. Things like that ate away at her and she cheated on me. She regrets she did it and is trying her best to fix herself now.

But now I feel betrayed. I feel like I can't trust anyone again. Someone who said so many kind things to me, who made me feel like I mattered. 

I'm scared because I'm alone again for the first time in 3 years and a few months. I've never done well when I was alone.

And I felt like a lot of it was my fault. I was too tired from work to come over sometimes even when she was feeling alone. I didn't treat her like my priority though I loved her more than anything. 

I need any kind of help please. Anything. "
"Why did the bullet not go through her skull, and did she suffer much?","I had to put down my pet dog, Lucy awhile back. She was close to 20 and in bad health. She only had a few teeth left, and they were loose and rotten. She had been hit by a car when she was young and had a bad back ever since. She couldn't control her bladder well anymore. She was losing her eyesight, and her hearing was almost completely gone. She had lumps in her neck that I thought might have been cancer. She had a few episodes when she would yelp loudly for extended periods of time as if she was being kicked repeatedly. One morning my grandmother told me there was something wrong with her. Apparently before I woke up she had been acting weird and stumbling around like she was about to pass out. My grandmother told me she then yelled, fell over and just layed there not trying to get back up. I got to her as soon as possible. She was lying there as if she was just giving up. Her mouth was open, and her tongue was hanging out. She was breathing heavily. I knew she was in pain and something had just happened to her. Maybe a stroke or heart attack. I don't know. I didn't think she would recover, and I knew that if she did, she would only get worse. I knew for sure at the moment she was suffering, and if I let her she would eventually suffer more. I decided it was time to end her suffering. I couldn't stand watching her that way. We didn't have the money to take her to the vet for them to put her down. So I took her outside, and after the most heartbreaking moments I had ever experienced saying goodbye and letting her know how much I loved and appreciated her and her companionship, I attempted to shoot her in the head with my .40. I completely missed the first time. I guess I was so upset that I wasn't controlling the shot well. Lucy jumped up immediately, startled and frightened. However, she didn't go anywhere. Just looked at me as if to say, ""What are you doing?"" Looking back, I could have decided not to kill her at that point. However, as I mentioned already, if I didn't she would suffer more and longer. So I steadied myself and took another shot. I didn't miss. The bullet hit her skull, but it didn't go through. Instead, it grazed around the side of her head. It left a wound from the top of her head past her ear. She just stared at me, still not going anywhere. I was so pissed off at myself that I had done that to her. Here I was thinking that I would put her out of her suffering, but it seemed as though I was just scaring and mutilating her. I was absolutely taken aback from the bullet not going through. I was disgusted with myself. I knew that the next shot had to count. I wasn't about to have another fluke, and cause her more pain and stretch it out any longer. I didn't trust the bullet to go through her skull, so I did the next best thing I could think of. I shot her in the neck. This time the bullet went through. Blood began to pour. She fell down and began the horrible twitching. I knew that shot had been successful. Please be empathetic with me. I loved Lucy. She was an amazing friend. We had been through a lot together. I was torn apart. I just couldn't let her keep suffering. However, I feel full of regrets. One thing is what I've already described, about how it didn't go as planned. Why didn't the bullet go through? It was a target round because that's the only ammo I had, but still, a .40 round should've had no problem at that range, less than three feet. Did I cause her more suffering than she would've experienced if I hadn't done it? That's probably the biggest one. Next, I wish we would've had the money to keep her healthy and when the time came to have her put down professionally. It just didn't work out, and in a way, I feel I failed her. I think she would forgive me, but I don't know. It just sucks. I'm in tears typing this. I've had dreams about what happened. I've had dreams that seemed so real where we'd be playing together like normal. I had dreams where I'd just walk through the house, look over and see her laying there sleeping or relaxing watching me walk by. Then I'd wake up, and be overwhelmingly sad. It took me weeks to stop looking for her in the house or not expect to hear her walking through the kitchen like always or expect her to run into the kitchen whenever someone was getting food hoping for a snack herself. Any time I think about it, I get very sad and want to just stop. To give you a feel of how much I loved and cared for Lucy, I didn't cry at my great grandmother or grandfather's funeral. Nor did I cry at my great aunt's funeral. I hardly ever cry. That day, I bawled like a baby from the beginning to the end, and I'm crying now. I'd be happy to hear any supportive comments. I want the negative ones as well, though, if there are any. If I'm doing anything incorrectly as far as the post location or format, I'm sorry. This is my first reddit post. I created an account just for this, because Yahoo Answers wouldn't let me post the whole thing. Thank you for your time."
pregnant ex gf,"Sorry it's long.  

Moved to a city with a girl about a year ago. Before moving, in the early stages of our relationship, I got her pregnant.  We were using, minimally and incorrectly, various forms of contraceptive...it was stupid and bound to happen. We talked about options and went with abortion.  It was a hard decision that neither of took lightly, on the contrary, it is a very heavy decision to make.   
So fast forward a few more months, we decide that we are the real deal and that our early tribulations are only a testament to our devotion, yada yada yada...moved across the country for a change of scenery and to kill time (i'm working on getting into professional school in the mean time).   
A few months in, our relationship heads south- the details do not really mean anything to this story, only that it's turned south for me meaning I am the one falling out of love, not her. I end up breaking up with her, but we still have a lease together and still really only ave each other in this new city. So to avoid breaking lease, which we couldn't afford, we just rode the lease out. Me sleeping on the couch a lot (we had a 600sq ft apt).  Now, there was no animosity or real contempt or anything. I just fell out of love with her and made it clear that once the lease is over, I'll be gone. She said she would rather spend this time with me doing fun things together than just to lose me now and possibly never see me again (i had plans to move back across country having gotten into my professional school) Under this pre-condition, we still spent lots of time together. We slept together once every couple of weeks, sometimes more sometimes less.  This went on for the months of february and march, I left in april.   
We haven't talked much since I've been home.  I've gotten over the relationship. It's harder for her.  We have mostly stopped talking. Until yesterday. She texts and calls. It was my birthday yesterday. I didn't want drama. I didn't respond. She sends a text this morning.  She is pregnant. She didn't want to tell me like that, but I didn't answer my phone when she called.  She sounded angry. Then she told me she is just angry at herself.  She had lied to me about taking her birth control for the month of march (even though I made a point to ask every time- sorry but she really sucked at taking the pill when she first started on it was necessary).  
I just can't even... why? It's so silly and so irresponsible.  She has told me not to worry about it. She is having another abortion in a couple days. She doesn't want my help, she says. She can do it on her own, she says.   It's all arranged.  I don't know what to do. I've made myself available to her (i told her this). If she needs anything I told her to let me know. Is this enough?  I know I share responsibility, but I'm angry that she lied to me about the birth control... i just don't, like why the fuck... it doesn't matter though. What's done is done. Happy birthday to me and my unborn children. fuck.  
thanks for reading.

Girlfriend of 3 and a half years doesn't love me anymore,The other day my girlfriend of 3 and half years and who I was planning to marry told me she doesn't love me anymore. Today she posted a Snapchat story of her with her ex calling him cute. Everything seemed fine before this and it just came out of no where. I feel so lost and betrayed and hurt. I dont know what to do or how to handle this. She lives with my grandma and is supposedly moving out and we have a phone plan together I just don't know what to do now. 
Am I wrong for being so pissed off?,"Right now I am angrier at my girlfriend than I have ever been. 

A couple of months ago, we discovered that our favorite comedian was coming to our town. To our dismay, we also discovered that tickets were already sold out. Bummer, man. 

A couple of days later, we found that he would be in another town about three hours away, but with tickets 1/3 the price of the hometown show. We scooped up tickets for me, her, her best friend, and her best friend's boyfriend. 

A couple of days before the show, her friend had some shit go down and wouldn't be able to make it. That's tough, but my girlfriend and I could still go! But, twas not to be. Girlfriend decided that she wouldn't go without friend. That's a hair frustrating, but completely understandable! That's what good friends do. No problem. 

Two days ago, girlfriend informs me that she and friend found someone selling tickets on craigslist and they are going to the show. What the fuck. If she won't go without her friend, why the hell would it be okay to go without me? It's not like this is just some random fun thing to do. I've been looking forward to seeing this guy for years, and my girlfriend and I have been planning on going to see him together for around a year, before we knew he was coming. Am I stupid for being so goddamn fucking angry about this? "
Wishing I'd talked to a girl back in high school,"So I've been shy for as long I can remember, it's not as bad as it used to be before I had really good friends, but by any normal measurements it's pretty bad. 

I've been out of high school for almost a year now and I've taken time off to work and make money and have a break from school work. I hate my job, I wash dishes every day and only see my friends at night. I've been feeling really unsatisfied with my life and realized that I miss school even with how awkward I felt a lot of the time. 

I miss when I would learn about stuff that actually interested me and I miss meeting people with similar interests. I never realized how hard it'd be to meet people once you're no longer in school. Since I've been thinking about school so much eventually my thoughts turned toward a girl in the same grade as me who I had 3 classes with my senior year and who I crushed on hard pretty much the whole year. 

She's cute definitely, curvy if nothing else, but what I really liked about her was her mind. I think intelligence and confidence are extremely attractive and this girl was both intelligent and confident. Or at least she seemed to be. The reason I say that is because one of my friends worked with her and they texted sometimes and he said she was actually really insecure which blows my mind because there was literally no reason for this girl to feel like that, but anyway. 

She was really smart and had a sarcastic sense of humor just like I do, literally every thing I heard come out of this girls mouth made me like her more. In one of the classes we had together I'd play music sometimes and I would play stuff like Beck (I'm very big into alternative music) and she would be into it which I loved because it's hard for me to find other people into the music that I'm into. She also always dressed really nice which seems random but I like dressing well myself so it stands out to me whenever girls do the same.

Let me see what else... she also hated the small town in Pennsylvania we lived in (she went to school out of state) and was into theater (I took four years of drama classes in high school), drinking (I prefer smoking weed but hey whatever), and books (I used to read a book a day) among other things I'm sure I would have discovered had we ever hung out. 

Despite all this, I never asked her to hang out once when we were in school together. When she signed my yearbook she even said she'd wished we'd been better friends. There's no reason for this besides my anxiety at approaching girls and I feel ashamed that I never did anything. I don't know why I'm writing this as I doubt anybody is gonna see it but I'm glad I wrote it all out if nothing else. "
I found out my dead grandfather murdered my nan when my mum was young,"Me, my brother, and my mother were eating dinner last year at a restaurant. We were having jokes and having a good time. Eventually the conversation goes steers toward my dead grandfather. It's here mum starts getting emotional saying us two are the only family she has now (one uncle is in prison, the other she doesn't talk to because of pretty horrid quarrels which I won't be going into). It's here my brother asks her what happened to nan (All I knew about her was that she was dead and that granddad remarried) 


It's here she spills the beans. She starts tearing up and explains when she was little she heard her father beat her mother to death. 


The meal was awkward after that. She wouldn't elaborate the rest of the holiday. I had to ask my dad to elaborate and he only knew what mum told him: not much. But he confirmed it: my grandfather was a murderer. 


I don't know how the bastard got away with it. He was in the army. This would have been around the sixties/seventies I'd imagine. 


I hate that man. I wish there was a heaven just so I'd know he's rotting in hell. This evil abusive piece of shit used to tell me bed time stories. Part of me wishes he was still alive so I could kick his ass. He stole my nan from me and my brother and a mother from my mother.  I hate him so much and yet he died before I had the chance to confront him. I can't even deface a grave as its so far away. I went to this things funeral and little did I know I was paying respects to a monster. 



How can I come to terms with it? How do I move on? What would make me feel better?"
"Anytime my phone says ""No caller ID"" i get very shaken up because of past harrassment","i once had false charges against me and i had to deal with plenty of calls from the police who always called with ""No caller ID"" on my phone. Nothing ever came of it because the person making charges dropped them because they were just trying to intimidate me and at monetary cost i would have won the case because the charges were completely and utterly false. i still was harrassed by police officers who treated me like i was guilty over the phone and i made it worse by talking to them. I was unaware of the right to silence at the time and i should have just closed my mouth and lawyered up.  

 Just 20 minutes ago i got a call from no caller ID, while its probably not the police i still couldn't answer it and i just feel really shaky. ive gotten a stomach ache and i feel really on edge. This happens every single time a no caller ID calls and i can't stand it. thats whats bothering me right now. "
I've just failed my course because i'm lazy as shit,i've just failed my cert 4 in surveying and feel like shit. I constantly just ignored the problem and didn't re-submit assignments that i got wrong. My Mum paid for the course (~$3000) and all i've done is fuck it up by being lazy and complacent. Having wasted my last 6 months and my mums money i feel like a piece of shit. Now i'm doubting if i even want to do this as a job anymore (do have cert 3) and what the fuck im doing with my life. Now with Christmas just around the corner i'm going to have to explain to the majority of my family what i have just done. Happy Holidays
Last year in high-school and I still have no idea what I want to do.,"I was never the most committed worker. I was always a lazy slob. But somehow I always managed to follow through the stuff I wanted to do. I was always able to take as much time as possible with everything I do. Hell, there are still creative projects of mine, that I'm working on for a few years now. They're laying there waiting for being finished, which will eventually happen.... probably.

In short, whatever I did, or planned to do, I eventually started doing, working on them for years, finishing them slowly. I like to leave homework to the last day too.

With this altitude, I was able to crawl through high-school. Five years even, because of the preparatory first year.

The thing is, deciding what I want to do with myself, isn't one of the projects that I was able to finish. I'm still completely in the dark about it. Only ideas to play around with for a month, then comes the next. Truck driver? Teacher? The current one is journalist. The best probably would be some kind of creative job, but that's only going to earn me enough if I'm really well-known.

I don't want to be like my brother, who just hangs around playing League of Legends and complaining about his shitty job all day. I don't want a shitty job. I don't want to be trapped within excruciating routines. The worst part is, that I'm too much like my brother. I also tend to hang on the computer all day, do nothing productive for weeks.

I'm trying to change that behavior. It's one of my ongoing projects."
All I can Ever Think About Is Girls,"It's the most annoying thing in the world. I don't know why but they are all I can think about. All I ever want to do is hang out with any girl I am attracted to. I recognize it as neediness.

It's so damn frustrating because I know I can have fun without girls and I know I should be focusing on my studies or whatever else...but I obsess and obsess over them. 

I am sure someone else has dealt with this. How'd you get over...overthinking of girls? "
My fiance found religion...,"I'm an atheist and have been most of my life. When I originally met my fiance she was an atheist, which is one of the things that attracted me to her because we had a lot of things in common. Saying that, I'm not an atheist that's against religion. My entire family is religious and at certain family events everyone prays before a meal and I always bow my head and show respect. 

About three weeks ago my fiance asked me to attend church with her and her family. No big deal. We wanted to go. Well she has now found God and is completely changing her life around. Don't get me wrong, I'm very proud of her and respect her but I don't know how to handle the situation. I keep going to church with her and such but it's weird. I love her to death and would never leave her at this point but it kind of makes me sad that we don't have that one thing in common anymore and she's changing a little.

I probably seem like a huge asshole but can someone tell me if I'm being too judgmental? I love my fiance and I always will, I just need some advice on how to be more understanding and not feel any animosity towards her."
I hate my voice,"There's something about my voice I've just always hated. It's not that it's too high pitched or too low pitched(though it's higher pitched than I'd like it to be), it's just kind of annoying sounding to me. I think it also annoys other people too, though I've never been told it does. When I speak I hear myself differently then the way other people hear me, because when I heard myself speak via video for the first time I hated the way my voice sounded. It sounded completely different than the way I perceived myself to sound. I even went through a period of time when I purposely changed my voice, though I couldn't keep it up for long.. Oddly enough I think it's effecting my confidence, because a lot of the time I'll think if I talk than It'll just come out annoying so I just keep quiet most of the time. Also my voice doesn't fit the way I physically look either, I feel as if god accidentally mixed up my voice with some one else... I just wanna rant. Feels good actually, talking about something without having to listen to myself sound stupid."
"Feeling a little empty, alone, and without direction.","I really just feel like writing right now.  Something about putting my thoughts and feelings into words and putting them out there, even anonymously, sounds like it might make me feel better.  I'm not even sure what kind of response I want, if anything.  I hope this post even makes sense when I'm done, because I don't really have a goal here, just to put my thoughts down.

I'm a male and just turned 29 recently.  I've been single pretty much my entire life.  I had a few little flings in high school that didn't last more than 2 weeks, but I don't really count them.  I've never considered myself to be in a relationship, and I don't even know what that means.  

Though with that said, I have a pretty okay life.  I have a great job, my career is pretty secure, I'm debt free... nothing to really complain about there.  I guess in this regard I consider myself a ""success"".  

My family leaves something to be desired.  Don't get me wrong, I love them.  But it sure didn't turn out the way I wanted.  My parents stayed together as long as they could, for my sister and I.  Their relationship was always pretty rocky.  Pretty much right around the time I graduated college, it fell apart.  My mom cheated on my dad, and not long after they were divorced.  Didn't talk to my mom for awhile after that, but we're good now.  Though I can't stand cheaters, and may have some trust issues as a result.  Got into a stupid fight with my dad awhile back, we spent years not talking.  We've ""patched things up"" now but things are awkward and forced when I'm around him.  My mom, dad, and sister all live in their own apartments.  I don't have a home to go back to anymore.  I mean, it doesn't feel like home.  Selfishly, its not what I wanted.

I'm not really in a hurry to get married and start my own family, but I definitely want it.  I want a partner, I want kids, I want a home.  But, if my 29 years of being single is any indication, sometimes it starts to look like I might not get what I want.  I know I still have time, but I still worry that I won't ever meet someone to start a family with.  The idea of adoption has started to cross my mind.  Though 30 is a bit early to ""give up"" and even if I decided to, finding someone to let a single dude adopt in this day is probably near impossible.

There's a girl I like.  We're pretty good friends, I think.  She's younger than me, almost 25.  I'm pretty crazy about her, but it is one sided.  I asked her out about a year ago, but she told me she only wanted to be friends.  I tried to get over her, but it didn't work.  We're even better friends now, and unfortunately my feelings are stronger than ever.  I've started seeing a therapist at work because I let these feelings affect me too much.  We've agreed that I need to talk to her again and let her know my feelings.  If she agrees, great.  If she doesn't, then I need to move on.  I've just been waiting for the appropriate time...

She moved to this area for work, but she's never really loved it here.  There's somewhere else she would rather be.  I find out this week she had a job interview out there, and it went well.  She hasn't decided if she is taking it or not, but she is considering it.  So this girl that I am crazy about might be leaving.  I will tell her my feelings regardless, but I don't want her to go.  Even if she isn't my girlfriend or whatever, she's still my closest friend I have here.

I find myself thinking that if she leaves, my life is going to feel really empty.  And that probably isn't healthy one way or the other.  What am I doing?  I go to work, I exercise, I occasionally hang out with friends, but a lot of the time I'm just at home doing nothing.  Right now, I'm sitting here alone on this three day weekend.  My friends are all busy with other stuff, and I don't know what she's doing right now, but I know she has a lot on her mind.  I'm an introvert, I usually enjoy my alone time, but right now... I want to see her.  But I need to give her space.

Besides.  I don't think she feels comfortable hanging out with just me outside of work.  I've suggested several times that we do something, but she never does unless it is in a group setting.  I couldn't say what the deal is for sure.  Maybe she's afraid of leading me on?  Maybe I've misunderstood our friendship and she doesn't like me as much as I thought?  These thoughts cross my mind.  They make me sad, too.  I would never force myself on her or make an un-welcome move.  Even if she doesn't want to date me or be in a relationship, I still want to be friends, I just really like who she is as a person.

That's pretty much where I'm at right now.  Alone on a long weekend, only one person I can think about right now, and she's thinking about leaving my life all together.  

That's all, really, I guess.  I'm expecting responses of people telling me I need to get over her.  I know.  Like I said, I am seeing a relationship therapist about it.  And we have a plan for me to talk to her so I can potentially move on.  But I'm going to wait for her to make her decision on whether she is staying or leaving.  This choice she is making isn't about me.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.  I hope your weekend is going well."
I can never have a pet until I move out.,"It sounds dumb, but I always wanted a real pet. All of the pets I have gotten were all fish, and it gets boring after a while. My mom says ""I won't do anything to take care of it."" However, I *want* to change that. I say ""I'll clean the tank, litter box, whatever, I just want a pet."" She then says ""I don't like animals, so too bad."" There's no point in saying I should take care of it if you'll never get me a pet because of *your* preferences. I sound greedy, I know, but it gets boring having a sister who always wants to pick a fight, a dad who is always working, and a mom who just wants grades out of you.

I have always wanted a cat, a hamster, a rabbit, or even a snake. Something that I can take care of and have fun watching. It could be an experience that can change me for the better. I could gain a sense of responsibility, so I can be responsible when I get older. There are other ways, but taking care of a living thing is the best way to gain responsibility.

I have to wait about 12 years, because if I live with some friends after I graduate college, my mom would fucking kill me. It's something I have to deal with for a while, and I don't even need all of the pets I listed, just one. If I have a good argument, it's no use, because it's always ""I don't like animals."" She's not allergic or anything, my mom just hates animals. She says, and I quote, ""If you get a pet I would just kick it."" 

What the actual fuck?! That's cruel, even for her. My mom once laughed in my face for asking for a kitten, which hurt a bit, especially because she decided to tell *everyone in my fucking family*. Everyone in my immediate family laughed, but cousins and everyone didn't really care, so that's okay.

Sorry for the vent, it just bothers me way too much."
I lost an hour this morning and I don't know why.,"I woke up this morning around 8:45 and checked my phone at 8:56.  A massive, awful headache came on, a high-pitched ""EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"" filled my ears, and everything got brighter, almost to a white color.  I nurse my headache for a few minutes before I leave for work, and what felt like 5 minutes later, I check my phone for the time, and it's 9:53.  

I lost almost an hour of time in the migraine, and I have no clue how that happened or what happened in that hour.  I don't know if this has happened before.  And this is in combination with the fact that I've been getting my friends' names wrong, and my brain has been spelling words wrong more consistently than normal.

I'm kind of scared right now.  I don't know what's going on, and I don't know what to do now, or if I have to do anything now.

**EDIT:**  Thanks to you all for your concern.  I'm already feeling significantly better than I did this morning.  I went to campus health services an hour ago.  She poked and prodded, then told me it was probably a migraine.  This is the first migraine I've ever actually had.  She said that the lost hour can be explained by it.  She said Advil + a little caffeine + rest would probably make me feel a hell of a lot better, but that it may not go away entirely for up to 48 hours.  If the Advil (and once the Advil wears off, Alleve) don't do anything for me, or if it gets worse again, I'll have someone bring me to the urgent care center near our school.  

Thanks so much for your responses.  You guys snapped me out of ""What the hell just happened to me, let's put everything back to normal"" and into the ""Let's figure out what's going on and get it fixed"" mode.  "
To the person who outd me as transgender [Update],"I send my last post to her via Facebook. She flat out denied telling anyone and blamed my other, much closer friends I also told for outing me. She was lying through her teeth and it showed. Basically trying to gaslight me. She said I was being rude to her for no reason and starts to berate me. I blocked her - I don't want her in my life.


I'm still pretty stunned. She's totally not a shitty teenager who made a terrible mistake. She is an unapologetic sociopath. Did not give a fuck about me and used my trust for trivial gossip for people I don't even know. What a crazy bitch!


Her life will go downhill at some point with her sociopathy - she'll simply fuck over the wrong people"
I miss my ex,"It's been more than six months since we split up, but I can't seem to forget about her. I feel pathetic but then again being depressed over a failed relationship is probably fucking pathetic. So does anyone have a little advice for me?
"
I'm probably going to get kicked out of university,"Just finished the first semester of my second year. I failed 3 out of 4 subjects, and I have to take a supplementary exam for the fourth so I have a chance at passing that. Last year I failed half my subjects, so I was already doing badly. I just checked my university account page and my status has changed from ""Academic probation"" to ""Under consideration for exclusion"". So it could be happening.

The worst part? My parents have no idea. They don't even know I've been failing. I kept telling myself I could improve, with every screwed up semester I told myself I could fix up my grades as long as I would be allowed back and you know, I even started to believe it. I didn't feel so bad about keeping my failure from my parents because I thought I could change.

I just wish I could put my head down and do some fucking *work*. This semester wasn't even that bad, I had so many opportunities to make some easy marks but I threw them away for no damn reason. I have no motivation, I'm such a fuck up, I have no idea what to do, I feel sick. I really, *really* hate the kind of person I am.

God I'm sorry if anyone actually read through all that. If you did, thank you, I don't feel like I deserve your attention."
Tired of feeling lonely and not worth anyone's time,"I've never really had more than two or three real friends at any given time in my life. I've had people that would talk to me if they didn't have anything better to do, but rarely have I ever been invited to do anything with them, or have them take me up on my invites towards them. Within the past few years, I've nearly stopped talking altogether, aside from exchanging greetings or goodbyes, and even then, that's probably only twice a week. I haven't had a real, genuine conversation with anyone in a long time. I almost ended up dating an old friend a few months ago, which would have been my first real girlfriend, but I wasn't as outgoing, talkative, or lived as close as she wanted. I've been trying to condition my mind to believe that I'm just not good enough for anyone, yet I still wish that I could be with someone, and it frustrates the hell out of me because I can't truly eliminate the desire to have someone. Every month or so, I'll sign up for a dating site, and usually end up deleting my profile because I'm never what they want. I try to tiptoe through the eggshells of trying to not seem desperate, or coming off too strong, or uninterested, or talking too much about her, or too much about myself, or if my message is too short, or if it's too long, not being too casual, but not being too formal. It doesn't matter whether my profile is brief, detailed, serious, or humorous, because no one is interested.

Even when I grow the balls to ask out someone I've been around for a while, they're either not interested, or already have someone. I don't understand how everyone else in my family and all the people I've ever been friends with have been able to find someone. It makes me feel like I'm some kind of horrible monster that no one wants anything to do with. And then, whenever I feel crushed down from the weight of the world on my shoulders, I've learned that no one cares what I feel, unless what I feel is vomiting forth happiness. No one wants to hear something that's gone wrong, they don't want to kneel down and give a helping hand. I've come to believe that my feelings don't matter, and hide any emotions and experiences that happen to me. Even on reddit, where no one knows who I am, I will type up two hours' worth of heartache and pain, only to delete it because I'm not important to anyone, and what I feel is insignificant. That's been one of the driving forces to lead me to desire a girlfriend. Maybe then would I have someone that would actually be there for me, care about what I feel, care about me as a person, and willingly WANT to be around me without feeling obligated to do so. I feel like I'm some kind of crazy freak for wanting someone that's interested in the things that I'm interested in.

I have no more confidence. I missed the relationship boat back when I was younger and now no one wants to touch me with a ten foot pole. When I went off to college, everyone was telling me that I'd find someone there. I didn't. I didn't even find someone that WANTED to even TRY, much like what the last woman told me a few months ago ""I wouldn't want to waste our time by going out together because I've dated guys like you in the past and it never worked out"". Hell, I even had someone literally turn and run away from me when I told them I really liked them. It wasn't as if I went up to some random stranger, but she was someone I had begun hanging out with after classes for a month. I ended up dropping out because I couldn't handle the loneliness. Couples everywhere and I was too much of a moron to even figure out how to find someone that accepted myself as a person.

I've lost hope. I'm almost 30 and I have no idea what a real relationship is like... no one wants that in a significant other. They want someone experienced. I want to just disappear, but there are so many things that I want to do in life, but the loneliness is just crushing me. At the time being, I'm just holding on, trying to get through each day. It's been like that for months now. I have no job. I almost started up my own business, but I didn't have any support from anyone I know, having to go it alone. I felt that I was really good at what I did, but no one cared. I failed to get a degree for a passion of mine, I failed to start a business, or even get a job in something that I enjoyed and was good at, I failed to find a significant other, I've failed to have and keep any friends, I've failed as a son, and I've failed as a decent human being.

And none of that matters. This is just another sob story about some guy that doesn't know how to get a woman. All I am is text on a page. A face in the crowd. A placeholder. ""Suck it up"" and keep going. ""Man up"""
"I'm just not doing well and I always have to lie about it, even to myself","I gained twenty pounds this year. My uncle thinks it might be the antidepressant I'm taking. (I'm on lithium, klonopin, celexa and haldol).  I look awful. I'm 4'10"" so twenty pounds is a lot. Everybody noticed at my family's BBQ for the fourth. My great aunt asked me if I'm pregnant. 

I'm unemployed. It's a sad story. I got into school for my masters in speech pathology, but I didn't have the prerequisites. So I took them and applied again a year later. Except this time, I didn't get in to any of the schools I applied to, even the two I had gotten into before. Besides, I'm not even sure I have the drive or passion for speech pathology. I have an undergraduate degree so I should be able to get a job, right?

Well, I graduated two years ago and I have no job experience. I can't apply to school because I have no references (you need three).

The only bright spot in my life is my boyfriend, but he's unemployed too. He never graduated college so his earning potential is limited. 

I'm twenty-five and I feel like a failure."
I HATE my summer job,"I'm a college student working at a local pizza place.  I'm doing deliveries and I'm *supposed* to be washing dishes.  At first it was fine, I went from working McDonalds to this place and it seemed like anything was better than that.  I was told I'd be making 6.00/hr plus tips and working full time.

The first couple of weeks, that's what happened.  I did exactly what they wanted me to - washed dishes, ran deliveries, often made out pretty well in tips (maybe 50/night on the weekends).  The thing is that it gradually dawned on me that I'm not being paid 6.00/hr, but they pay everything in cash under the table so I have no way to report it.  Meanwhile, they reduced my hours and I no longer work any of the lucrative shifts.  I'm now just barely making enough to pay for gas money for each of my shifts (they don't pay mileage and they ask me quite often to go to the wholesale warehouse in my tiny Hyundai Sonata to pick up large orders).  I'm making something like 4.00/hr without tips counting towards anything but my job.   I don't even know when I work until the Sunday before the week starts. I'm asked to stay on call on all my days off and if I don't take their call I can expect to get chewed out when I get back.

When I go in to work, I'm berated constantly for being lazy and stupid, despite the fact that I'm confident that I wash dishes just as quickly as anyone else who works there.  Lately, my managers have actually been getting angry at me for doing dishes.  They say it's ""common sense"" that when the managers look busy, I should be standing by them helping them directly (although they told me from day one that I should never stand in the area they do because I get in the way).  The kinds of things they expect me to know how to do I was never trained for, and yet I lack ""common sense"" when, for example, I don't know their recipe for dough off the top of my head, or don't know how to operate a machine with a blade because no one ever took the time to show me what the each of the buttons do.  They make fun of me for asking people not to put knives in the water while I'm washing dishes where I can't see them, even though I've nearly cut myself on a couple.

I don't let it show when I'm there, I have a reputation for being serious (which is true of me outside of work too), but I'm constantly in a bad mood.  My managers alternately make fun of my ADD and speech impediment, tell me I'm too straight laced (I have social anxiety disorder), and yell at me for doing specifically what I was told to do.  I want to quit.  I hate it there.  I'd very gladly take McDonalds over this, because at least there people are professional.  I put in the application a month ago and spoke to the manager but haven't heard anything back.  I can't wait until I graduate college and can work a job I actually want to do."
My father just missed his flight to get to my brothers graduation..,My dad just missed his flight to my brother's graduation..He's in CO and we are in VA and I'm sure it's impossible for him to make it here before tomorrow. I barely get to see him so I'm just kinda sad and frustrated right now. He was supposed to get here today and take us out I even woke up early and got ready and I turns out he may not even get here at all. I'm pretty sure my brother is frustrated at this also..just not sure what to think of this..
My sister never uses her laptop,"So me and my sister both have computers. The thing is, she never uses her own. She is constantly using mine because she complains that her computer doesn't receive wi-fi too well. Sure, I let her borrow it from time to time, but sometimes when I'm using it, she'll ask to use it for an hour or something to: play music, talk with her boyfriend over Skype, watch a movie. And sometimes I'm like ""Sure."" I do something else, and then when I come back to her, she is browsing the internet. I'm like wtf, give me it back if you're done with it, and she is like ""Just one more second."" Just recently she asked to use it to Skype with her friend for an hour, and I really just wanted to relax and use it, so I said no. She doesn't care, she keeps begging, making accusations that I never do anything for her, saying she won't do any favors for me. Then SHE gets super upset with me. I'm feeling extremely guilty right now, but I also feel like I made a sensible move. I just hate how she begs, gets super upset, and then makes me feel guilty or uses tricks to try and give her my laptop when she has her own. I'm sure it isn't completely unusable, and honestly if she wants to use a better computer she should just get a job and save money to get one (she is 21). I really just want to know if I'm doing the right thing, I don't want to be a douche bag but Ive had it up to here with this."
In a LDR and BF said he cheated.,"Like the title would lead you to think, I'm in a king distance relationship. I have been since around early December. He lives in Canada and I live in the US. He's really good for me and I'm his ""dream girl"". This morning he told me that during new years he was at a party and he had a friend who was struggling with addiction. He explained it to me as she was gonna go off and do drugs and die if he didn't have sex with her. He said he didn't feel bad about it until last night when we were talking about him coming for a visit.   This was not too long after us making it exclusive. Am I right to feel upset? This is my first relationship. And yesterday I ""broke up"" with my best friend of six years because she wasn't treating me right and it took me that long to realize it. 

I don't know what to do in this situation. Many of my friends I talk to are online and I met them through him. I told him I needed time to think about what's going on. But I'm angry. And I wonder if im right to be angry."
I just found out that my niece has been doing heroin.,"Some backstory. I have four older sisters and my niece is the daughter of my oldest sister Julia. My niece Amanda is 20 years old and I just found out that she has been doing heroin. A few months ago my family had suspicions that she had been abusing pain pills. She had been asking one of other sisters ""Tara"" for pain pills to help with the pain for her knee, she had injured her knee in basketball and needs to have surgery. Tara was beginning to get worried because it was happening more frequently and she asked Amanda what was going on and Amanda just got upset. She denied that she had a problem, so Tara told her that is going to talk to Julia. Amanda then told her mother that Tara is lying and assured her that she only asked for pills a couple times because of her knee. Julia just doesn't want to believe that her baby girl needs help. So fast forward a few weeks and Amanda's boyfriend talks to Tara that he worried about Amanda because now she is crushing her pils and snorting them. Tara tells him that needs to talk to Julia but he was afraid that she wouldn't believe him and he would lose Amanda. That was the last I heard anything until this past Thursday morning. My sister Sarah called me to tell me that Amanda had admitted to Julia that she has been doing herion the past couple of months. I guess Tara and Julia had heart to heart conversation after Amanda's boyfriend talked to Julia. After they talked and Tara just stressed how worried she is about the path Amanda is going down. Julia then started watching Amanda more closely, Amanda was acting differently and was asking people for money multiples times a day for a couple days so Julia asked her what is going and Amanda confessed about her heroin addiction. She has agreed to go to rehab. 

I just can't believe that my niece has gone down this path. I am more disappointed than anything because she is a smart kid who made a really bad choice. Now this choice has made her an addict at the age of 20 and that is something that will have to fight for the rest of her life. I fee l like she has ruined her life and she has a long and hard battle ahead of her. I just wish that someone had said something sooner or forced Julia to see the truth, maybe this could have then avoided but then again if Amanda was hanging out with druggie friends before she starting popping pills then she might have made the decision either way. 

Sorry for the long and probably jumbled story, I had a lot to say. "
"I was just fired from my new job, I'm reeling and don't know what my options are.","**Short version:** 

I left my previous job to start with a new company in a totally new industry.  I was learning a lot but for complicated reasons my boss became either impatient or outright sick of me and just fired me on the spot this afternoon.  I absolutely did not see it coming, I was never given any serious warning or given any indication I was on thin ice.  I've never been fired, laid off, asked to resign, or pushed out in any way.  I'm embarrassed and angry and feeling helpless.

I've only worked for this place for about 2 months, so I don't qualify for NYS unemployment, in both earning and time employed.  I have bills to pay and I don't have a backup plan.  I really have no idea what to do.  I can get my ass on craigslist ASAP but for the moment I'm kind of shaken up about it and can't even begin to think about what to look for.  A few hours ago I was making plans, now I am thinking about how to keep my car and cell phone.

**Long crybaby version**

I was making decent money driving a truck around NYC.  I clocked around 68 hours a week and the grind of it really wore me down.  A friend who works for a performance shop knew this job was killing me and referred me to an opening at an affiliated business.  I only had basic car knowledge, I can change oil and put in new brakes, but not much beyond that.  However, they were willing to train and my resume was like pornography for this particular position.

I'm pretty well spoken and got the job without even an interview, just after meeting the manager and talking while I filled out the application.  After the first week the boss was still rosy on me, I was learning the cars really quickly and getting along great with the other guys.

Being new to the industry made me a perfect candidate as scapegoat for when things went wrong.  I made a few mistakes in the early going.  My boss is a flawed guy and had a lot on his plate, and made his fair share as well.  Some were 50/50, but instead of arguing with him about who was at fault I usually just tried to solve the problem and move ahead.  I just figured this was new-guy treatment and he would trust me more as I continued to get better.

And I did get better.  The boss scheduled a long awaited day off in May and I was gearing up to fly solo for a day.  I made myself valuable by going through his backlogged merchandise and freeing up money tied up in obsolete or slow-moving inventory.  I was assertive, positive, well liked.  He told me '...when I put you on commission..."", ""...when I can get you ordering our inventory..."" like he had plans to keep me.  I made my own plans accordingly.

Over the last few weeks I was starting to feel like he was beginning to resent me or trust me less than before.  A couple more mistakes happened and he would always jump to conclusions and blame me.  I'd quietly and respectfully point out my innocence in the case but he would typically just be pissed off and not want to talk about the details.  He is the type of guy that will get in 'a mood' and you can never be right, just stay out of his way.

Today, I was driving the company car (it's wrapped and our company name is written on giant letters on the side) when some guy starts tailgating me.  I ignore him.  He pulls up along side and starts gesturing at me.  Don't care.  We get to a red light and he rolls down the window and really starts letting me have it.  I'm driving too slow, I cut him off, I really have no idea what he's talking about.  I don't engage him, I just say 'Relax dude.  Take it easy.  Relax"" He calls me a faggot and peels out.  When I eventually get back, bossman takes me outside and just says 'You're done.'  There was no argument.  

I tried protesting but he literally walked away from me.  Said there is no discussion.  I haven't even explained to him my side of the story, because his mind is made up already and the road-rager calling him is his perfect excuse to pull the plug on me.  Anything I said to him following that was met with ""I don't care dude, I'm done, you're done, that's it.""  

I wanted to read him the fucking riot act and explain, in great specificity, how all these mistakes he's holding against me were his doing.  But this is a guy who won't even hear what I have to say, so I just got my stuff together, said goodbye to the guys and left.

I plan on going in person and speaking with the owner on monday.  Not to beg for my job (I'd love to keep working for him but now the relationship with his manager is completely broken), but to just tell my side of the story.  For all I know this maniac told my boss I was cursing at him, swerving, who the hell knows.  I don't want to throw my boss under the bus and tell him how incompetent he is or how he made me a straw man, I'm just so incredibly frustrated that I could be cut loose without even getting to defend myself.

So what the hell do I do now?  I am making WAY less than I did at the driving job, but I was okay with it because we spoke so much about more money and responsibility.  That low wage and short employment window means I don't qualify for unemployment in NYS.  I have bills to pay and my savings are depleted as I was tapping it to cover myself until my raise at three months, which was coming right up.

I feel totally humiliated and taken advantage of.  I have no idea what I'm going to do.

I apologize for run-on sentences and inappropriately-placed-hyphens, I've never been fired or even been in serious trouble at any job I've worked.  It's a bizarre feeling and my mind keeps going to being a bitch, curl up in bed and cry like a baby, or jump off the roof and not worry about anything.  I'm not actually considering suicide but I fucking feel that way right now.

My relationships been rocky and now my girlfriend blocked me on instagram and wont text me back. I dont know whats happening.,Edit: she broke up with me right now
My sister feels we are trying to ruin her life,"I am not going to bother you with the whole story, i could even write a book  about it. The thing is that my sister has made some really terrible life choices, is Broke,  cannot support her child, the man he is married to is good for nothing -literally: not a good husband,  unemployed,  has no intelligence nor good looks, etc, etc- and me and my parents have being supporting her family for over a year and the thing is that when we talk to her so she can have a guide to make better decisions she just feels that we are trying to ruin her life. She gets mad and wont listen, but the instant she needs help because of the outcome of a crappy choice she calls us and we fix it. EVERYTIME. And if we give her a piece of advice she just takes it as an insult or something.
Today i couldnt stand it anymore and I yelled to her and said really mean things. I feel like crap and i dont know how to show her that we really want to help. I am really mad at her, also..."
Is it normal to wish you were born in more interesting times?,I sometimes feel like I was born in more or less interesting times. As a kid growing up I read a lot of science fiction stories as well as watched a ton of sci fi TV shows. So I have expected that life in the future or 20 years from now would be different or almost unrecognizable than today. I am sad to say that I am in disappoint with how life has evolved. I sometimes dream of living in Sci fi universes like Star Trek or Star Wars just living an awesome existence in one of those universe. It seems like life in the real world is not that interesting and living a life in science fiction would be more exciting than here. Is this just me or do other people have these kinds of fantasy?
I wish I could truly hate everyone,"People tend to be fucking assholes. Either that or I'm so paranoid that I interpret innocuous events as personal attacks on myself, which is pretty likely. Either that or I just naturally don't get along with others.

If anyone is even a little rude, I tell them to get fucked. I spent a good part of my life trying to be good to people and getting fucked over again and again, so if you think it's okay to just start treating people badly I'm going to tell you 

Fuck, I don't know where I was going with that. It seems even more paranoid and self righteous than it did in my head. I'm not some crusader for justice. I'm someone with a short temper and I'm just frustrated with the world.  I want to believe that I'm enlightened and better than everyone else but I'm part of the problem too. 

I don't do well socially is all I wanted to say. I can never tell if someone is just being sarcastic when they say something good about me. I can't hold a normal conversation because my train of thought is so fucked up and convoluted that nobody can understand what I say.  And when they can't, I get frustrated and tell them to go fuck themselves.

The worst part is that I feel guilty. I don't want anyone to suffer. I just can't handle people myself.

I like her so much but I feel like shit,"Potentially relevant facts: I'm 16 years old, I'm male, I live in Sweden, I've never been in a relationship. She's 16 years old, she's female, she lives in Sweden, she has been in one relationship.

I'm extremely into a girl. I've liked her since October and hanged out with her since January. I value every second I'm with her. Only two times have I hung out with her only. (+ Three times with her and a mutual friend.) The first time was a month ago, we watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and it was just generally a great night. 

Today was the second time we hung out only her and I. We had planned to have a West Wing marathon at my house. On valentines day I was messaging her and I said I didn't like valentines day (I immediately regretted it) and she asked why. I told her it was a boring story she didn't want to hear but she insisted she wanted me to tell her. 

(Basically it's: I liked a girl, she liked my friend, he liked her, I got them together, got depressed, they ended it, my other friend likes her, she liked him, they got together, I got depressed again, finally got over it.)

I told her that I'd tell that story during the West Wing marathon if she remembered to ask me. And she did. I didn't know what I was hoping for.

I told her the story, she told me it sounds like it was sad. She asked if I had liked anyone since. I wasn't prepared for the question but I didn't want to say no, I didn't want to say ""Yes I like someone now."" either so I just stumbled on my words. She probably didn't notice but I felt awkward and just kind of said ""Mmmhmm, yeeeeah. I mean kind of. I-"" Something like that. She said ""Okay"" as if she thought it was an odd response. I went on to ask her how it was to be with the guy she was with before. She told me they were more or less dating for 6 months but they were actually only together for one month. She ended it because all they did was make out (Maybe I'm just a soft idiot but I didn't want to hear that. It made my stomach tense and anxious.) and never really did anything. 

We talked a bit about relationships and she didn't really say she doesn't like anyone right now. She just said something like ""Now I just-..."" and she didnt end the sentence (of course I'm thinking way way way too much about this). I'm genuinely not sure what she meant. She also said that she didn't like if someone had a ""Love speech"", it should be more natural. 

Now, I've never been in a relationship, ever. Talking about this with a person whom I'm extremely interested in was hard. Even considering that she has made out with someone makes me feel bad. And that's no ones but my fault. 

I know this is how a lot of people feel but I'll repeat it because I need to. I wouldn't even consider being with someone but her. It would be unfair towards that person because then I'd like someone else more. She is extremely nice, she'd never intentionally be mean towards someone. I just can't disconnect myself from the feelings I have for her. I can't focus on anyone but her. It's tiring, it sucks and I want it to stop but it wont. I don't want to ruin our friendship because it's the only exciting thing that's happened to me for a very long time. 

But the stinger was for me this night that she said ""It is now easier for me to tell someone that I like that I'm interested."" I just feel like, if she was interested she would have said so. It's not her fault, it's my fault for getting to invested. However it is also too late now.

PLEASE just, comment on it or ANYTHING. I need someone to talk to."
I think the guy I was starting to fall for is either bipolar or has borderline personality disorder...,DELETED
Failure to reach my dreams on Japan.,"All of my (IRL) friends knows that I am obsessed with Japan. I studied the language for 4 years; have learnt as much as I can about the history (mostly the Heian period onwards); am the go-to guy for answers my friends have about Japan; things like that.

* Straight out of University, I applied for the [JET](http://www.jetprogramme.org/) and was turned down.

* I went and got myself a job teaching, and after 2 years re-applied and got turned down.

* < A couple more attempts at different applications, organisations and scholarships in here >

* I applied for a scholarship to studying at a Japanese university in 2012, and got turned down.

* I applied for a different scholarship last year, and got turned down (I received the letter today).

There's a certain point where this becomes pathetic and I'm afraid that I've reached that point. I don't want to give up on my dream of living and working in Japan, but I'm sick and tired of putting my life on hold while I wait for the response from some scholarship or organisation or other.

Plus, there's only so much rejection that a person can take, ya know?

I don't want to let my dream die. I really want this, but I keep getting my ass handed to me, and the feeling of being a loser is being amplified more and more, each time.

I just feel like dreams and goals are things that others have, and that I'm supposed to wallow in mediocrity at this point."
This 17 year old I know just got pregnant,"I just wanted to vent about it here,  Maybe if you want to offer your two cents that's fine too. 
But she posts all these pics of herself on FB and then all these guys are like.. cutie, you so fine, aw girl yeah, so sexy! and all this other crap. 
But the post where she is announcing her pregnancy, and only 1 out of the 25 comments are from guys. But where did all the guys go? I want her to learn a lesson, but I'm no longer a big part of her life..
It just pisses me off to think that she's strutting around. A girl with a good head on her shoulders, or so I thought. Blah!!"
I'm not sure my new job is such a good idea...,"First off, a bit of background... I was unemployed for almost a year, until I finally got called back from a place. The thing is... It's a call centre.

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing inherently bad about call centres. It's just that I'm so incredibly nervous talking to people. I find it really difficult to talk with people I don't know.

I finished my training stuff last week, but tomorrow I start my first full shift actually on the phones and I am terrified. 

I'm also really worried I'm just not going to be very good and that I'll end up just losing my job anyways. I'm considering leaving because I really don't think I'll be able to do it, but this is the first job I've had in almost a year so I really can't afford to do that.

UPDATE: So I did my first real day on the phones yesterday. It was a bit of a disaster. I felt like I knew nothing (although luckily for the first 2 weeks on the phones we have extra support because no one knows what they're doing this early on the job). I also am having a bit of a tough time distancing myself from the people calling in, I need to get a thicker skin and grow a bit of a backbone because people yelling at me is starting to get to me after just my first day. 

Well, I'm off to day 2 now. Wish me luck."
I feel I'm losing touch with friends and depression is getting worse.,"I have someone who I call my best and only realy life friend. I don't know anymore. It's starting to seem he only hangs out with me for my things. It's shitty. It wasn't like this ~6 months ago. Anytime I tell him I got something new he'll ask to come over and he will do nothing but pay attention to that. I got a PS4 for Christmas and told him about it. ""I should come over!"" Well, the PS4 got the blue light of death (Odds of that, right?). I told him that and right away he texted back ""I can't come over I'm busy."" Fuck you then. 

Now anytime I text him if he wants to visit or he can come over it's ""You can't sleep over. Mom has work."" ""Im busy sorry man."" ""I'm not feeling good maybe tomorrow."" He's my only friend but he has to go. Without him I feel lonely as fuck. 

I'm not talking to some of my skype friends too much either. I met this guy my age from Europe over a year ago. I learned so much from him that has to do with computers. We haven't been talking to eachother much of lately I don't want to lose him either. I met another guy on skype around 8 months ago. We live 5 hours away from each other. We made plans to see eachother sometime when either one of us gets our license. We have a lot of the same interests. Hes my hope for a new friend. I hope we can meet one day.

During summer my depression wasn't that bad but some events that happened at the end of summer worsened it and it's getting worse. I'm getting bad grades. I regained most of the weight I lost during the summer. All I do is sit around and tune everybody out. I put on my music or play video games and do nothing productive. I feel like a piece of shit everyday. I feel like crying myself to sleep everynight. I want to get better but I don't want to tell my parents because I doubt they would care."

College Admissions.,"I learned that got rejected from a school I applied early decision to this afternoon. It has around a 6% overall acceptance rate, so I was never terribly optimistic in the first place, but I really fell into the delusion that they would accept me. I'm honestly not upset about the decision itself, but rather I'm a bit angry with myself about how I'm at peace with this. The reality is that with this rejection I need to take the next two or three weeks to write the remainder of my college applications and do well on my finals, but it's just not sinking in quite yet. I know I need to finish this semester strong, but it's honestly hard, especially when I counted on my acceptance as almost insurance for the remainder of the year. I don't need to hear that I'm still a strong student, because I am proud of my standardized testing and the culmination of my four years of high school but I'm a bit at a loss for words right now. Life feels like it's is at a standstill, or at least that's what I want it to be. I don't really know what I'm trying to express here, but I just want to get it off my chest. Maybe I'll write something more coherent another day. "
He is leaving.,"He is a friend, so I have no right to feel this busted up about him moving away.  It is a tough one because I am in a long-term relationship with a man I absolutely adore.  I never thought I would have my head turned again.  I was settled and content.  This guy just swept in and shook up everything.  We shared books and music.  We shared thoughts from the silly to the profound. Nothing untoward ever occurred, just the nebulous feeling that something could happen.  Now, I have to watch him go and try to fit back into the world that was here before he came.  "
"My roommate is pregnant and in jail. Now I'm home alone with her boyfriend, who I hardly know.","This is suuuuch a long story so there may be a wall of text. Bare with me.

So I'll start with this. My pregnant roommate is E and her boyfriend is A.

We met A when E and I first moved to Idaho from California. He was quiet, shy, but really cool. So fast forward until about two months ago. E and A start dating and he tells her that he had a malignant tumor removed from his testicles a couple years back, making it hard to produce children. E has ALWAYS wanted kids, but she accepted it and continued the relationship. So about 3 weeks ago, I went to go buy a pregnancy test for myself and she mentioned she hasn't gotten her period in over a month, but she wasn't even considering that she could be pregnant, given A's medical history. I bought a 2 pack. One for me and one for her. Hers came back positive, mine negative. Even though she wanted to be married first, she was ecstatic. How could she not be? The guy only had a 7% chance to make a baby, right?

He's sleeping as this is happening, so she goes to wake him up to tell him the amazing news! What does he do? Wakes up, acknowledges her, and goes right back to sleep. For someone that has that small of a chance to get someone pregnant, he sure seemed totally lax about it. 

Next day, he starts to seem more excited. Maybe he was just tired. Whatever. 

Recently, he's been giving E a lot of shit for staying in contact with her ex husband. Totally acceptable. She still talks to him for multiple reasons. He is the one person that knows her best in this world, and he has being seeing a therapist due to his military related PTSD and she wants to make sure he's doing okay. They don't talk often.

He has threatened to leave of she doesn't cut him out of her life. She tried explaining that she would like to ween herself off him, because he has always been her best friend. A has threatened to leave her, pregnant or not, multiple times. 

So today, I got a Facebook message from someone that has deleted their profile, so it just said ""Facebook User"" with no picture or anything. This is what it said:  

""Tell your friend. (E) to check her messages in the OTHER folder I sent her a very informing message.. or better yet you send it to her if you care about your friend.

Just to let you know [A] has a kid he prolly hasn't even mentioned to you.. he hadn't mentioned to me neither. He is a pathological liar and most of the things that comes out of his mouth are nothing but lies.. he is what? 30 now and has accomplished nothing and you seriously need to get Tested for Hep B and HPV im just letting you know for your babys sake or unless he lied about that too. He is a cheeter and lies to make himself look cool. He prolly even told you he wrote a song about you and its the same song that he sings to every girl.. wich he doesn't play well at all. You will see his true colors eventually girl im just giving you a heads up. All he does is live off of others and cause drama. He even slept with his brothers wife and prolly still does. I was only 17 when we were together and he was 29 but told me he was 22.. keep that in mind. you need to look in his facebook messages so you can see what he has been writing to me saying he is just with you because he doesn't want to be alone and other things... go check it out... His brother was the one who told me about his kid he doesn't even try to see so I contacted the girl and she told me he was running from child support and not once has he seen his daughter but yet he tells people he cant have kids because he has ball cancer wich is a total lie by the way! her name is lauren magby if you want to look her up and ask her about it. 


give her this message please!! thank you! (:""


So, naturally, I tell E about it. 

Long story short, they fought and he grabbed a knife and threatened to kill himself, blah blah, he trie to take her laptop from her so she pushed him. Then when she read Facebook messages of him blatantly flirting with other girls that were sent TODAY, she threw a styrofoam cup of coffee at him and now she's in fucking jail. He officially moved in about 2 weeks ago, so I just have to deal with him...and I can't believe a fucking word that comes out of his mouth now...  

Edit: Also forgot to mention, I have extreme confrontational anxiety. But when a knife became involved, I went in to where they were (in her bathroom) and said, ""Did I just hear there's a fucking knife involved now!?""

A: ""No""

E: ""Yes, he sitting on it!""

A: Wo cares, I'll only be hurting myself!""

Me: ""Are you seriously implying that killing yourself wouldn't hurt her!?!?""

A: ""She's going to leave me!""

Me: ""Anytime I've heard any mention of anyone leaving, it's been YOU threatening to leave HER! She is fucking pregnant! Man the fuck up!!!"" 
Then I left for work.

Sorry, needed to get this off my chest because I normally vent to E. 

Tl;dr : My pregnant roommate is in jail because of her boyfriend who is my other roommate and I don't trust him.

"I don't care what you think, getting drunk and listening to music is about the only thing I enjoy in life any more. Everything else just feels like nothing at all.","I remember being happy once. It was for a few years after high school. Everything in life was new and exciting. There was nothing but potential, nothing but promise of a future that could be anything I made of it. I was surrounded by friends, surrounded by a great girl who made me excited about life. We were young and dumb and all we did was enjoy ourselves. 

Now what do I have? Well I have debt. I have no post secondary education. I can't afford that right now. Friends? They've all moved away, some of them even have families of their own now. I'm almost 30 in a couple of years. Yeah, I'll slowly crawl my way up to a brighter future. Perhaps one day I'll feel better. Perhaps one day I'll feel excited again. Perhaps one day I won't feel alone. Perhaps one day I'll get better at making new friends. Maybe one day someone will truly understand me, how to love me. I don't know. I hope I make it to that day.

Beer after beer, song after song. I'm getting sleepy. Almost time to pass out. I'm smart enough to know that alcohol doesn't help these kind of situations, but this is the closest thing to feeling anything even remotely exciting. 

Sigh. Time is ticking. I've never much paid attention to the clock, although I always was terrifyingly aware of it's presence. I've wasted so many years. I can't afford to waste any more. I won't waste them any more. But I can't be certain I'll enjoy them. I can't be certain I'll bother with them. It's like my life is like a shift at a crappy job. I stare incessantly at the clock, just waiting for the day to end. 

I want to be happy, but I don't know how to be. I just don't understand it.

I Don't Know if I Should Join this New Fraternity,"Hey all...so this has been bothering the absolute hell out of me. 

I don't think I am a big frat person but I feel like because it is a new fraternity, I can make it cater to the above average joe who doesn't wear boat shoes with a pink shirt everyday. I want to be in the most well respected fraternity if I join one. I want to have one that is full of gentlemen who know how to treat both guys and girls well. I don't care if the person has a differing personality or different values as long as they are selfless and respectful. 

So fraternity life probably isn't for me...but I like the networking, the brotherhood and the sorority girls. And if I can get rid of the things people hate about fraternities in this one, I think that'd be beneficial for myself and all. But that is a lot of work. I have to hope the other guys have similar views. 

The dudes in it vary. Most seem like your average joes, but there are some weirdos and perhaps a couple fratty dudes. That has turned me off because I don't want to be associated with weirdos and disrespectful lames. One dude of course said ""You're a fag"" while we were just walking away from a meeting to someone...and then seconds later a kid whom I know walked by and you guessed it, he is gay. I don't like that s%8t. I am all for morbid jokes about whatever if they are well done...but just calling someone ""gay"" or ""retarded"" etc. is just unnecessary and immature. Girls don't like that and most respectful people don't. 

But hopefully with the good guys in the fraternity and myself, we can make it a great place to be. 

So should I do it?

Some other things: I am in Air Force...so I feel like being a founding father wouldn't be as ""wowing"" on my resume once I get out...they'll just love I have actual leadership experience and actual engineering experience out in the field for the AF. 

It is also 744 the first semester...180 every semester afterwards.

I was also thinking maybe I should just join the school's engineering fraternity. It is more likely that I'll be able to network obviously, it'll be cheaper and lastly...access to past tests for all my hard classes! But obviously it will not be as fun...

I wish I had better friends so I didn't have to consider being in a fraternity really. But I just don't see how I can meet girls and friends in general without it. Let's be honest, it is unlikely I'd like the people in the video games club or the photography club. But I didn't meet friends freshman year that I really clicked with and I am an engineer.

Also, I don't really like partying all that much. I enjoy it if I know the people there...so going to house parties doesn't really work for me which is why a fraternity would be nice. I'd know all the guys and hopefully I'd know some of the girls beforehand.

My nephew just went to the hospital.,"My nephew, nicknamed Gator, just went to the hospital today. For the past few months he's been losing a crazy amount of weight. He's been going to the doctor and getting tests regularly, but they can't find what's wrong with him.

Yesterday, they got the results back of his most recent blood test. They said that it was very inconsistent with his last and he needed to see a specialist in Hershey Medical Center. Now, in this part of the state, if you have to go to Hershey, it's a big deal. They were trying to get him an appointment and all they had was today or the 28th of next month. The doctor told my sister if they waited that long, he might not make it. :'(

So, his appointment was at 11. We haven't gotten word back yet as to what's going on or anything. I'm freaking out. He's 7 years old and down to 38 pounds. He's like a walking skeleton. What used to be an active (almost TOO hyper) boy, is now a half corpse laying around not even eating.

What kind of perplexes me, is that his blood is showing something wrong. Why is he going to a gastroenterologist? I get he's not eating, but I think it's a symptom and not part of the diagnoses. Then again, I'm not a doctor. My first thought was leukemia. And at this point, I'd be happy to know what's wrong.

Just worried sick right now. :("
I keep getting depressed at night,"More often than not, I'm fine during the day. Sometimes not, but generally, it's okay. But then it gets to like 10pm, and I just feel screwed up.
I alternate being depressed, and lashing out at whoever crosses my path. I've said some really mean shit during these times, and I have the memory of just not caring at all. I don't know what to do."
The cracks are showing and I don't know what to do about it.,"
Years ago a therapist told me to write letters to myself when I needed someone to talk to. Well, I am tired of sending them to myself and watching my inbox fill up with my own stupid emails. 
I hurt. A whole lot. And there is no one to talk to. 

There is family I love and a husband I adore but I am the one that they come for help, support and advice not the other way around. 
There are people who I am friendly with but no friend to really speak of. I despise therapists and refuse to talk to them any more. 

I am 32 years old and I keep telling myself to just put on my big-girl panties and keep toughing it through this… but I have no idea how to do that right now. 

I have diagnosed PTSD from a shitty childhood. I have anxiety and hyper-vigilance; I have always struggled with depression and self-harm tendencies. But I have worked extremely hard to make something significant of myself despite the hurtles in my life and, I thought I was past this crap. 

If you met me now you would have no idea who I used to be or what I had to do to become the person I am now. You can barely even see the scars. And that is why I am afraid. 

Things in my life are falling apart at an epic scale and I have reached my limit on being able to handle it all. Last week I cut myself for the first time in 5 years, to me that is scary. I am not some silly emo kid with goth makeup - I started pounding nails into my legs when I was 3 and the self harm got worse from there. If I am low enough to harm like this, something is very wrong.

I recently lost my only good friend, the one that helped me clean up my life. He was the only one I could rely on to help with the darkness and now I have nothing. And I do not mean nothing as in I have nothing nothing. I have people to fight for and that is what keeps me going. But it is imperative to me that the people that I love, care for and fight for have no idea about the hollowness inside me. Sometimes the only thing I have to hold on to is the fact my family and my husband think I am relatively normal. It makes me feel normal, it makes me normal to know they think I am normal. 
I am not normal, nor have I ever been normal.

There is a hollowness in me. A darkness as vast and cold as space and now I have no one to help talk me through it. The cracks are beginning to show and I need to find a way to stop it.

I suppose I have  a lot bothering me right now if I am silly enough to cry on the shoulder of Reddit. but honestly, if I didn't tell someone how much I hurt right now…  

I hurt right now. 

Thank you for listening, whoever you are. I just needed someone to know. "
Cannot escape feelings of isolation,"I have been recently through a period of clinical diagnosed depression, not sure if it is still here but I admit I am doing a lot better than last year 

However, these days most of my thoughts are on why am I so lonely, how can I be not so alone and it is taking over all my thoughts

I have friends, not many but they are there, scattered around my university and home city

But I really really desire a group of good friends that I can be around everyday, I feel so lame and boring going through everyday hanging around the same people and I hate how I don't know how to change it. I want to have all theses adventures and make the best of my university life, but most of my friends are also suffering from their own issues. I feel trapped in a routine. 

Is there a way for me to meet new people, and eventually a group of good friends or is that near impossible? i so am awkward and antsy and it is hard to to out there to find people"
I feel sad,"I'm 16 and I've moved into my new school (The UK education system is a little different). It's been almost 5 weeks now and I haven't made any actual friends. I didn't do anything over the summer, and I'd like to stress the fact that that is really not an exaggeration, I was lonely and bored for the whole long summer. I would have thought that things would have somehow changed, going back to school, but nothing really has. I have no friends and I have these super hard subjects to do and it's really worse than before. I think it has something to do with the fact that I hate myself and everyone is a lot taller than I am (I'm 5 ft 2 ins - i'm a guy). Everything is really bleak and I spend a lot of time in bed now, cuddling up to my pillow. Life has really sucked ever since the start of Summer."
"there is a line between ""can I have some of your food"" & ""I'M EATING ALL YOUR FOOD""","So there is this guy I've been seeing (after yesterday I won't be seeing him again). Anyways, we went to the yearly county fair yesterday, I invited my best friend and her husband so they can finally meet this guy I couldn't seem to shut up about. Lets call him Jim. 

We're having a blast the entire day, then we all start getting hungry. Usually at county fairs here where I live, all the food is deep fried. I'm talking ""death on a deepfried stick"" ranging from deep-fried sticks of butter to Klondike bars deep fried with added whip cream & a cherry on top. He gets a donut covered 2-patty with 2-cheese burger. I go with the traditional mac n cheese grilled cheese sandwhich. My friend and her husband get their own food. I'm enjoying this cheesy heaven melt in my mouth when out of no where, Jim's hands is in my dish. I look at his plate and its gone... WE LITERALLY BOUGHT THE FOOD 3 MINUTES AGO.

At first I didn't mind because he took the side dish of my main meal. So I let it slide... but he kept eating it, and eating it, until there were no more sides left. I'm almost thinking in my head *this fuck-tard better not ask me for the rest of my heavenly cheese sandwich*... but he does... 

""You're not going to give me a bite?""
""No, you ate all of yours and my chips"" 
""really? But it looks so good""
""I know it does, which is why I bought it. Not my fault you ate yours so quick""
""well fine""

And I finished my orgasmic cheesy filled sammich. Out of the corner of my eye I see him, in shock. After last night, I am NEVER going out with him again. Not that I don't mind sharing, but I was taught that If you want someone else's food, you do not stick your fingers in there and start eating. You don't even ask for any either! You either get your own or wait until you are offered. 

Tl;dr Guy I brought to county fair with my friends tried to eat my food along with the food I had in my hand without asking. "
I have a crush on my asexual/aromantic friend and I feel like a bad person about it,"So I've been friends with this girl for about 2 years now and about a year ago I found out that she is asexual (doesn't have sexual feelings towards others) and aromantic (doesn't have romantic feelings towards others) but she's so sweet and I still have a crush on her. And I feel this nagging hope that I want her to somehow change, and I feel like a really awful person and friend for feeling that way."
I can't use public bathrooms.,"I know, it sounds stupid, but it really does bother me.  If I really have to go and I'm nowhere near home, I'll try to pee at work and... it just hurts.  I think I have what's called [Paruresis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paruresis) and I'm just not able to 'let go' and well, pee.  At best, a teensy trickle will come out, but then the person in the other stall will cough or shift their feet, and my bladder will quite literally seize up and it's so painful.  I hate that I can't do this simple bodily function just because another human is inside the room.  

I'll take pity, or advice, or whatever at this point.  And no, I'm not allowed to have headphones, which is the only object in the world, besides my own bathroom at home, that can help me pee.  So I am doomed to suffer, pretty much.  

EDIT:  I don't like doing this, but I should clarify that I'm a lady, so no urinals for me.  Ya think having a closed off stall would be easier, but it's just not :(  "
I got pulled over for the first time. I'm going to be sick.,"So, I realize this is rather inconsequential on a grand scale, but I feel awful and I need to talk to someone.

 I was driving to a babysitting job this afternoon, around ~5:15. I am going down a road that is usually deserted. I imagine I was going about ten-ish miles over the speed limit, but I don't know at this point because the experience freaks me out in my head. I am running late to a baby sitting job. 

Then suddenly... A wild police car appears coming from the opposite direction! Fuck. I hit the breaks, but appearantly he has already seen me. I am about to head in to a set of dangerous curves, so I have no choice to but to continue driving for roughly another half mile until I pull in to a post office. 

I am 16. This is the first time I have been puller over. In my state, a ticket could mean a suspended lisecene till 18. So the officer pulls me over, and asks to see my license. I give it to him, and he recognizes my name. 

He asks if my dad is a doctor down at the hospital. He is. For the record, he is also SWAT and occasionally fire department. So he asks me to call my dad and let him talk to him. So I call him, and the officer tells him I was speeding, and then he tells my dad that ""he can't prove it but I think that she sped up when she saw me turn my lights on"". 

Which is ridiculous because what kind of sense does that make? So he lets me go with a warning thankfully, and I make my way to my baby sitting job. I then call my dad, and we talk. He believes me when I say I in no way sped away, and that we'd talk about it when I got home. I will be home is roughly two hours. 

I am so anxious and nervous I think I'm going to vomit. I don't want to talk to anyone I know because I'm so horribly embarrassed. So, on the off chance the two people I know in real life check my account, pretend this doesn't exist!"
Classic Girl Problems,"For the love of me I cant get a girl that seems really interested in me, go out with me or will hangout with me! I a sophomore in high school and short for my age/grade, ( 5,4 ) Im a decent looking guy, somewhat popular.. social, not that awkward etc.. I cant find a girl for the love of me.. For example right now I kind of have a "" thing "" with a freshman girl and she says she wants to hangout, flirts with me, compliments me but whenever I ask her to hangout she makes excuses and we have never hungout yet and ive tried about 5 times.. Another example was a while ago I was talking to a girl I wanted to go out with, Shes very nice, I talk to her, Compliment her, hint im interested in her but she just doesnt like me and isnt interested... Basically Im just wondering what my problem is? is it my height? Can I not be taken serious? Im I trying to force things? "
My girlfriend of two years broke up with me..,"She just called me at random, said she thought our lives were going different ways then she broke it off.. after two years i get a phone call.

"I have too many filters, and I'm about crack.","I can feel it pressing in against my chest. My most empathetic friend asked if I was okay, but I think I got her to think I was okay.

I have filters. I am gay, I am an atheist, I go to an all girl's school, I am an older sibling, I am a doctor's daughter, among other things. I am privileged and nothing is wrong with my life. But I feel like I'm being undone from the inside out. 

You see, I am never all of these things at once. At school, I'm not gay, and only rarely an atheist. And when I'm a doctor's daughter, I'm only an older sibling and who attends an all girl's school. So I have these 'filters'. And every single filter meshes like a quilt to make the mask I need.

I usually can let loose and not worry about filters, and relax. I didn't realize how important this time was until today. I didn't get to unwind yesterday. I had to be a doctor's daughter, and an older sister. And I didn't get to be gay or an atheist or my own freaking person.

I feel like I have a huge weight pressing against my chest. I have to make it through two more hours before I can think about dropping the act, but I feel like I'm not going to make it. I know I won't, because I always suck it up and move on. But it's pressing on me. I just want to make it college so I can drop at least some of my filters. I just want to be done. "
"I don't know why, but I keep thinking about how I'll react when my parents die.","I'm not sure if I'm the only one that does this. I love my parents and my life would be pretty fucked if one of them died. I feel like I would get depressed for the rest of my life. This also happens when I get them mad at me or some shit and I think ""What if they die today?"" and go apologize. That's nice I guess but then it gets me thinking what I would do when they do die. Or when a friend's parent dies and I think what'd it be like to be him and get sorta depressed.

Wtf brain? "
There's a girl.,"I met this girl, Hannah, from a mutual friend of ours. She is stunning. We have a lot in common and the same interests. What bothers me is that she has a boyfriend. Hannah and I like each other but yeah her having a boyfriend. She told me one day when she came over that he broke up with her. Over some stupid reason ""I'm not getting enough sleep."" We spent the day together talking and cuddling. Friday night I was going to ask her out. I went on her phone for a second to do something for her. As I'm doing it she gets a message from her ex. ""I can't stop thinking about you. I'm glad were together again <3"" I just wanted to go home at that point. I've been up in my room since I got home, only coming out for restroom and food. 

I stopped answering her calls and texts. I don't want to talk to her at this time. "
My life is heading no where fast and i have no idea how to fix it...,"Recently I quit my job at this shitty place because i hated it and I can't go back to college because I can't afford the classes. My parents are increasingly annoyed of my presence because im not contributing as much into helping them pay off their debts and bills, note I got my own debt and bills i have to focus on. They basically are telling me to get a job or in a few months start looking for your own place. 




At this point of my life everything is spiraling out of control with new problems arriving into my life mixing with the existing issues i have to deal with. I have no idea how to get out of this jam."
I don't ever feel wanted.,"It seems stupid sometimes, but I don't ever feel like anyone I interact with actually wants to give me attention or make any effort to spend time with me.

I try not to give myself a lot of time to think about it normally, because it seems like a pretty selfish way of approaching relationships, but I can't help but envy what I perceive other people's relationships being like.

I've actually been with someone for about 7 years. We're very close about our inner selves, we live together, share food, share expenses, share income, fuck, and have a good time. But I still have overwhelming feelings that they don't actually want me. Even the way we got together all seems like it was based on my effort and not really their idea or intent, as in, they just went with it because it seemed nice.

I feel like I try to be very open and friendly, but it always seems like the people I try to make friends with are already too invested in other relationships or hobbies to add me into their time. Any time I try to send texts or call people to spend time together, they hardly respond or they say positive things but never actually plan anything. Then my partner does the same and they get responses and get time to hang out with people. I feel like the only friends I have are friends that my partner made and therefore, vicariously, are my friends.

I don't know maybe I'm rambling too much. Does this make sense? Am I crazy? Did I explain enough?"
"I'm still in love with my ex girlfriend, says my subconscious.","One of my previous posts was about how my lucid dream trigger is my ex, that she is never the main event but simply a cameo, and that I have a tough time getting up the following morning. Well, I decided to do something about it.

I talked to her, just to see why she keeps coming up. I told her I'm over her and that I moved on. All she did was...shrug. She took my hand, and said ""No, you haven't"".

""I'm sorry, darling.""

I forced myself to wake up. I don't want to sleep anymore. And i'm sure as hell not confronting her about this. I don't know what to do anymore...."
"I slightly disfigured my face 8 years ago, but its been bothering me recently.","I'm a 17 year old male. Slightly disfigured my face as a kid when I fell from the top of a couch and fell face flat, causing a bump on the top of my head. The bump has healed and disappeared but it's made my right eye look noticeably different from my left. It's noticeable, but most people wouldn't bat an eye. I haven't had any relationship luck in a long time so I'm pretty sure it's just my mind being insecure and making excuses for myself but it just bothers me. My mind right now is being really stupid filling my head with thoughts such as if my face was more symmetrical how much better would life be and other thoughts. Thanks for reading."
i've gained weight,"so i've been gaining weight slowly.. it's really starting to depress me. two years ago i used to be a uk size 12, occasionally 14 on top because i have big boobs (size 34H), and i slowly crept up to being a 14 overall.. blamed it on being curvy and just shrugged it off.

as well as the ever creeping weight gain, i broke my ankle so my exercise levels have gone from walking an hour or two a day to nothing, plus all the wonderful snacks people have been bringing me had really started to add up. 

my mother called me fat so i thought i'd measure myself and prove her wrong but it turns out she was right and i've somehow become a size 18!

i just wanted to rant about this, my best friend doesn't think that i've gained any weight even though i feel physically sick when i look at myself and can always ""feel"" the extra fat whenever i'm just sat around and i feel disgusting. thanks for listening. :<

edit: thank you all for your lovely comments and really helpful advice, i'm getting out of this funk!!"
I suffer from Bulimia,"I have been suffering from bulimia for 7 years now. at first, It was just some sort of an ""emergency"" kind of thing wherein I dont do it often. because at that time, I was trying to lose some weight. It worked and I became a little thinner but after a couple of years, I got fat again and now I am trap in this vicious cycle of binge eating and purging. I cant help it. I'm really afraid that it might affect my health or something. there are periods where I don't eat much and then all of a sudden I am chugging down lots of food only to puke it later. I cannot help it. I tried stopping it but after about 3 weeks, I did it again. I really don't know what to do."

I feel like I'm seting myself up for failure,"I just got out of the shower and I kind of broke down and I actually want genuine advice from people. I've tried to talk about this to friends but they all do the kind of push away ignore it. Anyways I just graduated high school and High school was everything to me. And not generally in like I loved it so much, I was a quiet back of the room kid a lot of the time. But I relied on high school cause it's all I had, My only social interaction but also I hated High school, I hated the feeling of doing everything everyday and I got really depressed. I just felt like school was the only thing I had and now I'm just living. I have no job because I haven't been able to get my liscenes. I can't get my liscenses because My mom struggles with migraines a lot and you need someone over 25 to drive with and I don't really have anyone else. So i'm trying to get my licenses and also for the summer I plan on visiting my dad in long beach. I just don't know what to do anymore, I have had such a hard time even getting out of bed, I passed school perfectly fine but if im not doing that I'm just on discord, watching movies, lying in bed. I just need help with how to learn to be happy and how to not feel like i'm failiing at everything. Cause it's so hard to get out of bed just to do nothing with my life.

The Haunted House,"Hi everyone, I am writing to tell you about my absurd situation.

In 2004 my parents bought an old house to renovate it together here in Italy, and to live in complete serenity, Unfortunately 10 years ago my father passed away, and 2 years later my uncle (one of my reference figures).

All this has created an economic situation towards my mother who, after 10 years, is taking a rather difficult turn.

It is not possible to sell the house at a price that can cover my mother's mortgage and in addition we cannot afford to renovate the house, which he planned to do together with my father.

The more time passes, the more the house is ruined, mold everywhere, wasp's nests, broken windows, the air conditioners have stopped working etc.

My brother and I are helping out as economically as possible, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be enough, I am 30 years old and I don't feel free to make my own life, all my thoughts and part of my money are sucked into that house, my brother because of the crisis caused by COVID-19 has recently lost his job.

I am hating that house with all my strength, which is taking away sleep and serenity from me.

I am suffering from this problem of huge anxiety attacks and I don't know what to do, there are times that I hope that house is just a bad dream.

It would be nice to be able to get rid of that house and see my mother finally happy in a small apartment she could manage, but i don't know how to do it unfortunally..

I am ashamed to talk about it even with my closest friends, luckily after years I found this subreddit to be able to let off steam.

Thank you very much guys!"
i'm no longer romantic,"hello everyone, this is my first time posting here, i hope everyone is safe and doing good!

I want to quit my job. But I have no idea what to do next.,"I am a 26 year old male who has been working in security for almost 2 years. When I first started it was interesting. But now I am thinking of wanting to do something else. My current job as a security guard is I escort people to their case worker and escort them when they are done. However, half of their department has moved to a new location. Now I usually don't get a new client once every 2 weeks. 95% of the time I just sit up there doing nothing. I often don't feel like I am achieving anything. I also don't like getting up really early in the morning to go to work. Then taking a bus an hour each way. I have been interested in getting a new job. However, the problem is I don't know what I am good at. I don't have that many skills that are top notch or my skills are scattered all over the place. I like playing video games, photography, cooking, science fiction, fantasy, history, and other geeky interest.

This is random but I need to vent somewhere.,I recently came across this video on YouTube where this girl eats food and talks about crime. Idk weird stuff but I’m into it lol. One of the videos explained the crime that was in the new “don’t fuck with cats” documentary. I decided to read through the comments and accidentally came across a comment where someone explains how this man killed these innocent kittens and my heart broke. I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m dramatic and extremely sensitive towards animal abuse. I read this comment a week ago and it’s still bothering me 😭 to the point where I watched a random tik tok video (I won’t go into details but it wasn’t even a bad video) and it triggered me into thinking about these kittens. I don’t know why??? I guess I just don’t get why people hurt innocent animals. But does anyone else react to sensitive situations like this?
I just want to know why,"That’s something that’s been bothering me for years. Every time I have emotional breakdowns and meltdowns; my train of thought tries using logic so that I can at least understand and help myself. I ask myself why am I like this, and naturally my mind responds that it’s the childhood trauma that drilled into my mind a depressing and anxious view of the world (or so my old therapist said. It’s very hard for me to admit that I even had “childhood trauma” because I was always reminded that *other* people have it worse.) 

I still question why. Why would someone look at a 9 or 10 yr old, freshly moved out of her mom’s care, and get so angry at her over losing track of training bras or running out of clean clothes that they slap and squeeze them in the face? 

Why was I later yelled at for “creating marks on my face to make me look abused” when I didn’t? 

Why were things like not keeping my backpack and room clean met with shouting and my book bag thrown on me while I tried to sleep?

Why is it that when I tried telling them (both my guardian and the counselors at school) about being bullied, absolutely nothing was done to stop it, rather, I was the one sent to another room to “speak with the guidance counselor”?

Why were my attempts at reaching out and telling others that I was depressed... ignored? Treated as if they were my own fault? My first suicidal thought was when I was 10.

Why is it that I was damn near rewarded for keeping quiet about it all? I remember that any time I was hit that morning, I didn’t go to school. We’d later go out someplace to eat after both of us “calmed down.”

Why was it that I had needed glasses since MIDDLE SCHOOL, but I was actually faking it. Even when the doctor said I failed my eye exam, to look at me dead in the eyes and say smugly, “Ya know, you’re not supposed to lie on those exams!” When there was *NO REASON* for me to lie.

There’s more I could add. But most importantly, why is it that if that happened to any other child that I wouldn’t hesitate to call it abuse? Yet I struggle to call my own aunt abusive; she *has* done a lot for me.

I hate how badly I struggle with my emotions now as an adult. I feel robbed. That maybe I never deserved a good support system or anything. I look at pictures of me when I was around that age and I keep telling her that she didn’t deserve it. Maybe it’ll echo into the past and I could finally heal like I always wanted.

Anyway, thank you to those who read."
Feeling like the ugly sister,my sister has always been the attractive one. I had to be the ugly one with the nasty genes. No man will ever want me. I have this nasty fat nose and bad eyelashes. I also have these nasty ass fat genes. I'm tired of people lying to me saying that I'm thick when I'm just fat. I've Always been shorter and uglier than my sister. Even my youngest preteen sister said my sister was cuter. And the attractive sister said that she was the one with the looks while I just had the hair. My brother always treats her better including his friends. Even my family treats her better. My cousin's are more nicer to her and they treat me like shit.That coo all over her while they including my brother said I was nasty and discussing. People always tell her she's pretty while I've never been told that. I hate that I was born like this. I'm just disgusting.
I try to be a good person but I'll never be enough,"I feel like my life is just a series of huge mistakes that result from my character flaws. The first was from jealousy, the most recent from uncertainty/fear of commitment/being unconfrontational. I don't deserve my wonderful, beautiful, pure boyfriend for so many reasons. Even after I make these huge mistakes I do learn from them, but then another big one will come along in a totally different field. I already hurt my boyfriend with my most recent one and I'm afraid I'm going to hurt him again. He keeps telling me that it's okay, that he loves me, that I deserve him, but I'm so scared. I can't afford to fuck up again. I really try so hard to be a good person. All I want is to be worthy of him. I want to be kind enough, funny enough, smart enough, but overall just good enough. He has never sparked these insecurities himself but I am just so afraid of losing him. God I love him with all my heart and I never want to wrong him.I hate hate hate myself so much. I feel like I'm barely worthy of living. Plus I'm ugly and getting fatter by the day so there's that too."
In love with fictional character,I'm in love with a fictional character but of course the character isn't real.... How can I make it feel like that I'm in a relationship with that character? Because I cry every day that he isn't real. Would making a doll of him help? There's sadly no body pillow of him because he isn't a popular character (I know I'm one of those weird people but whatever. Nobody is perfect)
People who cant entertain themselves.,"I live in a house with other adults and it just really reminds me how annoyed I get with people that cant entertain themselves.  They consistently come up to me and say what are WE doing today, or I'm bored. I do like to hang out with them, I mean I liked them enough to agree to live with them. Its just I dont want to always hang out every waking moment. And I'm trying to work in my studio on my art but I consistently keep getting knocks on my door asking what are we going to do?  Do these people not have interests?"
How can I find my people? I don't feel like belonging anywhere.,"So the problem is that I've been noticing I have very little or sometimes nothing in common with the people I hang out with, especially at work. I am an intern at the company I work, so I hang out with other interns, but I feel like I have nothing in common with them AT ALL. They like to talk about parties, boys, relationships and I am not very interested in those subjects, and also they are very loud. I am very calm and quiet and a  few years older. there are actually some people I would like to hang out at work which I consider to be a little more calm and with different subjects to discuss, but I don't know how to approach them. I used to work with a few of them before but I always feel like I have nothing to say to them either. 
How do I find my people at work and also in life? I am very shy and introspective so it's really hard for me to start a conversation."
Men who define masculinity by stereotypes are the most pathetic people on the planet.,"Beer drinking, sports watching, cat calling, blue collar jobs, cigars, poker, hatin' queers, bar fights, huge steaks, giant trucks, and slammin' hot chicks.

Literally none of these things make you masculine. They make you a tool, because you're letting somebody else dictate your identity to you, usually advertisers. 

These people spend their whole lives living in the boundaries of ""If you don't do **X**, you're not a REAL MAN and I'll fuckin fight you!""

Just be yourself, for fucks sake. "
Maybe I have no ambition and that makes me feel a big piece of shit,"Well the fact is that I don't feel ambitious. I don't want to be an important manager or CEO of a big company. I currently work at a big company as an intern, and even as an intern I am already working my ass off, I feel like I am too calm and slow for that environment, I am very introvert and most people who work there are very fast and extrovert, sometimes I just don't fit in, but working there is a big opportunity for me to grow as a graphic designer, but I am not shure if I can handle it, sometimes I feel like I can't get along with it. I cry almost every day and feel anxious. I have to be creative all the time and sometimes I feel so exausted that I question if I am really going to be happy as a graphic designer. Sometimes I just want to work at a calm and peaceful place but I don't think it does exist. I just want to overcome this and get my shit togheter without having a breakdown. Don't know what to do. "
How Fast Life Passes,"Hello, reddit! This is my first time posting. I know that this will probably be ignored or whatever, but, ehhh that’s alright. Anyway, What really bothers me is how fast life’s going. I mean, it seems like yesterday we were children, and now we’re young adults then pretty soon we’ll be in our thirties and then so on, and then we’ll die. I think this is the doing of my anxiety. (I have been clinically diagnosed with an anxiety disorder). If not, please tell me I’m not the only person who’s freaked out about this."
My dog has cancer :(,"We just found out last week my dog (11yr old husky mix) has cancer . A mass between the pads on his paw came back cancerous . There is never a good time to hear the word cancer ,but right now it's even harder. My dad has been out of work and fighting a car accident claim that left his back pretty messed up and he does manual labor for a living, my mom is on a fixed income and going through all kinds of medical issues herself . We just lost a dog last year ( had him put down as he was pretty old and had no quality of life left) .
This dog is my baby I've had him since he was old enough to leave his mom, he has saved my moms life a few times and he is what helped us figure out she had a brain aneurysm and were able to get it fixed in time. He is pretty much her service dog , and my son loves him to death . I made a GoFundMe to try and help with the cost of surgery but none of my family and friends are donating , I know that sounds horrible but I have always helped these people when they were in need or had a GoFundMe of their own for pets or other things. I'm just frustrated and stressed out on what to do and how to afford this surgery ,and I absolutely can not lose my dog . I'm selling anything and everything I can . Sorry if this isn't the right place to put this I just needed to vent to someone other than my husband ."

I have no one to talk to,"A while back I broke up with my girlfriend of two years because things were falling apart. It sucked, but I was happier than I’d been in a long time and I moved on. 

This girl that I had been best friends with since my freshman year of college and I have been hanging out a lot more since I’ve been single and I fell for her pretty hard. Well yesterday she told me she was worried we were getting to affectionate with each other and she didn’t want us to get carried away and ruin the friendship we have. 

That night we were hanging out together and she kissed me. I told her how I felt about her and that I wanted us to be together, but she said that since we were both about to graduate and she was still waiting to see where she was going to grad school that she couldn’t start something new. 

I understood and I didn’t want to lose her as a friend, but all day things have just been weird. I want to talk to her like we did before but now I feel like I can’t. I just feel alone. "
Cheated on my girlfriend after my friend died,"My friend died earlier this month. I'm traveling in another country and couldn't come home to be with my friends. I've completely isolated myself from them and can't talk about it.

I've drunk myself stupid almost every night since. My girlfriend is amazing, I want to marry her but the other night I was so blackout that I woke up beside a stranger.

She doesn't fucking deserve that. If I tell her, she'll leave me and all of our friends at home will disown me. I'll have nothing to go home to."
Failed my drivers test. Which only made things that much better,"You know when things are not going great (they are not going horrible just not... good ) and you just really, really need a win, you are like: ""This win can surely turn things around!"".

Well I have been waiting forever to take my drivers test to get my license (Did not take it out at 16 because of reasons, Now 20-ish) and today was the day and I failed.

I practised for it (Been driving a while) even got a chance to redo it after practicing for a bit more and still failed again (which only made it hurt that much more), I get to try again in a week but I don't know.
 
When it came time to the test (Backing into a spot) I just locked up: Distances Seemed longer, Spaces got Smaller, Mistakes and over corrections were made and well that was that.

 I'm gonna keep practising but that does not take away from the fact that right now I feel like a total failure and frankly a little scared that I'm just gonna keep failing. In a while gonna go out with some friends try to get my mind off of things "
Break ups are difficult...,"So as the name suggests, I've recently broken up with my GF of about 5 months, it doesn't seem long to many probably, but a lot happened in those 5 months, a lot of things happened and I know for a fact i'm still very attached to her, I still love her, but the thing is the break up was quite drawn out so to speak, over the course of about a couple weeks I guess, I mean It's kind of slowly fading, shes removed everything from social media that includes me and is basically walling me off in a metaphorical sense, honestly not even being able to have a conversation seems really depressing for me, i mean the break up was over the fact we argued over small things for the past 3 months, even if we did forget them it still happened, so that was one of the main reasons, another was the fact we had nothing in common except food, I myself think that's not exactly the best reason just because of different interests, but i think the main reason for her was I was indecisive about things (although I was only asking for opinion, or what she wanted to do), as well as the fact we argued, those were the two main things.

Now come a couple days later, I now am not only having small emotion break downs, I'm also having a loss of appetite and I'm only eating a bare minimum, I'm slowly coming to terms with it, but I'm still feeling pretty bad with more questions than answers so, i'm at least trying to have an actual long talk about everything sometime, I'm giving it time though as I do respect her feelings just in case, as although she did send me a small phrase saying that she no longer cares, I'm kind of questioning that a bit, only because she was talking with one particular person, but in the end, I do respect her choice and I am fine with this mutual break up, kind of.

I guess thanks for reading this, I just thought I need to share this as me sharing this is helping me in a way I guess...

Update: To an extent I have gotten over the idea that we have parted ways, but I can't even hold a conversation, I'm experiencing loss of appetite, to an extent where I only eat a few bite of anything before I cannot, I'm slowly beginning to feel more and more fatigued, with everything thing I do to seem tiresome, I feel useless to anything at all, if someone knows anything or how to deal with this, please, I feel like I'm slowly losing myself"
"My ex had me arrested, but I still love her :(","
Hey everyone, this is my first post here. I really need someone to talk to, but I cannot talk to anyone.

To get everyone up to speed I was in a relationship with a girl for about 9 months. The day I met her was the day I fell in love with her. Yeah it moved way to quick, but love, sometimes is dangerous. The only thing is there isn't a real reason why I love her. I just do. We never saw eye to eye on a lot of things, but we just loved each other. My mind is confused just saying that, but it's true.

She ended up moving in with me about 6 months into our relationship. I didn't want it to happen, but she was getting kicked out of her place so I was going to help her out. The problem is we were always disagreeing and arguing. I personally blame it on our overuse of marijuana. We HAD to smoke to keep our sanity.

I started to see she was bad for me. She lost her job and I was paying all the bills and was working 2 jobs. She complained that I never got her things and always thought I was cheating on her. I always tried to look past that and every day I just wanted to start fresh she wanted to start an argument. There have been too many long nights between us arguing and yelling. I just wanted us to work so badly so I endured the arguing. Everytime I would try to walk away from the situation she would follow me and keep instigating it.

So fast forward to our last month together she kept thinking I was cheating because I was always working. I really was always working and never tried to contact another female. In fact I deleted every girl out of my life on my contacts and Facebook/social media. I didn't even look at other girls in a sexual way ever. My body and mind and soul only wanted her. Well she keyed my car. So I knew that was the final straw and had to be an adult and tell her to move. I told her I am giving her a 30 day eviction and she needs to leave.

Her being jobless and soon to be homeless knew that this wasn't going to end well. So while I was at work she called the police and told them I was beating her. They came to my job and arrested me on the spot. I spent 2 weeks in jail and I am still dealing with house arrest. I am able to work but that's it my life is ruined at the moment. I lost my apartment and she destroyed my things while I was gone. The moment I got out of jail she was blowing up my phone and social media to get back with me, but under the court I am to have no contact with her so I blocked her number and ignored all her attempts to talk to me.

We have only been broken up for 2 months, but everyday she's on my mind about 60% of my day. It's killing me and I think the house arrest is making the problem worse because I can't go live my life. She is refusing to speak to the police so i am in the midst of waiting the 180 days they have to charge you. I am about 70 days in at the moment.

I recently just found out through a friend who saw her at a bar making out with this guy. Who she was around during the time we were together. She's obviously moved on, and I was moving on until I heard this news. The moment I heard it my heart sank and i have this feeling I've never had before. My mind is spinning over it. I want to cry, but I physically can't over the situation. I love this girl, and I don't even know why. It's really killing me on the inside she's already moved on even though she 'loved me so much and still does'. I can't speak to her and tell her anything, and I won't. I don't need or want to go back to jail. I just want these charges gone. In fact I'm not even charged yet. I'm just sitting, waiting.

I just wanted it to work so bad. Everyday I said to myself, it's a new day, let's put the problems to rest and just enjoy each others presence. She couldn't do that. God my soul hurts right now..."
Payed,I see paid spelled incorrectly on Reddit more than any other word and it is driving me crazy. It is not 'payed'.
Broke up with ex-girlfriend of 6 years. Never will get closure or reconciliation.,"I broke up with an ex-girlfriend of 6 years a few months ago. I left her because I highly suspected she was cheating on me. I do not know this for sure, but all the suspicious behavior was there.

- She had stopped wanting to have sex with me. I had asked to start using Condoms because we had a bad close call with an unwanted pregnancy but that's not a good reason for no sex.

- She had started guarding her laptop and cellphone with her life, and would get upset if I even glanced at the screen when she was on facebook.

- We never went to bed at the same time anymore, and all of a sudden she always needed space, she was complaining I was always around.

- I been told that when you confront a cheater, they blow up on you, and my ex had quite a temper and would become very angry that I ""accused"" her of cheating.

- She would accuse me of cheating on her all the time, and I also heard cheaters will do this to cover their own guilt.

- She had been hanging out with this male friend more towards the end, and putting on make-up and stuff, plus working out more. 

To me it seemed she had moved on, and I kind of don't blame her, I had waited too long to confront a trauma disorder issue I had which caused me to quit jobs and break-down a lot.

However, I wish she had been more unfront about it, and until this day she denys she cheated, and I would have been more apt to believe her, and even apologize for accusing but, she never even tried to talk to me about it.

Anyways she texted me today after not speaking for two weeks, and I thought it was going to be the start  of working things out, but instead she told me to stop talking shit about her. I do not even know what she is talking about because I do not talk about her on facebook, with mutual friends or to her. 

If she does come up, its in brief passing. I don't know I am crushed because I really miss the woman, but in the end she still has the same flaws which is the inability to remain calm and solve a problem.

Why I am attracted to her, I do not know, but deep down I miss my best friend very much, our relationship may have been shitty but she was still the person I loved to spend my time with the most.

I just wish she confronted her issues, the way I did mine."
I think I might be depressed,"Little things bother me to no end, my friends dont invite me to play a game and I immediately think they hate me, I leave a conversation and no one tries to talk to me and I think they hate me again,  I'm to nervous and anxious to talk to people and take steps to better myself, I've been told that I am just looking for a reason to moan whilst walking near a road and I considered jumping in front of a car but I know I'm to scared to do it. 

I have no idea who my friends are and I hate everything about my appearance. 

I don't enjoy most things any more and am always bored,  gaming which is something I have always used to take my mind off things is something that I get bored off immediately now

And yet I'm always told I'm the guy that's constantly smiling and blahblah

I'm also to scared to see a doctor or talk to people about how I'm feeling"
I feel so alone.,"So I'm the only one in my friend group that is single (I like it for the most part and honestly I'm not really even looking for a relationship right now) but sometimes I want to just disappear and start over.  I feel like except for my parents then no one would miss me.  

A few days a go a friend had a small get together and invited some people over for drinks and finger food.  When I got there I realized that is was 3 couples and me (7th wheel).  I talked to everyone a bit, but it felt like I had just been invited out of politeness since I'm friends with the host and the 2 other guys in the couples that were there.  I was just setting there, sometimes talking to people sometimes not, and I just felt so alone.  I decided to go for a walk so I left the apartment and walked to a nearby park and just sat there looking at things for about an hour and decided to go back to my friend's to say goodbye and leave, and when I got back no one even noticed I was gone.  

I don't really know if I'm looking for advice or what, just getting this off my chest.  I like being by myself sometimes, I'm an introvert, but when things like this happen I just realize how caught up in their own lives my friends are and how little I show up on their radar. "
Somebody on the street corner outside my window has been playing the bongos for about five hours,i just want it to stop
Please be alive and okay..,"Sorry for language..

What the fuck? No, really, what the FUCK? Six months ago you and I were best friends, and now you're a missing poster on every wall, plastic bag, and all over my Facebook. ""A danger to herself"" with ""Scars up and down her arms, self inflicted"" in the description box.. So many months after she even went missing. I don't know if it was those bureaucratic fucks in the police, or her abusive and neglectful parents but jesus christ.. ""Missing since December 14"" and posted YESTERDAY. Three FUCKING months.. she could be dead you fuckers! Last time I talked to her she was recovering from a schizophrenic attack, anorexia, and bipolar disorder. Hearing all of these people I live around, people we went to school with, people WE knew acting like she doesn't matter. They just go on about their days like she isn't missing.. She might be dead for all I know.. and if by some miracle, you are reading this Cherokee.. Please come home.. even if you go to jail, I want you to be safe. I love you and miss you so much"
Professor made me cry and I feel so discouraged.,"Hello everyone. I'm a 21 year old female about halfway through a vet tech program. It's really, really hard. I had a tough time last semester taking anatomy, chemistry, microbiology, large animal care, and medical math. 

I got a C in anatomy, failed chemistry (technically I got a D), got a B in micro, dropped large animal, and got a B in med math. It was a terrible semester. I absolutely hate being here and it stresses me out more than I can put into words. I don't even like this program anymore. I'm just doing it because I need to graduate college. 

So this semester sucks. I'm taking Parasitology, RATS lab (research animal stuff), clinical physiology, large animal care, small animal care, and a preceptorship prep class. It's a lot. There's a ton of parasites to memorize, I have a TON of essential skills (stuff the AVMA says I have to know and I am checked off on--if I get a Not Approaching (failing grade) and ANY essential skill in ANY class then I automatically fail the class. 

I'm constantly a ball of stress. I did good on my first round of essential skills but I'm falling behind. I missed handing in a few assignments, I have to start a paper for clin phys, I have to practice my technical standards, and I'm not doing so hot on tests. I feel completely overwhelmed.

Today I had my small animal lab. We did some check offs and I decided to put off a few until the end of the semester. My professor says, ""Too bad, you're doing them now"" and I end up with two Not Approaching. I can retry them at the end of the semester but it's like I wasted a chance. 

I don't know any of the dog restraints well so I was going to do them after our week break. I asked the professor to review them with me and when I hesitated she got huffy and said ""Well you clearly didn't watch the videos"" which I DID. She kept berating me and I started tearing up because it was in front of other people. I almost walked out. But I stuck it out and wiped my tears away and practiced. I left and was totally humiliated. 

She made another girl cry too but I don't think I can go back. It was mortifying. It made me hate being here even more. I'm sick of being broke, sick of all this extra bullshit, and sick of being dirt broke. It's killing me. I just want to go home. "
I seem to waste my money.,"I'm 21 and have a monthly salary of £1250 after tax. I pay £5 a month for a phone bill and approx £200 a month commuting to and from work. Even with these low outgoing costs I still seem to have only a few hundred pounds left St the end of every month but I can't seem to work out how on earth I waste this much money. 

I've tried tracking my spending but it's just too much of a pain to be worrying about a few pounds here and there. 

I really want to save up the money to learn to drive and save up for a holiday in the summer but I need a better way of saving my cash. "
I Feel Useless & Utterly Incompetent,"What a rough beginning to the new year. Well to begin I'm helping my mother run and manage our business (flooring/kitchens). Recently or well sort of recently a restaurant that was near us that brought in the crowds to our location and was essentially a landmark of the city burned down in late October. 

It's now January and looks like we're closing up shop. It sucks, both me and my are full time students to top things off and i have a 10 year old brother to look after. Things financially have been tight. Whatever money I've received from school I've given to my mother to help with the rent and bills. It's frustrating coming to a near empty parking lot every morning stay from morning to evening and nothing comes in. Christmas was a drag tried to save up some cash for some small presents for my mom and brother but my mom needed the money more. Now I start school Tuesday and to be honest I'm terrified, stressed and slightly depressed despite myself trying to keep a positive attitude. 

I don't know how this semester is gonna go, I've been applying to tutoring and I've been working on my cover letter & resume in hopes to land a barista position at Starbucks part time at least. Aside from being competent in Office app's I don't think I really have much to offer. I don't know, it sucks I really feel useless I wish I could do more though I'm trying. I don't know reddit I understand it does no good in just moping but I just really needed to get this out there. I appreciate you guys taking the time to read this. "
I didn't get the job,"I'm not surprised, but I wasted a whole paycheck to go out there and interview with them. I'm a horrible speaker, and no one really likes me any way, but they seemed nice enough and seemed willing to work with me. 

I didn't even notice the email until today, so I can't exactly do anything about it. So that's what's bothering me. I'm really considering leaving the field I'm in anyway. "
The roads are bad and I haven't heard from my boyfriend yet. I'm so worried.,"I'm not really sure where to put all these nervous feelings and this just seemed like the right place.

I live in Canada, it's cold, and the roads are sheet ice tonight. I was having a terrible evening. My boyfriend got off work at about 10, and called me, only to listen to me cry and complain that I'm having a hard time. He calmed me down a little, and then said he wanted to make my night better. He said he'd call me when he got home from work so I could vent. Exchanged ""I love you""s, and hung up. He only lives about 10-15 minutes away from his work so I knew I could expect a call fairly soon. It's been two hours and I haven't heard from him. His phone is going to voice mail, and he's not answering texts. I feel like if something happened to him his family would let me know, but I'm so scared nonetheless. Car accidents are always happening this time of year and I'm just so scared."
A girl I know told me she's going to kill herself [fairly long],"The things is, I don't know if I believe her. Before you tell me how cruel that sounds and how awful that is, let me state my case.


So, a few months ago, a started working with this girl in the theater program at my school. She seemed really fun at first, and I was actually really attracted to her. I started giving her rides home, and we'd make out a little bit here and there. She informed me, after a while, that she had cancer, and that she's been receiving treatment her whole life. Leukemia. I was shocked, but was surprised at how chill she was about it. Then we didn't talk about it all that much. The cancer, I mean. I'd ask her how chemo was going this or that day, and she'd tell me it was rough, so I'd try my best to cheer her up.


After a while, she really started to get on my nerves. She started to gossip about me behind my back, and tried to do the same thing with me about other people. That's something I have trouble with, because I've had bad experiences with gossip, and it just pisses me off. So I'd tell her how I felt, and she'd respond with something like, ""Oh you know me...just a nosy girl!"" Then she'd giggle like it was nonchalant. 
She never stopped. She kept on with it, and was always very, very dramatic about everything. She also became extremely hypocritical. She'd claim to be a perfectionist, and then, when I'd ask her o go over lines with me, she'd act very annoyed and say no, we didn't need to do that.


But I still liked her. She was still a lot of fun, and quite nice if you could get past her gossiping issues. SO we kept going with our little fling. And it was fun, for the most part. The only other thing that got to me was that she was always VERY flirty with other guys. But I figured I couldn't be too upset, cause we were never officially dating.


Just last week, I told myself I was going to ask her out officially. The, I shit you not, DAY I was going to, a mutual friend of hers and mine approached me and asked why he heard that I'd been kissing this girl at a party the weekend before. I din't know what to say. I asked him why that was a problem, and he told me he'd been dating her for a while. 


I've been fucking livid the past few days. I haven't answered her calls, facebook messages, or emails. She's been asking and asking me to get in contact with her so she could ""fix the problem."" I said fuck it and have been leaving her high and dry.


Today, I got an email from her that, again, asked me to call her. But then she told me that she'd found out her cancer was terminal, and that she'd probably see her 17th birthday, but that was probably it. Then she told me that she's been telling all her closest friends that she's going to kill herself before it happens, and has sworn them to secrecy.


I don't know if I believe it, because this is the kind of girl who may *actually* lie about something like that. But I do know for a fact that she has cancer. I've been trying to get in contact with her, and am now as well. When I do talk to her...what the fuck do I say? I've been practicing my ""fuck you"" speech, and then she drops this emotion bomb on me out of nowhere. This is a person's life. And her may take it before her time. Do I tell her parents? No? Even believe her? What? I don't know what to do. This is the first time I've ever been in a situation like this. Help, please. "
I Surrender,"TL;DR I got divorced, lost my job, burned through savings, and have completely run out of hope.

Today, I finally called to get help with my bills and expenses. This is the latest stop on an 18 month slide. Go grab a snack...

18 months ago this week, my wife of 8 years, mother of my 3 sons, gave me a letter for my birthday. The letter was many pages long, detailing every way I had made her miserable since the day we met. At the end, she gave me one week to move out of our home, or she would be taking the children and leaving. Meanwhile, she sat in her office and wrote a check to completely pay off her student loan, wiping out our entire savings account.

I moved out, begging for counseling, or at least a chance to understand what she was talking about (many of her examples of my failure to do anything right did not make sense and were clearly untrue).

I took my paycheck and some money my parents had sent for my birthday, found an apartment and enough Goodwill furniture to sit, eat, and sleep.

The shock wore off, she initially set 6 months as the break, then 2 months in I stopped to pick up my kids (I was seeing them almost daily then) and said, ""You're never asking me to come home, are you?"" She laughed and told me how much fun she was having, she had a realtor ready to list our home for sale, and said she'd be filing for divorce. A few weeks later, she followed through.

At this point, a lot of very close friends simply abandoned me. I cut a few off, they only helped make me more angry. I didn't blame them, it was their own shock, hurt, and empathy coming out poorly, but I didn't need more anger. The majority just quit calling, and I didn't blame them either. I wasn't very pleasant to talk to. Not a lot on my mind except this out-of-nowhere disaster. The few conversations I had with friends and family boiled down to, others have survived it and I would too.

Still, all was tolerable. I was still working, still seeing the boys almost daily, and as the first year passed, it actually wasn't bad. I took my tax refund and sent myself on a 10-day vacation to Europe because I'd always wanted to go. I bought a house because she wouldn't allow the boys to stay overnight with me in my studio apartment, and now they could. Our joint custody meant they were with me half the time, and actually a little more than that due to her work schedule.

Then I lost my job. I was told my position was being eliminated and that was that. I had no desire to contest, it was a miserable job, which made me so miserable I am certain in contributed to my divorce. So, I set out for a new adventure, sending out 3 resumes per day to jobs I was well-qualified for or even positions I had held before.

I had managed to rebuild some savings after my trip and house purchase and that got me through 2 months. Then I cashed out the modest IRA I had wisely set up many years before, and it lasted about 4 months. 

Now here we are today. My mortgage payment is a week late, I have a little under half of it. My electricity is due next week, might make it, but the furnace (set at 55) keeps kicking on. I realized last week my car insurance was due 3 months ago, but I let it slide because I can't pay it and eat or put gas in it to go job-hunting.

The divorce is dragging on. I've convinced myself she is stalling until I completely self-destruct, at which point she will demand full custody and move with the children out of the country (we're in the US). 

I have applied to close to 500 positions in the last 7 months, from my old job titles to entry level. I have had several professional job-search helpers and resume assistants. I have done everything every website says, even the ones that contradict the other ones. I have been referred for jobs by contacts within the companies with openings. I have had two interviews. One required me to work every evening and weekend (which translates to no custody of my kids) for $8/hour. The other, I just found out, opted for the other candidate. In total, I've had 4 responses to applications.

I have one friend. Leaving out all the Facebook buddies, who are quick with a Like and a happy comment every once in a while, not actually friends, I have been completely abandoned. I told my mother two days ago that I was scared, she has not replied. 

How and why has everything failed so completely? Hundreds of people I know could have stepped up to do something. They could have talked to my ex, tried to make her be reasonable. They could have helped me with a job. They could have called once. How did I manage to go from solidly middle-class a year and a half ago to food stamps and the beginning of losing my home and losing electricity and the furnace it powers? 

I can't stop thinking about how completely abandoned I am, how many people failed to help when I finally gulped down the shreds of pride that were left and cried out for help. I can't really put my best effort into job searching, because no, I don't believe Mr. Job Coach and Miss Resume Helper that THIS will be the one. I can't sleep because the furnace keeps kicking on and I know it's the last few days of heat. The only thing I do know is that I'm not suicidal because there's still one little scrap holding on that maybe, maybe, there's a way. I just don't want to wait any longer. I'm so tired.

Updated: Somebody added on their prayers or something, I got a great lead today, and I got scheduled for an interview. Not out of the woods yet, and even if I'm hired this week, it will be a lousy couple of months until the paychecks flow smoothly and things ease up, but it's something. A good leap from where I was the other night. I'm trying to stay cool, I can't take another huge let-down, but even this minimal occurance seems big right now!"
So I might have just impregnated my girlfriend...,"It's not entirely a bad thing though. Its just we've only been dating a few weeks. Fortunately she's my best friend and I've known her for 10 years. Unfortunately we played a dangerous game and lost.

I fucked up big time. Mentally we are both ready, financially not. My one (maybe) saving grace is she has internal problems with her eggs. Her periods are irregular and she and her ex were trying to have kids before they broke up. So she might not get pregnant.

And that sucks because I love her. I plan on marrying her in the near future. But she might not be able to have my kids. That sucks because I always envisioned myself with kids. We're almost 30 and its time to have kids of our own. No matter what though, I'm going to see it thru.

We'll see in 4 to 6 weeks..."
I feel like an idiot because I'm not sure where on the trans spectrum I am.,"I have been a transvestite for more than half my life, and I've had transgender thoughts since I was 13/14. These thoughts are always there, obviously some days stronger than others, and I just don't know how to define myself. Am I transgender, gender-fluid, just struggling, or am I just a guy who likes dressing up and using that as a coping mechanism.. 

I welcome, and will answer, any and all questions you may have."
I have no one to talk to. And I don't trust anyone anymore.,"Inspired by [this thread on adviceanimals](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2hivjr/my_friends_sister_just_saved_his_life_she_doesnt/).

1. I am depressed and think about hurting myself all the time. I think about the people who generally don't care about my life, and how maybe they might realize that I really was a person, if I was gone. or they wouldn't and it wouldn't matter anyway.

2. I used to have people I would call when I was in crisis. I moved in with one of these people. We stopped getting along. He, in turn, is friends with the other three people on my list. One day he accidentally forwarded me a screenshot of me having called his phone three times ina  row with the caption ""He's looking for attention again.""

3. When I was 11, I threatened to hurt myself and my parents had me locked up for 72 hours to scare me out of it.

4. When I was 22, My girlfriend and I had a fight before I went to work. When I came home, she had called the police and told them I was depressed and possibly suicidal. She lied to them and told her I had threatened to kill myself during our fight (I hadn't). I was dragged back to the same hospital, the same room, where I was held for 72 hours again.

5. I have had therapists my whole life. Some prescribed drugs. Some said I was uncurable. I stopped seeing them when i turned 18 until I finally got the courage to reach out to one again. We had one session, and then my mother died unexpectedly that week. I forgot about our next appointment and when I did finally call her and told her what had happened, she told me that because I'd missed the appointment I was no longer her patient. I have been frightened of therapists hurting me ever since.

6. This week, while I sat with a kitchen knife in one hand and a phone in the other, I called a friend from my hometown. I didn't tell him about the knife. I told him I needed someone to talk to, and that I felt alone, I didn't know what else to do. I wasn't looking for attention...I was asking for help. He laughed, said that it couldn't be that bad, told me he had to go, and hung up.

7. This week I put something on my facbook feed. I didn't want to broadcast that I was depressed and needed help--I decided to instead express how I felt and hope someone else had those feelings, too. I posted that I felt like what I had wasn't what I wanted, and what I wanted was unattainable. I posted that I felt like a loser, and that I really could use some happiness right now. Someone on my facebook feed privately messaged me and told me that I should quit with the passive-aggressive statuses, because they're not impressing anyone. I stopped putting things on my facebook feed.

8. My greatest fear is being taken back to a hospital and being put in a room, alone, again. I am afraid someone will use interwebs-voodoo and dox me somehow via this throwaway reddit account and when I get home there will be police there waiting to take me back to a hospital. Please don't do this. I am begging you.

9. My father does not talk to me. I told my sister about my depression. She told me that I should just kill myself because my depression was making her upset. My sister has a lot of issues with narcissism and drugs.

10. I have had friends my whole life. Each and every one of them has lied to me. I hold honesty up very, very high in my life...I can't trust anyone because everyone lies to me.

11. I don't want pity. I want the hurt to stop.

I want someone to talk to, but I've run out of people to talk to. I don't know what to do.

EDIT: Even Reddit wouldn't let me post this, thinking it was spam. Had to spend some time altering it so Reddit would accept. WHY. WHY WHY WHY."
i dont want to be here anymore,"I feel so worthless, my boyfriend can't take the responsibility in arguments that would happen and he always tells me everything that I'm doing wrong and when I mention what he does wrong he says I'm just trying to turn it around on him and victimize myself. He hardly apologizes while no matter how many times I apologize to him he acts like he forgives me but brings it up later about how horrible of a person I am. It takes two to argue and we're both in the wrong. He starts yelling at me and cussing but I just stop talking after that while he tells me how I do everything wrong. I just feel unhappy with my life. I'm struggling in college, my parents are distant with me, I have no friends, I just feel so alone. I wish I could leave somewhere and never come back. I'm not good enough for anything. "
So isolated from people that I don't know what to do anymore,I pretty much been a shut in since I graduated college. I still haven't found a job and scared to go on disability. My house has pretty much become a prison. 
My Dad is making me feel guilty because I'm mad at him,"I was at dinner with my parents last night, and we were discussing colleges and which school I thought was best for me. I said something like, ""This school is closest, but it doesn't offer the major I'm looking for.""  My Dad looked confused and asked, ""Now, just what major *are* you looking for?""
Um, what? I have discussed what I want to do after college countless times with my folks for years, and now he can't remember what it is? Without trying to sound too angry, I said, ""Psychology!"" (I don't want to major in psych but i'm saying that for the sake of the story). 
He pinched his eyebrows together and asked, ""Okay...psychology--------"" as if there were a second part to psychology, like psychology humanities or some shit. What the hell?
He always does shit like this, and it pisses me off. I'm not afraid to say I was fairly quiet the rest of dinner. I wasn't giving him the silent treatment like a five year old, but yeah, I was pissed.
Now when he sees me or talks to me it's like he has a dark cloud over his head. He only responds to anything with, ""yeah...,"" or ""Guess so...""
I want to rip him a new one. I've always had a problem with my anger, but he always victimizes himself.  "
I am in no way gaining any weight and I'm hating this,"Since I was a child I've always been really tall and slim and though the kinder type tells me it's always better this way than being fat it still bothers me A LOT.
My family and doctors said I am like that because of my habitude but that's so bullshit. Everyone is able to put some weight on when they want it, why cannot I do the same?

I can't say I was bullied in school, but there were times I was called something like ""skeleton"" and similar. (English is not my mother tongue)

Probably because that's why I often feel ashamed of my body and disgusted by it. Usually I am a cheerful pal, have friends, I go out fairly often and I'm working out which finally shows some minimal results but I am still not gaining weight.

I've been tested for many things, all of them negative but they say I probably have IBS, Irritable bowel syndrome. A stress-related issue which is almost impossible to get completely rid of.

As you can see I'm not in the perfect mood, I'm having moodswings changing from + to - in a matter of few days. 
Sometimes I feel great and see hope in the future, through God and love with someone but it tends to fade after a time.

I am currently thinking about switching to a very strict diet which usually puts the actual symptoms to rest regarding the IBS but it is not confirmed to help me with my desire.

I read a lot, I tried a lot. Nothing helped me so far.  I am 21, 193 cm and around 72kg.

I feel like if I do this and if it's not helping I am left with no hope in life to accept my body which is crucial for mental health in the long term.

Thank you for listening!

TL;DR: I am tall and slim and I haven't gained any weight in literally 3-4 years.

"The fact that I have been assigned more ""work"" than my other ""team members""","We have a spread sheet assigned to us with 268 addresses that need to be corrected in our system. My 3 team members were assigned to do between 60 and 64. I was assigned 78. I already hate my job and this mind numbing ""work""."
I just saw that video of the girls abusing the turtles,"This video made me really sad because I love animals, and to see that happen to a turtle, especially a rare one, made me feel pity for the animal. Those girls are the worst people ever, because they did it because ""They were bored"".

This makes me sick."
People don't seem to care about the plane that was shot down,"I'm at work and the 225 casualties are all I can think about. My heart is breaking for their friends and families and it just seems so unfair. Meanwhile, everyone at work hasn't given it a second thought and is just carrying on as if the tragedy hasn't happened. Even when I try talking to my SO, friends and family about how upset I'm feeling, they seem to think I'm crazy for crying and feeling so sad about these lives that have been lost."
To the person who outed me as transgender,"I know that you have told other people without my permission. 3 people have now told me that 'everyone knows'. These 3 have all been supportive of me and have found your actions totally disrespectful, unwarranted and disgusting. They all thought they you were just another annoying, catty teenager, but they realise that you had done something seriously fucked up. That you have crossed an intuitive line in the sand and done something beyond normal teenage shittiness. Something really big. If there has been any negative reactions from people towards my gender identity, then they felt no need to tell me. I am thankful for that. I wouldn't wish to know them anyway.

I completely understand that we are not really friends (and never will be), but I desperately needed to tell someone new about my true self. My transition had ground to a halt at that point due to one of my parents making me feel like utter shit all the time - nasty, emotionally manipulative stuff. My life seems like it was shutting down. it actually got so bad that I had to leave home for about a month to get away for it all. I would contact my parents twice a day to show them that I had not done anything 'drastic'. I told you because you were of little to no importance to me and if you did decide to tell others, you were unlikely to be believed. You have a reputation for being a compulsive liar. You were the first of many baby steps at that time towards self acceptance. You are currently 6 of 7 people I have personally told.

I shouldn't have to tell that trans men and women are very vulnerable people, but I apparently do. 41% of transgendered people will attempted suicide in their lifetimes. I am part of that statistic. By fucking with trans folk's deepest, darkest fears, by telling others they do not trust enough to tell earlier or do not want to tell at all, you are very likely to push them towards being part of this statistic. You are so fucking lucky that I have managed to accept my identity over the last 3 months - if this happened before then, I can guarantee you that I would be dead by now. Both our lives would be over. Still, doesn't mean I haven't been affected by what you have done. I have been regularly have panic attacks, 2 or 3 an hour, since finding out. They are fading away now, which I why I can now write this. I feel so violated. People I've never spoken to before know before most of my immediate family, including my brother. Also, it's not as if harassment or attacks are to be feared of because of this. These kind of things just happen - another reason for me to be fearful. They are disturbingly regular occasions for a lot of trans people.

You are one of two things. You are either a sad and pathetic child, who would rather throw someone under the bus just to desperately get the attention of people who you won't even speak to in a year or so. Or, you could be a sociopath, incapable of empathising with someone so vulnerable, so afraid - to disregard all that and to turn me into gossip for strangers is simply monstrous and evil. Whatever you are, you are a damaged human being. And even though my life is often hard and sometimes painful, I'm so glad I am not you. I feel so sorry for you!

I hope you can change and grow up. To responsibility for your actions. It's up to you really. Even if you realise how immensely hard you have fucked up and want to apologise, I will not accept it. Two words aren't gonna make this any different or any better. You are repulsive! This is something you will have to live with. Good luck with that. Have a nice life and fuck you!


I'm planning to send to the person who outed me soon. Also sorry for any typos."
I can't help my girlfriend and I feel like she doesn't appreciate me trying,"It seems like almost every day now that she texts me saying that she feels fat, how she hates herself, how she's a failure and that she doesn't deserve to be happy. I give her advice, I compliment her, I point out her strengths and explain how she's not failure. She's not fat... 

When she's with me she's usually really happy, but every now and then out of nowhere she'll get really upset where she's short with me and won't let me touch her. I usually try to leave her be when she's like that, but it's so hard to see that look on her face knowing she's beating herself up and if I do try to help she just sounds annoyed with me. 

It's literally almost everyday now of her texting me about how she hates herself. I try to help her, but she never tells me that she appreciates me trying or that I even help a little. 

I don't know, maybe I'm just not very comforting."
The girl I'm into and my gay best friend have a more sexual relationship that I've had with anyone in years.,"So I had some friends over this weekend. My gay best friend (we'll call him Steve) was there, with his boyfriend (his name will be Joe) , the girl I'm into (her name can be Anna) and a whole bunch of other people. I've known Anna for a decade and Steve for nearly 2.

I love that all of my friends seem to hit it off when I introduce them, and none so much as Steve and Anna. They're friendship gets a bit silly once alcohol is involved, though. They fake flirt with each other (she knows he's gay, and he is definitely not interested in women) and this escalated quite a lot in the past few weeks.

Steve knows that I'm into Anna, and that I've just not thought of the best way to tell her. I don't want to impose something on the friendship if there's nothing there, and she told me a few weeks ago ""I don't want to bother with relationships at the minute. Maybe in a year or so, though.""

I'm normally a pretty chill guy, if I do say so about folks not being into me (I've had more rejections than I care to remember). But I've no idea why this situation has affected me so much:

So we're all sat drinking, laughing and having a good time. When Steve walks past Anna and grabs both her boobs. She let's out a little surprise yelp, followed by some appreciative noises. He laughs, let's go and walks away. He's gay, so she thinks nothing of it, and he did it for the laugh. Joe didn't seem to care for the same reason. Steve made a point of walking over to me afterward and saying, quite loudly, ""jealous?"". Then he laughed and walked away.

I've been obsessing over this for days, and I can't seem to get over it. Is it entirely possible that I'm jealous of Steve? Probably. 

I'm being pretty pathetic about this, I'm sure. And I guess that I should just man up and tell Anna that I'm into her, but (given my track record) she'll probably make some remark about us being great friends and how that would change everything. I'm not into arguing the case for someone dating me (I'm not going to try and make someone do something that they don't want to do), so I'll probably not bother to try and convince her otherwise.

I wasn't like this when she was with her last boyfriend. I guess it's because Steve knows that I'm into her. Hell, she probably does too now - not just on Steve's post grope remark either; he's a bit of a chatterer when he drinks.

**edit**: a lot of you good folks are saying just to tell her, but no place any pressure on her. I'm interested in doing this, I really am. Were it not for the fact that I'm moving 60 miles away in a few weeks.

**edit 2**: because I'd forgotten to mention it before: I share a house with my gay friend, and I've been off with him since the ""event"". Now that I've had a few days to think on it (and some excellent advice form the folks here), I feel childish and stupid for reacting the way that I have.

**edit 3**: I told her. She said, ""I don't see you as the other half type."" at least I know.

**Edit 4**: I'm having out with Anna and Steve again (I know, I know. I'm making things worse for myself). ""I'd love to come home from work and fuck him every night,"" is what she just said about Steve. Lovely. Anyway, time to put this story to bed."
Bed bugs are ruining my life,"I had roomates who were disgusting not because they got bed bugs, but because they were incapable of following the instructions to get rid of them. I have now been dealing with bed bugs for several months and finally ended up moving out and thought that maybe, just maybe my life would get better.

Well it turns out my boyfriend now has them at his parents house, so I obviously offered to cover the pest control because it is on me that he got them and I feel SO TERRIBLE.  I am just so afraid, what stops them from coming back here? Are they really this impossible to beat? I just feel like I will never be able to get rid of them and I don't know what to do.

I can barely sleep, I have classes starting soon and with working 2 jobs and school I just don't know how to handle all this stress. I feel like I will never be able to find a way out of it, just feel miserable and disgusting and worst of all defeated. From what I read even after months of treatments some people don't get rid of them, or they resurge. Worst of all it's not happening to me, but to people I love and now I am afraid it is spread into my new apartment and maybe even my parents house and it just seems like there will be no end. 

TLDR: Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck FUCK bed bugs. "
Grandma,"She went to the doctor last Friday. They found nodules in her lung and sent her to the hospital. 

She's diagnosed with stage four lung cancer on Saturday. They do a biopsy on her lung and a petscan the next day. The nodules are the size of golf balls and are basically everywhere in her lungs. There was talk about chemo and how they'll do and MRI on Monday to see if it spread to her brain.

She's exhausted and embarrassed because she couldn't breathe well enough in the MRI machine.  They don't mind, you can do it in the morning when you feel better. I tuck her into bed. It'll be okay, Grandma. 

Tuesday, they find two tiny spots in her brain. The doctors don't seem too worried. They decide to only go ahead with chemo instead of both radiation and chemo. We're told she can come home Wednesday.

She calls us from the hospital saying that they haven't told her when she can leave yet. Actually, hang on, the nurse has some news, call you back. We get her oxygen and room set up.  She calls back. She'll tell us what the nurse says when she's home. 

She comes home and our dogs are so happy to see her. She says they're smiling at her. We get her settled She's happy just to be home and to be in her own room. So what was the news, Grandma? 

They did another x-ray, just to compare with the initial one. The tumors are much larger. It's growing rapidly. 

She has weeks instead of months to live. 

She's telling me what clothes and gadgets I can have. 

I tell her I'm moving up my wedding so she can be there. 

She's tells us she's ready to go. 

But I'm not ready to let her go."
I'm completely stress free when I shouldn't and I don't know why,"The end of the semester is coming up, and my grades aren't exactly good. I got a 3.26 GPA last semester, which was just enough to keep my scholarship money (you need >3.25 cum. GPA to keep it), and my grades this semester are going to drop it down below the threshold, which will make it even harder to pay for school, but for some reason I just don't care. No matter how hard I think I should be studying, I just don't. I say ""I'm going to study in the next hour"" or ""I'm going to do my homework."" and then I don't. I even make time to do my school work, to study, and anything else that I need to do, but I just don't do it. It's not that I'm daunted by the work, because it's relatively simple, and studying the material isn't that hard. I know that studying helps, because I've seen the improvements I've made when I do study vs. when I don't, but for some reason that still isn't enough to get me to study. My parents are the ones paying for my school right now, as I don't have a job or any money for myself, and I have no way of paying for my schooling outside of working for scholarships, and I know my parents are going to be both mad and disappointed, and I feel like an asshole for making them pay now $4000 extra per year on top of everything else they're paying for at home like my siblings' extracurriculars, and they can't just stop paying for those, because my brother's future is riding almost entirely on his sports team, which requires a lot of money a month. I just feel like I'm sucking away my parents' hard earned income by being a lazy fuck at school, and that still isn't enough to get me to stop going out drinking or smoking when I should be studying. I know what I'm doing is wrong, and I'm not getting some sick pleasure out of doing it, and I don't know why I can't just sit down and do my work.

Sorry for the giant wall of text, I just don't know what to do anymore.

Update: I just talked to my parents last night. I found out that my mom just got diagnosed with ADD, and I may have it as well. Next time I'm at home, I'm going to the doctor to get diagnosed. If I do have ADD, it would explain quite a bit about my study habits. Thank you all for listening."
Just a bunch of unwanted feelings and the need to vent.,"So I don't want to bother anyone, but I just need to at least let this out, and I can't think of anywhere else to go. So here it goes. I am a horrible person. About a year ago, my best friend broke up with her boyfriend, who of course also happens to be my friend. He took it really badly, so you know I was there for him. So we started talking more and more and of course grew much closer. And that's where the shit begins. He always was kinda my type of guy, but you know, my friend made a move so I backed up. Not that anyone ever knew. But now I think I'm falling for him. And that's really really bad. Even if I know my friend would be completely okay with it I couldn't even bring myself to make a move on him. And now some of our mutual friends are starting to say stuff along the lines of ""Oh you would make such a cute couple with Dude. I still on't understand why he went for her and not you."" Cause you know, it's obviously what I want to hear. And to make everything worst, even if the fact that he's my best friend's ex didn't bother me I couldn't even make a move on him anyways. Cause of course, I fall in the asexual spectrum of things, but the part where I absolutely love kissing and cuddling, but not anything more. So I can't even think about being in a relationship with someone even if I want to. And it's just so annoying, because not one of my friend knows, and all of my friends know the two ex lovebirds so I can't talk about it to anyone without being judged."
"My roommates tried to pull a shitty prank on me, I don't know how to deal with them now.","I left for a weekend long trip. I have two roommates, Ashley and Rachel, for our purposes. When I came back, Ashley told me that she went into my room over the weekend to use my flashlight when the power went out. Fine, whatever. When we were all talking together and recounting stories from the past weeekend, Ashley said that she had masturbated in Rachel's bed, who starts laughing hysterically. I assume there's more to the story, but instead of explaining they asked me if I would rather have someone masturbate in my bed or have sex in it. It's getting a little uncomfortable at this point for me, I play it off as jokingly as I can. Eventually Rachel says that she slept with her FWB in my bed, because it's the biggest one in our apartment, still laughing and defending that they put a blanket down. I get serious and told her that it was a serious invasion of my privacy, that it was my room and I expected them to stay out of it while I was gone. Both of them admit that it was a joke, that it didn't happen, that it was awkward now because they didn't expect me to react like I did. I didn't have much of an answer, washed my dishes and went into my own room. Rachel messaged me online to apologize and say again that it was a joke and it didn't happen.

There's a lot of things about the bad prank bothering me. I don't know if it actually happened or not because of the seriousness and the length to which they took the joke, and also because I feel ganged up on. I now feel paranoid about whether or not they were in my room, and if they are in here while I'm not. There's no way for me to lock my door without literally putting a lock on the outside. I don't want to start drama, but I'm not sure if I trust them to respect my room while I'm not home, even if it was a joke. I feel like they have broken my trust, which is upsetting because they are/were close friends. Regardless, I feel upset enough that I want an apology in person, even though I know neither of them are likely to do so and will most likely ignore the situation and play it off. I feel like if I bring it up again and say that I took it very seriously, they will accuse me of overreacting or not being able to take a joke, which would make the rest of the 2 1/2 months we're living together really awkward, but I'm upset enough that can't just let this one go.

Am I overreacting or were they really being huge dicks?"
Just received a rejection letter by my dream school,"Let me start by saying that it's MIT. Now you can tell me how the chances were already pretty low from the get-go, but still. I have been dreaming of going to MIT since I was a kid. I worked my ass off for the entirety of High School and now I'm lost. I honestly thought I had a chance of getting in, or at least wait-listed. But I got completely rejected. If you check my comment history you will see my thoughts in the MIT subreddit, and a discussion on getting rejected.

So yeah, dreams have been crushed today. That's what's bothering me.

**edit**: I am still waiting on decisions by Harvard and Stanford. Do you guys think emailing a professor of CS (my major) would help/hurt? All I want is to :

-express my interest in attending their universities and CS courses

-ask about research opportunities for undergraduate students.

-tell them I hope to be attending their university next fall"
I messed up big time,"We were 15 when we first met. We went to a trip where we were supposed to get to know our new classmates. To be honest, I was afraid of you at the beginning. I've always been very shy and your liveliness, openness and friendliness kind of scared me. But you were ok to talk to at the end of the trip. I was comfortable with talking to you.

We were casual friends the next two school years.

At the beginning of the third year my buddy and I came to class a little too late and our usual desk was occupied. By you. By just yourself. Being the asshole I am, I ditched my buddy and sat with you. I simply didn't want to sit right in front of the teacher. And that's the breaking point. It was just one class, but it influenced me and my life more than anything. We got to know each other much better and became close friends. We horsed around quite a lot during classes, but our teacher was a cool dude and didn't mind. We talked more and more...and then it happened. I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once. I loved looking straight into your eyes, watch you look away with a beautiful smile. I had no idea it was love at that time. But our teacher did and asked a couple of our classmates after class: ""What are the things like with those two?"" He said it loud enough for us to hear, I suppose non-deliberately. We got a little red and both of us looked away. 

Things went great the next three months and then the New Year's eve 2013 happened. I was pretty drunk and texted you the usual crap people send on this occasion. We got carried away (you said you loved me, too - I mean YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH ME? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME BEFORE?!) and I'm putting on my shoes and jacket, going for a dance with you. What a stupid thing to do. You were over 30 kilometres away and I had to walk all the way. In addition, I had to walk on a side of a road where cars go very fast. My friend tried to stop me, but try to talk some sense into someone in my position. So he let me go. Of course I managed like 2 kilometres and then lie by the side of the road for some time. Eventually, I turned around, apologized and started walking in the opposite direction, feeling defeated. I got back, sat on stairs inside and more or less spent my night with my head between my legs. 

One would think things would go the right way after this revelation, right? Wrong! Never with me. I thought it wasn't love, because I felt the real affection for you only when I was drunk. Next couple of months went ok, we acted like it hadn't happen. Then spring break came. A week for thinking right? You contacted me, because it's always like this. I never do anything. We set a date. And it wrecked me. I cried more or less the whole week. There was a prom we both went to on Friday. I spent most of the time with you dancing, drinking and talking. I got drunk and broke down crying in front of a group of my classmates. You asked me if I wanted to go for a walk. Of course I went. And those were the best moments of my life. We held hands, talked, and then we kissed. Slowly, passionately, carefully. Even though I was pretty hammered, I remember this clearly. Then we somehow split up and I haven't seen you for the rest of the night. 

One would think things would go the right way after this, right? Wrong! Never with me. Again, I blamed it on the alcohol and we acted like nothing had happened. Then, I brainwashed myself. I convinced myself that I don't really love you, I even thought I hated you for a couple of weeks. Then depression came. I started drinking and I cried every single time I had a few drinks. I also texted you how much I love you every time and apologized when I sobered up. I was getting worse and worse until November 2013. You gave me your last chance. I told you you wouldn't want a wreck like me. You insisted that you don't mind. But I knew my condition was awful. In the heat of discussion I told you I don't deserve you and that you should find someone better. My mental health kept descending for another month when it struck me. I was making a decision for you. It wasn't right. And I wanted to fix things up. I got a little better. I was doing it for you. You deserved a better person, so I was trying to be one. 

One would think things would go the right way after this, right? Wrong! Never with me. Let's fast forward to January 2014. I'm finally at lest a little comfortable in my skin so I decided to ask you out. It's Friday afternoon and I'm walking with my friend to school to tell you. And then, on the way, I meet you. With another guy. Holding hands. I thought it didn't happen until I got to school. A few friends wanted to go for a beer with me (I didn't tell them what happened), but I said I had stomach ache and went home. I was dying inside. I closed my blinds, turned on music and cried and shouted at myself. I hit the complete bottom (at least so far). I was suicidal. I missed my chance by a couple of weeks. How stupid life is? 

It's March now and I still have you in my head. I'm depressed as fuck. I'm not doing my hobbies any more. I don't study. My finals are coming and I'm thinking of dropping out of my school. Also suicide is in question again. I'm a wreck. I used to be among the best in my class, now I'm nothing. I was curious. Focused on my future, my goals. It's all gone. 

And you've moved on. Exactly as I told you. You don't give me the smile any more. I know I've put a lot of my shit on you during the years. I know I hurt you so much I'll never be able to repair it. And a bit of me dies again and again every time you mention our past. I'm happy only when I talk to you. Or see you. I don't even know what to talk about with you. You gave me thousands of chances and I rejected every single one of them. And then I finally see the light, happy, but it's not the sun. It's not the source of heat, love and life. It's just a reflection. A cold, deadly moon.

Is this what life's like? You start doing something right and you get kicked in the nuts for it? If yes, I don't want to live any more. "
"I don't confront my problems, I feel like crap all the time and I lost my mother a week ago... (Long post)","Hello. I am a 21 year old male who's in a weird situation at the moment. I spend a lot of time in front of the computer, I drink too much coffee and I don't get enough sleep. I also spend too much time by myself. I think I'm addicted to the internet and isolation.  

I've been doing this since I was fourteen, but I had a big breakthrough two years ago. I decided to become a better person and I did something about it. I started to work-out, eat healthier, take risks and be more social. The ""golden era"" ended last summer. I don't know how, but I gave up all of a sudden and went back to my old habits. 

I know that I'm being an irresponsible, lazy brat who's not doing anything productive, and I know that I should do something about it, but it feels like my motivation and sense of responsibility have disappeared. It's as if my common sense and my decision-making hate each other. It doesn't help to know that I should get out of my comfort zone and take small steps toward progress every day. I've tried that and it usually ends with that I give up after two or three days.

I also lost my mother a week ago (which sucks a lot by the way!!!). She had been struggling with cancer for nine years, and she got really sick in November. The doctors told us that she only had two months left in December. Me and my family spent as much time as we could with her. I feel that I didn't do enough to show how much I appreciated her, even though I helped her a lot, talked with her and was told that I did a good job. I was tired most of the time (due to my habits) and I didn't get to say all the things I wanted to say because of that. 

My shitty computer-coffee-staying-up-late-addiction/habit ruined my last months with my mother, and it sucks to know that I did that towards her. I *think* she appreciated the help she got from me and my family, and my emotional state *might* affect my perception of reality, but still: How could I be that selfish and useless?! 

My mind has been a beehive for the past couple of months, and I'm worried that I'm about to get a mental disorder or something. I've been to a therapist several times, but she thinks I'm fine. Baaaaaaah... Sorry about the long rant. 

Anyways; I would appreciate any advice on how to become less lazy, self-absorbed and self-destructive, and how to cope with the death of a loved one. 



"
Not sure who's being petty here,"I live with two other roommates, both of which I consider my closest friends. One I've lived with since last September, the other moved in last month. We were friends before, they didn't get along great with their other roommates, and we had an empty room. So, them and their dog moved in. It's been a little rocky, because they don't mesh as well with my other roommate's and my living style, but we can work past it.

What's bothering me is: newest roommate and I were looking for a class to take together, which is a long and tedious process (we're studying abroad, to make matters more difficult). I was a little annoyed that they obviously don't care about this class as much as I do, and while we were looking over the schedule, apparently they thought that I was double checking them often. I came home to grab something really quickly when they thought I would be out, and left again. I got a text from them saying that if I overheard them bitching about me being condescending and thinking that they're incompetent to my other roommate, they were sorry and should have brought it up to me. I didn't hear them, so it was unpleasant to find out that they'd been talking about me while I wasn't there, and even more annoying when I apologized for making them feel that way, and that it wasn't my intent. They responded that they knew it wasn't my intent, but it still happened and I hurt their feelings.

I feel like it was a little petty for them to bring it up to me in the first place. They know my intents aren't malicious, and double checking everyone is just a habit/character trait of mine, because I don't trust that I'm not getting wrong information, especially in this particular situation where I give a lot more shits than they do. I was exasperated, because what am I supposed to do about it? Sorry I hurt your feelings, I guess you just don't like my personality in that case? I feel like they're starting drama where there doesn't need to be. "
"Right now, I feel as though I can't go on. Life is getting to me, in a big way.","Right now, I feel as though I can't go on. I know the feeling will probably pass because it always does but right now, at this moment, I really do feel like shit. (By the way, I am not suicidal. I just want to lie down and wait for everything to go away) I am so depressed, I haven't even eaten today and that is a big thing for me, because I like food! But I just don't feel like it. I have a headache and my eyes are puffy from crying too much. I have no one to talk to and my girlfriend doesn't understand. In fact, she is making it worse although I don't think she realises. Since going back to Uni after Christmas, I have been feeling down. So much so that all I want to do is lie in bed all day and stare at the walls. I've been ill since the start of Christmas and it hasn't gotten much better so that is probably the main reason for this. Also, I will admit, I am a worrier so anything that happens (or doesn't happen) I always think of the worst. And when I get depressed, I go downhill  because I start thinking of my past, which wasn't pleasant. Although nothing ever happened directly to me, I have been surrounded by illness and death almost all my life, since I was 6 with my Grandad dying. And then my Dad, when I was 8, had a major stroke and almost died. He is still in hospital and although is better than what he used to be, and I feel selfish for saying it, but I want my Dad back, before any of it happened. Moving on, when I was 9, my Mum was diagnosed with lung cancer and a few months before my twelfth birthday, she passed away. It wasn't until I was older (I amm 19 now) that I realised that it really did affect me in such a huge way. Once I love someone, I don't want to let them go and I worry so much about them, that they will just get up and leave or worse. I'm also stupidly afraid of death. Well, in particular, my death. Any illness causes me to believe that I am going to die. Any headache that I have makes me think I will have a stroke. Anyway, what I have written is rather long. I just wanted to get all this off my chest. I'm not really sure if I am asking for advice, just for some to listen so if you do read all of this, thank you very much for taking your time to do so."
The way people treat of me,"I'm so sick of people calling me an asshole. I have a tendency to meet people, befriend them and jump right into joking around with them and no one seems to get that I'm not really trying to be mean. I just want people to like me and trust me to know when to be serious.
 
Also people will occasionally act superior to me like they know better than me, but truth is I do in fact know better than you how to do my job you stupid motherfucker.

And now one of my best friends is keeping me out of the loop of some obviously important stuff going on in his life. It seems like he's trying to keep me from getting involved to save me, but still it bothers me that he's going to this stupid girl he hasn't known as long who he isn't dating, who is less emotionally secure and intelligent than I about it. I think the official reason is she's privy to it all anyway, but dammit I don't know if he would have told me anyway.

Eventually all the nice and compassion in my heart is gonna dry up and I'm really going to be an asshole with a charred blackened heart.

Also, with nearly all my friends going to see a therapist, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say I'm the most emotionally well adjusted of the bunch of us. I don't see why people don't just man up and deal with it and move on."
"Girl I'm talking to was in an engagement of 2 years with a guy she dated for 4 years. He left her ~8 months ago, this is how I'm being treated...","So for the sake of the story we will call her Alice. 

Alice and I have known each other for 9 years. We re connected shortly after she was left (I hadn't talked to her much before then, I saw she had been left, I tried to help her through her emotional troubles). 

This was 6 months ago. She had been single for 2 months. We hung out, talked, she shared her stories and I tried my best to help her get through it. We began hanging out so much that 3 months into our reconnection, I had begun to form feelings. I decided to brush them off as they seemed selfish and childish given her circumstance. Well maybe a week or two after I began feeling that way, she told me she did also which made me feel great. 

Fast forward 3 months and here we are. We are best of friends with a weird relationship-like friendship. She says she wants to be my girlfriend at some point, but first needs to still take it slow. She SAYS take it slow so she can be sure I'm not ""another one of those guys"", but recently I found out she's still (reasonably) hung up on the failed engagement. I completely understand it. 

The thing is, she's treating what we have much like a real relationship. She's expecting me to be exclusive, not hang around anybody that ""has feelings for me"", etc. 

Is this fair? I should say something right? It's been 3 months now that we've been talking, kissing, cuddling, hugging, going out to dinner ... And yet she doesn't want a relationship. She can't give me an idea of when she will want to call it official. 

Sorry for the long speech, I know most of you won't read through it but for the ONE person who does, I'm just wondering if I'm wrong for thinking I should be allowed to live the single life while she is wanting to ""take it slow"" and get over this other man?"
Thanks r/whatsbotheringyou! (X-post from r/depression),"I just wanted to tell everyone here, thank you for existing. Every single one of you. 

Each OP reminds me that I'm not alone even when I'm not feeling great, and that some people have it worse, so I should be thankful for what I do have, even if it's hard to see some days.

Each commenter reminds me that there are great people out there across this great big world that are willing to take time in their day to go through the new posts in this subreddit and remind people that they matter. To those who PM people, or Skype, or even if it's just a few words of encouragement: It truly makes a difference to those of us who feel so utterly alone to be proven wrong even if it is just for a moment. 

Sometimes I want to delete my r/depression and r/whatsbotheringyou posts because this is my main profile and I don't want everyone to realize how alone and sad I am. Today though, I read through the old comments and they were so touching they made me cry. I'll be keeping them for future reference, when I need them. And I know I'll need them. 

I'm nowhere near being relieved of my loneliness and depression permanently, but at least some things help distract me. This subreddit gives me hope, though, that maybe I'll find myself and make myself whole. And hopefully I'll find wonderful people like you to have near me and be my support so I'm not so lonely anymore.

 I'm trying my best to look up. I hope you are too, whatever situation you might find yourself in. It gets better, I'm told. We won't know until we get there, ne?

TL;DR: Thank you. You matter to me, and you've made my life a little bit brighter."
"(not a big deal but) my parent's pay for most of my sister's living expenses, and maybe 7.5% of mine (until today). We're both college students living on our own, more info inside.","Me and my sister are 5 years apart (I'm her older brother), and we will graduate with our degrees at the same time, and we both have a pre-paid college tuition (courtesy of our military widow grandmother.) I have two part time jobs to pay my bills, and my sister works sometimes at catering's for a restaurant she used to work at, and also as a nanny/house sitter/ dog sitter for one family.
I moved out when i was 18, and i'm almost 25 now. When i moved out i was in college, and i got an apartment, and i've been paying my bills since then on my own, with the exception of my phone bill ($15 paid for by my mother, i have a brick phone), and until today, my auto insurance. ($45 a month paid for by my father. I have a small efficient truck and the cheapest possible insurance plan.) I was in and out of college since i was eighteen, but I'm back for my third straight semester of A's as a part time engineering student (2 courses per semester.)

I work part time and I am a part time student. I work 20 hours a week for UPS loading trucks in the early AM, and i work 10 hours a week friday and saturday nights at a nightclub as a bouncer. I also work odd jobs when i have time (working on my friend's motorcycles, small handyman jobs, mowing lawns, etc.) I take no money from the government besides my tax return (principals). With these jobs i make about $800 a month and i can afford my $225 rent (i rent a 4 bedroom house with 3 other guys), and my $100 in other monthly expenses (gym, internet, utilities.) However, i still come up short at the grocery store and the gas station.
What I'm trying to convey here is that i work hard jobs at rough hours and i don't make much, but i live cheaply and simply, and i'm usually broke.

Today i met with my dad to get some old clothes from him, and he asked me if i could start paying for my own insurance, since i'm about to turn 25 and my rate will go down. he said he needed to start giving my sister more money. i told him of course that wouldn't be a problem. He is an out of work contractor with a fair bit of physical problems and his sole income is disability pay from the government.

Him and my mom (divorced) pay for my sister's rent, which is an all inclusive student apartment near the university. It's $550 a month. Before that she lived in the dorm, which cost about the same.
Lately she was complaining to my mom's side of the family that my dad isn't paying her the full amount he said he would to pay her rent.
My dad is pretty broke, and pays what money he has to keep our 40 acre farm we grew up on, (he knows i want to buy it from him once i start making money.)
It bothers me that my sister expects money from my parents for bills she is capable of paying. She says she is being forced to dip into her savings to pay her bills (she has at least 6 grand saved up that i know of). I have 60 dollars in my account right now, and $700 of credit card debt. She makes a fair bit of money with her spare jobs, and she buys fairly frivolous purchases. ( New furniture, custom wall hangings, $100-$200 jewelry items, shoes, etc. She pays for it with money from her savings.) Plus me and my father make her things and do all her home/vehicle maintenance for her. (Usually me since i live 3 miles from her and my father lives 25 miles away.)

I don't say anything to her about it, and i never invite comparison between us in front of our parents. I feel like it's fair for me to pay all of my own bills, after all i'm a part time student and she's a full time student, i'm in community college (cheaper) and she's in University (which i'll be attending as well in 2015). The only thing is i couldn't stop working to become a full time student, my parents can't afford to support both of us.

This is probably just more of a rant, i can repost somewhere else if this isn't the appropriate venue. I don't feel like there is a solution. It could be worse, my sister could be on drugs, she could be failing school, she could have a terrible boyfriend, etc. But she is a well-adjusted person that may just be a bit spoiled. 
I also feel like as the son i should be self-sufficient and as the daughter she should be taken care of.
So i don't mind doing my part to help my dad, but i wish she would stop taking his help for granted.

TL:DR. my sister has all her living expenses paid for by our parents and lives above the family's means, i get 2% of my expenses paid for by them and live very cheaply. We are both students. I work 30 hours a week and she works 5-6 hours a week. My father just stopped paying my auto insurance so he could pay her rent.

I thought our relationship was good for both of us, but it's actually not.","I kept thinking there was some reason that this made me so sad, but I've finally admitted the obvious, I can't stand the thought of losing her, even though I HAVE TO let her go to help her."
I miss home.,"I just flew over 900 miles to visit my mom for 2 weeks. I skipped the last week of school just to have some extra time with her, but now that I'm here I just want to go home. I miss home and it's becoming unbearable. I've never missed home this much in my life, and Im gone for months at a time sometimes. I've been here for 3 days. don't know how or if I should tell my mom. I haven't seen her in months and she's so stoked that I'm here, she would be heartbroken. But I don't want to spend the next 10 days in sadness. Usually I don't let it effect my attitude but it's beginning to cripple me. I just came home to cry. I don't know what to do."
Cannot tell weather I am lazy or just really depressed,"So I am a newly minted grad student I moved to a new city this semester (I dont know anyone here) I live alone (NOT BY CHOICE) and I have been battling some serious depression the entire semester (mostly because I'm alone and its hard for me to handle). After the first round of midterms I got C's (around average for the classes) figured I just needed to study harder etc. After the first found of midterms (about a month into the semester (2 midterms and a final kind of schedule)) I started getting really depressed over the loneliness, and everything just lost meaning. It would ebb and flow but some days I just couldnt do anything, nothing mattered, currently, nothing matters, seccond round of midterms comes around, I burn an entire weekend studying for one of them, and get worse than the first. On top of that I get it back and fix all of my mistakes in about an hour using nothing but the formula sheet we were given for the exam, after that...well things got worse, now there are days I'm just skipping class and doing NOTHING for hours followed by internet followed by feeling like shit for doing nothing, but then reminding me that it doesnt matter because even if I do something it wont help.

"Even making art, I feel empty.","Fairly certain I've just been in a depressive slump for some weeks now. When I can be bothered to feel anything, about all I can manage is anger or anxiety, but it's mostly this generally unpleasant sense of self loathing.

""So why not pursue one of your creative outlets? Draw some stuff? Knit? Do a cross-stitch? Get some of those bad feelings out in a productive way?"" My friends have said, in an attempt to help me with something that I'm perfectly aware they can't really help me with. 

I find it difficult to care enough to bother, but even when I make myself finish something, I don't feel any sense of accomplishment. I am just as disgusted with myself as I was before (despite arguably being more productive than I normally am in the evenings, which intellectually seems like it really *ought* to count for something) and now there's some new dumb piece of shit PSD file on my hard drive or my ugly wool rectangle is a few rows longer. 

I'm even *fairly* technically competent at drawing, but everything I create just seems so void of anything worthwhile. Inexplicable anger, sadness, and/or apathy seem like the kinds of subjects that could make for interesting art pieces, but I just *don't fucking care*.

I remember when this used to be so enthralling that I'd spend 7 hours drawing or making pictures with thread, until I'd realize it was 2 in the morning and I needed to go to sleep. Now everything seems like a tedious waste of time, though I struggle to think of anything I'd rather be doing.

Nothing else seems even vaguely engaging, either, which is kind of frustrating. Not my friends, my karate class, my supposedly favorite shows that my friends all keep up with (and who will wonder why I'm not caught up), or my little warm dog. Fuck, this shit is making me *boring*."
I don't think I'm capable of loving another person.,"Well, the title pretty much says it all.

Now, I have my family, friends, and acquaintances, but I honestly don't think ""love"" applies to any of them. Think about how hard it is to say ""I don't love my parents"" (not to them of course) when they didn't do anything to deserve that. I alternate feeling like a monster and a broken person.

And even though my previous plans included marriage as a prospect, that seems impossible now. I couldn't care for anyone the way I perceive married couples should. My previous romantic encounters have supported that opinion pretty well, too.

So there you have it. I might was well be a sociopath."
Maths,It's really frustrating. I can't seem to get the current topic we're doing (derivatives of trigonometric functions) and I feel really demoralised and just crap... just finished my homework and I literally got 8/10 questions wrong. 
I got stood up and I feel pretty crappy.,"Let met preface this by saying I realize this is a minor issue (that will certainly pass) compared to what other people deal with, but I still feel really crappy.  

So this has never happened to me before and it feels strange. I had made plans with a girl to grab drinks last night. She wanted to bring her roommate (she seemed pretty shy so this seemed normal, and I'd bring my roommate too). Anyway, on Friday, we set up a place and a time, etc. Saturday night, she texted me a handful of times to let me know she was on her way and to see if I was there yet. Obviously she doesn't come to the bar. I guess I just don't get why (1) she would give me her number, (2) set up a time and place and tell me she was coming, and (3) if she's not interested, why not just tell me? It doesn't seem like it should be so difficult. I'm super embarrassed. I sat there with my roommate while currently getting stood up. I feel really stupid, and I'm not one who feels stupid very often.

"Got Romance Scammed Again, sort of","Well years ago, I was in contact with this russian lady, cute, sent me photos, and we had this long distance thing going on. 

Short story, she wanted me to help pay for her to come to America. Boy was I dumb, and naive. After talking to my parent's I realized how naive I was. 

And this was over 10+ years ago.

I'm 51, about 2-3 week's ago, stupid me, placed an advert in the craigslist, and got a response. With this lady named Shannon. 

Said she lived in my state, and but had family in Phillipines, etc.

I had indicated that I wanted to meet her, before deciding how well we got along. Almost immediately she ignored that, and kept giving me lovey dovey talk.

Then I got an email about 5 hours ago, saying she had medical problems in the Phillipines, and wanted me to send her 300 bucks.

I just sent a response, tolding whoever this was to ""Get Lost"".

I know I am a lonely man, but why do I let these idiots scam me and hurt me so much, lol.

Just very frustrating.

My life is moving forward, joined Toastmasters, going back to college in the Spring. Volunteering at the local community to help with English Second Language.

But outside of that I have no job, no friends, no one really show's any interest in hanging with me.

I am just tired of that I have to be always the one to show interest in others, why do other people refuse to show any interest in me?

Am I so horrible?"
Loneliness is getting the best of me.,"I've been single for almost a year now, and it was a horrible break up, for me anyways. Totally caught me off guard. But Especially lately, I've been super lonely. All of my friends don't seem to want to talk to me. I haven't had any sort of physical contact with a girl in a long time, and I think that's whats killing me most. I'm a very affectionate person. I love cuddling, and I feel like nothing would make me happier than to do that again."
She's not texting me back.,"So, I am getting to know this girl quite well, and we've been texting almost all the time. I really enjoy talking with her and receiving attention almost all the time. However, lately she hasn't been responding much at all. It makes me nervous, and frustrated because it makes me think I'm the only one who cares. She talks to me at school just the same, but it just bothers me that she's not texting me back. I hate feelings clingy, especially when she's not. Anyway, that's what's bothering me. Should I say anything about it? Thanks for listening. "
what a fucking mess that logically has a perfect solution,"But just bothers the fuck out of me still the same.

I am married. Over 1 year now been together for about 6. I love my wife. I have a little 1 month old girl who is beautiful.

I have fallen in love with this wonderful girl that i met playing online games. This all sounds fucking lame and boring but hey its bothering me.

It was just sexy chat at first, flirting and fun, then it started to become a bit more serious and before i knew it i was falling for her and her for me.  We knew nothing could happen, and that i wouldnt leave my family.

Fast forward a bit, and she meets another guy and starts to form a relationship with him. At this time i realise im in trouble. This girl is inside my brain, every second i think about her. She tells me last night that her and this guy are official. Thats when i said ""i would have left my wife for you"" 
She said you should have told me before. She felt.. (past tense) that way but had to move on. At this point 12 hours later the reality of the situation hits me, i am so desperately attracted to this beautiful young woman but in my heart i couldnt leave my family, and i really do love my wife. (sex life is a bit zero atm, after just having a baby, and im on SSRI's which kill my sex drive anyway)

So right now, the situation is that i said i still want to be friends, and still want her in my life, and she feels that same way. We chat each night and are a part of a small group of people who actively voice chat.

The sting of rejection is strong, and im at the 2-3rd stage of rejection, working through it with chicken soup and sloe gin.

The situation has resolved itself perfectly. In fact its strengthened my love to my family and my choice to be a husband and father.

yet im still hurting? 

Was it all just infatuation? Do i still keep her in my life? Am i a fucking terrible example of a human being? [yes]
She messages me ""i hope you are okay"" and asked me back into the voice chat tonight. I dont think i can do that, and i dont think its a wise decision.
I am thinking that perhaps i should cut her out of my life. 
The worst thing is though is that she is terribly lonely, family life non existant, shit job, her social life is us guys on voice chat, and me. She has breast cancer as well, and she has mentioned multiple times that i am the only thing keeping her sane.

I dont know what to fucking do apart from some solutions in a bottle of wonderful plymouth sloe gin.

Right now i think i do need to just not talk to her for a bit. Get over whatever butthurt im experiencing.
The entire situation has shown me things i dont want to see in myself, and then facing confliction opinions and ideas for what to do.

She is an amazingly fun gentle loving girl who now has a boyfriend, who.. in 24 hours will be shipping off for basic training, and once again leaving her pretty well alone again and relying on my assurance and presense to help her with her illness.

Meanwhile i have a loving beautiful caring wife who up until now i thought i loved with all my heart, but now i think i didnt... but now having a wonderful new appreciation for her.


FUCK.

Everything is futile.,"Despite all the groups and organizations that want to see different things in the world whether they be the various religions, political stances, or environmental care, nothing will ever change. Things will just continue as they always have and nothing drastic will ever happen, either good or bad, things will just progress, but no one will ever wake up and just realize that things need to change and will magically fix everything, all we can hope for is to just shoulder through and make our own bit of ""paradise"", if you can call it that, for yourself."
"Middle of Life, and I am just not sure what to do","I am 51 years old, I have plans in the spring to go back to college, but I am not just sure if that's the right thing or wrong thing to do.

Currently, very sadly, I have been dependent on my parents to pay for my living, for the last 2 years, because I have struggled massively to get a job.

I have just been so burnt out from all my decades of working, and finding incompetent companies, incompetent managers, and corrupt corporate culture, that I just don't trust myself to find a place to work, that won't be just like my worst nightmares.

I don't mind working, but at age 51, I don't want to go back and work for crap fast food, telemarketing, or programming jobs. Where the pay sucks, management incompetent or chaotic, treated like a cog where I don't matter.

I want to go back to college to study Economics and Politics, because I feel that inside my head is a few ideas and solutions to solve our massive incompetent and ineffective federal government. I won't talk politics here, just that I want to be a part of solving our national problems, even if in a small fashion.

I have this complex of wanting to make a difference in my life, because at age 5, I was told I could never have kids. 

So how else will I be remembered, If I don't leave a mark in some fashion?

I am interested in learning economics and politics, but today I took a math assessment test, which went fine, I passed, but didn't do great.

But in the experience of that, what such utter disorganization, miscommunication and chaos, reminds me why I hated my days at other colleges I've been to.

I am very cynical, but I've had many experiences that feed that cynicism. 

I have no friends, outside of my youngest brother, but he's married and he's expecting his first child. So he's pretty busy with his life.

I just want my own life.

My girlfriend, died about 2 years ago, My Cat died 5 years ago, I broke my right leg 3-4 years ago. 

But I am tired of being a victim and feeling like a victim, I want to be sure that I am taking the right path.

I am so afraid of making the wrong move, that sometimes I make no move.

The kind of person I want to be, is the kind that see's patterns, and provides tools and methods to solve our problems. 

I have zero interest in trying to persuade or sell or give speeches. I just want to help solve real problems.

Last early summer I was volunteering locally, to help people study English Second Language, and US Citizenship Testing, and I truly enjoyed that. I like and love helping people, makes me feel worthy and good.

I like helping people, I do help alot of my friends online, and have started recently doing that alot on the reddit site here.

Just don't know how to do that and make enough money to go back to college.

Any thoughts or suggestions?"
"Got straight-up told that I could pick anxiety attacks, or Jesus.","I should preface this by saying I am 100% certain that this was done with love, and at no point was she anything but sweet and concerned, *but*. 

It really, profoundly bothers me when people insist that my anxiety problems are A. all in my head and essentially voluntary, B. fixable with Jesus, or C. *both!*

I'm living back at home due to debts (oh hi, sudden emergency medical bills) and I made the mistake of expressing the fact that I was having an anxiety attack. Or that it had escalated to a panic attack. Or that the past three or four weeks have, basically, been one long anxiety attack with brief breaks for puppy kisses and wine. My aunt cornered me in my room and gave me a long spiel about Jesus. And, I get it, she was trying to help in her own way. I love that my family loves me. 

But, ""You can choose Jesus, or you can choose the panic attacks."" ""You're the only one who can control the thoughts that are in your head."" ""When your mom gets back with the medicine, you can tell her, 'I don't need those, I have Jesus!'"" (I was having a panic attack, and my pills were elsewhere, but I couldn't drive to get them. I didn't even ask, my mom just went to get them because she is sweet.) In the end I played along with it to get her to leave. 

It just makes me feel *even worse* to suggest that my *diagnosed-by-doctors anxiety disorder, complete with panic attacks* is something that I'm allowing to happen, by way of just not trying hard enough or just not being Jesusy enough. I already feel like a wuss for the thought of driving to Dallas alone at night sending me into a knock-kneed, hyperventilating, dizzymaking panic attack and missing my friend's show. 

Now I'm being told I'm letting it happen for not following the same religion that also used to give me panic attacks because I was convinced every loud noise at night was the Apocalypse. I would express this, but I don't want to sadden my mother, and I'm almost certain I would be told that if Christianity caused me terrible anxiety, I was doing it wrong. 

I realize I'm essentially bitching about my well-meaning aunt trying to help me because I was panicking, but it left me even more distressed than when she started. :("
AP Computer Science is drowning me,"I am a high school senior this year and I'm trying to escape AP Computer Science. The class is rigorous, the teacher is not great, and I'm falling behind. I have no idea what's going on in this class and I'm very anxious that I will fail because I'm so behind. I'm taking a test today that was only announced two days ago and I think I will fail it. My classmates seem to have no problems with the material because they have backgrounds in programming. I only took a basic programming class last year and I did fine with it and I thought I'd really enjoy this class. I really don't, I hate it! Computer Science was even my intended major for college, but I'm not so sure what to do with my life. I'm falling behind because of my own goddamned laziness and the fact that I hate this class! I really want to switch to regular Computer Science so I can slow down, but none of my classes will let me switch and the one out of the two classes are completely full. If I try to switch to another class, I feel I would be too far behind since the other classes are already a month in. I don't know what to do about this because I'm so behind and I understand absolutely nothing about what we're learning! Fuck it, seriously fuck this! What should I do?! I feel so lost and alone."
I cannot seem to be proud of myself for more than five seconds.,"Recently quite smoking cigarettes about a month ago. Feels good, getting my air back. The gym is easier. These are good things. 

However, I still drink too much (daily, lots of beer) and went from smoking good weed to shitty weed because I am not currently working. I graduated college and started working temp jobs which was fine at first but now it's been over a year. Have had several long term assignments but they never wanted to hire me even though I work hard and am timely.

I have bad dreams about violence towards me and have little interest in others and am trying to get back into reading as a means of escape. I am young and seem to have lost interest in the opposite sex....other people in general I suppose. 

I can feel my world getter smaller and smaller and with all this time for sleeping I'm having nightmares about people being violent towards me, excessively tall buildings with little structural integrity, suffocation, rape, childhood home, and giant bodies of water.

I was given almost everything, I have no debt and no ""real"" concerns. I don't have to worry where my next meal is coming from so why do I feel this incredibly weight of failure even when, empirically, I'm doing pretty decently?

I am letting my writing go to shit out of sheer laziness. I feel like I am becoming less of a person every day. Just getting chipped away at by nothing.

God, that felt good."
Whats my age again?,"So I have been dating my boyfriend for 2.5 years, we have been talking about moving in together.  We both have pretty crazy work schedules and I live about 15-20 min away.  He will be going into residency and I have a full-time job at a hospital.  My mother is rather religious but not that ridiculous about relationships and such but I was still scared to talk with her and let her know of our plans (which are projecting for a year from now). 

I finally got the courage to talk to her today and she basically told me she would never support it unless we were married and that is the only way she would approve of it.  She told me my reason for wanting to move in with him is not valid (I actually want to see him on a day to day basis and I live at his apartment 95% of my life regardless). My apartment is a glorified storage unit. 

She also knows how much I respect her and value her opinion, she has saved me from making huge life mistakes when I was younger and I know she has a lot of experience and great things to teach me.  However, this is something I feel so strongly about for the first time I want more then caring about what she thinks.  I have every intention of marrying my boyfriend but not just as an excuse to live with him so my mom can sleep at night.  Everyone tells me just do it and she will get over it, but I have never been the one to just do things if I know I will be going against someone that has had a huge role in my life.

TL;DR: I am 24 with a full-time job, a good salary, great insurance, but am scared to go against my controlling mothers wishes of me not moving in with my boyfriend.  "
"I knew that the line of work that I love is tough, but sometimes it's tough in unexpected ways.","I went to law school to become a public defender. I wanted to fight for people who didn't have anyone to fight for them -- the folks who were last in line. Well, I wound up in a private firm, doing criminal defense work while waiting to take the bar exam. 

I love the field. I believe in it. I know it's definitely not for everyone, and that's good -- the world needs good police and prosecutors, too. It also needs good defense attorneys. At any rate, I always figured that the strain of the work would come from representing people you didn't like or knew to be guilty. Strangely enough, I like most of our clients (I guess I can usually find something to like in most people), and I've got no qualms with the guilty. We're all human, and I'm pretty sure we've all fallen short. 

But something's been eating me up lately, and I'm really not sure what to do about it or how to address it. We represented someone who was charged with rape some time ago. We investigated, and presented our side of the case, and the charges were dismissed, evidently because the grand jury didn't believe the complaining witness.

Then, shortly thereafter, she killed herself.

I can't seem to shake it...it's been on my mind a lot. I've lost a few friends recently to suicide, and so I've had to wrestle a lot with it. I know that people make their own choices in the end, and maybe there's really no way to ever know why someone does what they do.

But I can't help but feel responsible in some way, even if, intellectually, I know I'm not, that we didn't do anything dirty, etc. 

I just...I fucking hurt so bad for her and her family. The last two women I was in love with were both raped, one while I was in a relationship with her, and I was right there with both of them while they struggled with whether or not to go to the police, and with their emotions, their feelings of being devalued, how they felt alienated, how one of them was ostracized from her group of friends because the person who raped her was also a part of that group and was more popular than her. I remember during first year finals that I was studying at her house to just be there for her despite us being broken up for some time because she had no one else to talk to.

So...it brings all that shit back for me. I don't guess there's anything to be done. It's just an awful situation, and I feel like I'd get weird looks if I talked to my co-workers about what was bugging me. So thanks for letting me vent."
I want to switch career choices. But none of my superiors agree.,"So I was into music the past about 2 years in school and another 3 before that in guitar. (that I never really enjoyed) I play the alto sax, am good at playing it, reading the music, but am not really all that good theory. 

Other the summer I got a job working at a factory and my father holds a high level position there so I was able to have some time doing maintenance work even though it was not what I signed up for. I enjoyed it. A lot. And there are far more jobs for this than in Music.

I'm thinking of switching because I don't want to sink tens of thousands of dollars into university were I would most likely hate the courses, sitting there listen to a prof ramble on for hours on music theory etc, when I can go to college, learn a trade which I like doing, hopefully find a good job somewhere and live comfortably. 

I'm afraid to tell anyone I want to switch career choices because they all feel like I'm some amazing player who deserves to be living in vegas with a million dollars at all times in my bank account. *of course that was exaggerated* But you get the point. I kind of told my music teacher this and she got rather course with me, and I can't even begin to think of how to tell my parents. I am unsure of what to do here.

TL;DR Was into music, tried Mechanic/trade work, loved it, want to that instead because it has a more certain future than going to uni for music and trying my entire life to make a solid income. Don't know how to break the news to my superiors/supporters.

Trying to move on,"Sorry for the block of text, but I just feel the need to vent. 

I have known this one girl for less than three years through work and for a substantial portion of this time we were great friends.  I grew feelings for her early on, but did not press on anything due to our work relationship.  We spent a significant amount of time together inside and outside of work and I definitely felt like an emotional support for her.  She knew I was there for her and we enjoyed spending time together.  

I think she knew I liked her, but I just kept it moving forward as it was until I eventually brought up how I felt about her and she said she wasn't ready for a relationship at this time, but she should be dating someone like me.  However, even though she said these things to me she started having sex with another guy and she knew this hurt me and actually apologized, but continued to fool around with him anyways.  I should have moved on at this point looking back at it, but I continued to remain friends even though I still had feelings for her. 

We stayed pretty close and people regularly thought we were dating.  I felt as though our relationship was more than just friends, because it felt like and we would treat each other like we were a couple.  However, we never kissed or went any further than a hug.  She was always very open, comfortable, and giving me her attention when we were alone, but when we were out with a group she was regularly very cold towards me and almost ignoring my presence.  Even though this was the case, she would always end up reaching back out to me after whatever social event.

I eventually wanted to know where this was going, because I felt as though I was being put on the backburner or she was getting the benefits of a boyfriend without being in a relationship with me.  I had a talk with her and all she apologized and said she felt terrible, but wanted me to move on.

I still see her, but I don’t know how to act at this point.  This really has me torn up inside and I’m sure she can sense that, because I have not been spending much time with her over the past few months and have kept the communication to a minimum.  Also, we do not talk as frequently, because I have been only letting her initiate the communication, but it still seems she wants to be friends or at least hang out.  I have not been rude to her and have been polite when we talk, but I keep short and to a minimum.  I feel as though I haven’t moved on yet, but she continues to reach out to me.  When she does speak with me now, she seems a lot nicer to me than she has in the past, but now I am the one acting cold.

Ultimately, I want her to be happy and she knows this, even if she is not with me.  But, I am too unhappy remaining friends with her at this point when I still have feelings for her.  The rejection stings too much right now.

TL,DR; A good friend I have feelings for told me to move on, so I have distanced myself and don’t communicate with her as much.  However, she keeps communicating with me and will ask me to hang out.  I still have feelings for her, but being around her reminds me of the rejection.
"
I don't know what I want.,"I'm typically a well-composed, well put together individual. I'm rarely sad or upset and even when I am, it's never very serious and has never lasted more than a few days in the worst cases. 

Lately, though, I've come to realize that a lot of what I'm doing is just treading water. Going through actions because they feel like what I should do, not because I actually want to or have a real reason to. I want to find some purpose in my life, but I feel like I have none right now. I have everything I want, which is much more than I need. I just don't have any goals left, it feels.

There are goals I SHOULD have, like getting through college, making it  to nationals in debate, etc. I just don't feel like they are worth the amount of effort I would give them if I focused on them. They feel too easy. 

Any suggestions?"
I feel empty. Sorry for the incoherent wall of text. Just needed to say it all.,"I'm 23. My girlfriend and I are in a really bad place. We have dated on and off since we were 15. It never really worked out but we kept coming back to each other. A year ago, after not seeing each other for a year, we hooked up after a concert. I kinda dropped her after that. I didn't want to complicate my life and get depressed over her again. She use to be a really big partier. Raves, concerts, parties. She was forced to drop out of college because she was partying to much and doing a lot of coke. After telling me she was sorry about the past and that she has changed, eventually I decided to give her a chance. We have been together for the last year. It was all really good. We talked about moving in together. Ice never been happier with someone. Things have gotten really bad recently. In April she started working at a bar downtown and has gotten back into party mode. All she ever wants to do lately is drink. She has lied about going out. To be fair I can also be pretty controlling and question her on everything because of our long and rocky past. I feel like she has slowly lost respect for me. I'm pretty introverted and shy. I get really awkward and socially retarded. I feel like it embarrasses her. Which just makes me more shy and awkward. She is really popular with people and has a lot of friends. Most seem more like acquaintances. Most of my friends don't like going out and don't have the same interests as I do. This has caused me to put a lot into my relationship with my girlfriend. She has gotten to be my absolute best friend. But We have gotten into so many fights this summer. Every time we do something it ends up in a fight. She doesn't think we should move in together anymore because we fight to much. I blew up at her a week ago and told her how unhappy I was with everything and how mad I have gotten about how she has treated me. We decided to take a small break until this coming weekend. I can't fucking do anything. I can't concentrate at work. I can't enjoy anything. I can't get her off my mind. I just want to talk to her. Be with her again. Feel her next to me. I feel like a 15 year old again. I just want things to be how they were before she got that stupid job. I don't know how we can fix it. But I dont want this to be over."
Sports are becoming too mandatory and time-consuming to the point that it's not fun anymore.,"I like sports.  Some of the ones I've always wanted to do (football, archery, kickboxing, etc) have been closed because my parents wouldn't let me as a child because I am a girl.  But that aside, now that I'm at the high school level, I've been having problems and disappointments with the school sports.  So first, I can do track, volleyball, soft ball, soccer, crew, cheerleading, swimming, basketball, hockey, lacrosse, field hockey, and maybe one or two smaller ones I forgot.  But, people in these teams (except for some not at the middle school level like volleyball or track) have been doing this since 5th grade or less.  This first discourages me because I'm not the best athlete from the start, and I've had no experience in these (and for some like lacrosse, I've tried but hated when I was younger).  

So the problem of picking aside, if I do choose (lets say volleyball) it's so time-consuming I just don't think it's worth it some times.  Practice (minimally for a sport) is everyday after school for 2 hours during the season.  That, I can barely accept, because I'm in academically hard classes and other academic teams/clubs.  If you look at my swimming schedule, it's everyday after school and on weekends for 3 hours, and on Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat mornings at 5 for an hour.  That is crazy, especially when its year round.  Crew, same thing but also you're required to go to races frequently (one was in Florida during one of our spring breaks).  I just find this cruel.  I know, it's a high school level and they're trying to find the ""college"" worthy ones, but for the rest of the people who want to have fun, enjoy a sport they like, or get a good exercise (but not too much) are being put down and discouraged.

Sorry for this being more rant-like than a question.  I just don't know what to do.  I used to hate working out outside of sports, but recently I've almost gone a 180 on the idea.  

Since I was overwhelmed and didn't do any sports last year (except for track but then I was pole vaulting, kind of good at it, but I fell and sprained my ankle, my coach blatantly looked at my ankle and me, and made me do it again despite the fact I could barely step on it...I actually fainted and he didn't help, so that's why I dropped out of track for the lack of help and the fact they refused to acknowledge it.) I decided to try volleyball, basketball, and maybe softball for the seasonal sports.  

I don't know what I'm really trying to get at.  I just am frustrated with the school's sport system.  My school is athletic-oriented, and most people do a sport.  I want to do one, and it looks good for college, but it's just so consuming, not worth it if you aren't the best, and discouraging me.  

Thanks for listening."
I found out my ex has the exact same anniversary with his new SO as I have with mine (a year later). Can't figure out why it's bothering me so much.,"My ex and I broke up about a year and 3 months ago. We were together for several years, moved to the other side of the world together, and went through a lot together. It wasn't a nasty breakup - we didn't do anything horrible to each other. It was just very very sad and the whole experience had a big impact for both of us. Neither of us cheated or anything - we just slowly realized we weren't right for each other.

We've moved on. After taking several months without contacting each other, both getting into new relationships, and getting on with our lives, we met for lunch a couple times, saw one another at mutual friend's parties, and became facebook friends again... and it was OK. We don't talk much these days and I honestly think I am over him. I objectively see that he's not a bad person, he was just bad for me. I'm really happy in my life and a few months after our breakup I really never thought about him that much anymore and had moved on.

Anyway, out of the blue I saw a post on facebook about his 1 year anniversary with his new girlfriend. Turns out it's the *exact same day* as my anniversary with my new boyfriend - we were both celebrating our one year anniversaries in our new relationships at the same time without even knowing it. 

It freaked me out! I knew about them dating (and I'm fine with it). So why did it throw me off so much that it's the same day??? I just keep thinking about the day I got together with my boyfriend (who I am very happy with) and feel shocked to realize he was across town that very same night getting together with his current girlfriend. So weird!!

I think what's getting to me is somehow I feel like even though we split up, somehow we must have still been in sync to move on to new relationships at exactly the same time, and into serious relationships we are still in a year later. I am bothered by the idea that there's this person out there who I know extremely well, went through so much with, shared so much with, and had this very deep connection to (our relationship was really intense) - but now we have almost nothing to do with each other. There's something existentially disquieting about the feeling that gives me.  

Once you've been through an intense serious relationship with someone, do you ever really get over it? He wasn't my first love but he was my first ""grownup"" relationship and I guess I'm struggling to reconcile the role he played in my life (major) with who he is to me now in reality (minor)."
"I love him, but I think he's more preoccupied with the past.","I don't even know where to start with this one. I'm not sure how much of my problem is actually real and how much is insecurity, but I figure it's more productive to get it off my chest than to just stew about it. I'll try to make it as concise as possible.

...

I've been in long-term relationships before, but I can honestly say I have never felt as strongly about the people I've dated as they have about me. I was never the first to bring up ""I love you"" in a relationship, nor to push the whole public affection thing. I'm just not like that. I never really had any desire to get married and start a family with any of the previous people I dated, although most of them (except one abusive asshole) were, and still are, great guys. I've always had an idea of what my ""perfect"" candidate for a husband would be, although I wasn't sure I'd ever meet him.

About two years ago, I did meet a man who turned out to be... pretty much exactly what I was looking for. We took it slow, since I'd just broken up with someone a few months prior, and he also had apparently been through a very nasty breakup a year or two before (was in love with someone, but she left him before he could ask her to marry him) and wasn't in a rush either. We decided we'd just hang out as much as we wanted to, but not force anything.

Well, fast forward; we are now in a serious relationship. We do not technically live together, as we legally have separate dwellings, but we basically stay at one place or the other all the time. I've met lots of his best childhood friends, and also his family, and he has also met mine. He is the first person I've been with that I really consider to be a good ""team player"", since we are always able to help each other and work things out. We occasionally have disagreements, but we always discuss them and come to a mutual agreement. In short, things are going amazingly well...

...except I feel like there are some things he is keeping me away from, or keeping from me, one or the other. First of all, although he is quite open to introducing me to his male friends, he is very hush-hush about his female friends. He won't introduce me to them, and I actually have no idea if they're even aware he has a girlfriend. (There's one exception, a female friend he's known since childhood; he did introduce us, and he is well aware that I do not have an issue with him being friends with girls). He also has pictures around the house of other girls he's dated, one of which has been hanging directly above my side of the bed in his room ever since we met. I mentioned it once, and he really didn't give me a response. Whenever I have tried to (gently) bring up topics regarding long-term plans, or past relationships, he refuses to answer me and completely avoids the subject. He has never said he loves me, nor anything even remotely close, and while I do understand that not everyone is demonstrative in that way, I cannot shake the feeling that, although he obviously feels strongly for me, his feelings are likely not at the same level as mine.

I don't know what to do. I want to just tell him I love him, because... I do. I don't want to scare him away or put him under any pressure, though. It's not like I want to get married and start a family any time soon- few years from now would be great- but I want to at least know whether or not he sees this heading in that direction, and right now I have no idea. I feel like he's either still pining for someone in his past, or keeping his options open... I don't know. I just don't know what to do, and it's honestly been making me sick, just because I have never felt this way and it is so hard to keep my mouth shut.

TL;DR: in a great long-term relationship with a man I love, but I don't think he loves me back. Whenever I try to talk to him about related subjects, he refuses to say anything, and I think if I say ""I love you"" it might put him off completely. Not sure what to do."
"Her, it's all I think about any more. I can't stop it.","I can't sleep, I can hardly eat. I never thought it would happen to me like this. I thought breaks ups were easy and over with in a few days to weeks. It's been 2 months and it is ruining me more and more each and everyday. I live 4 hours away now, I'll never see her again in my entire life, I'm not going back there. I think about the guys she's with, what she's doing with them. Its destroying me. I can't focus on what needs to be done to improve my life. I can't keep myself distracted long enough. Nothing works, I just want to run away. I regrettably sent her a text message basically telling her what kind of hell I am going through and how much I miss her. Big fucking mistake I know but I'm weak. I know she doesn't want a commitment relationship, she wants to sleep around, do things with any dude she can find. I should realize that's she's just some sloozy that I should never have fallen for any way. Did she really ever mean those things she said to me? Where did it all go wrong? Was it me? Had to be me right? Maybe I was too clingy? Was I? Maybe it was her not wanting to commit. 

Whatever it was is driving me up the wall. I can't come back from this, not any time soon. Maybe if I had more friends around here it'd be easier. I have none here, I have none online. I'm all alone in the nightmare and nowhere to go. I'm not suicidal and killing myself over this would be ridiculous, but I want out so bad. I wish I could go back to when we met and just walked away. She had nothing good for me. 

Im not even re reading this for grammar and spelling. It was hard enough to type I'm not looking at it again. Thanks for reading if you did.  "
I'm part of a very close knit friend group and people have different feelings toward one another,"I'm a 17 year old in the UK and am at 6th form currently. The group of friends that I am part of is great, I am so lucky to be with them. We're all very alike and always enjoy spending time together (at least I with them) but recently, feelings have been bouncing around. This may take a little while, I apologise in advance!

There is around 5 of us that are the base of the friend group and then 3 others that are sometimes involved. We are all heavily into PC gaming and all in the same year at school. 1 of us is a girl and this hasn't been a problem ever until recently. We all study different subjects for a start but mostly don't go a day without talking to each other as we use software like teamspeak/skype etc to communicate if we happen to not talk at 6th form. We meet up regularly, theme parks, cinema, game nights (D&D etc). About 2 years ago was when we all really became close friends. One of the guys from our group (the closest to me, almost brothers) was dating the girl for a while and everyone I believe was absolutely cool with it. Eventually after a 2 year (I think) relationship they broke up but we're still great friends and it could almost be seen as it didn't even happen even though at some points they were the centre point of our group friendship now we're all equal in the friendship, no individual is above another which is great.

Move on to now, we're all closer than we've ever been, moving onto the next year of 6th form then on to University or whatever we're doing next. However, when we received our results, one of our friend group hasn't managed to get through to next year. There's everyone from every end of the achievement scale from A* students to D's and E's and we're all fine with that, though there was someone who used to be close in our friend group who dropped out a few months before we did our end of year exams and he moved to a college and now barely speaks to us bar meeting up every so often, I am afraid this may happen and also, it turns out that my friend who is leaving to study somewhere else due to results has recently told me they have feelings for the girl, it is believed he has for a while and it doesn't bother me though she has recently got a boyfriend whom isn't part of the friend group, this is the problem and I don't know what I can do about the fact that she's obviously not interested and he's so caught up with her he spends more time with her than anyone, not only that but the friend who had previously been dating her seems to feel that anything she does gets on his nerves he doesn't understand it and it can't be any form of jealousy as those feeling were present before she was dating but he also has a girlfriend now so he probably doesn't still have feelings for her.. It's all quite a lot and I don't understand why and I may be over thinking it but it's left me sleepless on a few occasions. 

Finally, to round it all up, I myself am afraid that when we do finally leave after this year we will struggle to stay in contact as we're all going to follow multiple different career paths and honestly, I am so close to these guys that they're like a second family and I can honestly say that I would take a bullet for any of them but I am just scared of the future and what it'll bring for such a close group of friends...

(EDIT1: Sometimes I add worlds like 'on and to' together like they're one word.. )

(EDIT2: Something else to add here, I've also noticed and mentioned to the female member of the group that as a group of friends we can talk about anything. Anything except sex and relationships. We do talk about some very strange things (in a joking way) but if you ever try to bring up something serious about sex or relationships or anything it's instantly backhanded out of the conversation by a joking comment, instantly making it no longer serious and it just gets skimmed over.)"
I've lost my girlfriends trust,"I love my girlfriend to bits. Shes amazing, but I got a fb messege from my ex the other day needing someone to talk to and a bit of advice as she just got diagnosed with bipolar.. being the nice guy I am I gave advice and was there to talk. My gf found out and wasn't to happy, she would have been fine with it if I wasnt so paranoid about her talking to her ex and guys in general.  I do admit I have come along way with trust since we first started our relationship, but now I have lost hers. I have been honest and said sorry and I wil never talk to the ex again. I just hope I havent screwed my relationship. "
A scientist dreaming of candy...,"I'm a graduate student studying neuroscience right now and I'm not overly thrilled with life. I like my boss and the work is okay, but I just can't see doing it long term. The idea of writing grants makes me want to stab myself repeatedly. Although I like teaching a lot, I received poor (and partially unjustified/untrue) evaluations for my first two semesters. I may not be able to get a teaching job because of those evals.

I've always liked to bake and cook. I'm a better baker than I am a cook, but most of all, I make fantastic candy. I can make your eyes roll back in your head with just one perfect bite and I can make an ancient professor and an young overworked assistant professor go giddy and do a happy dance when I bring in treats. Most of all, I love doing it. I love seeing people get excited over what is decidedly not low-carb or low-fat.

I've always wanted to open a bakery, but it's very consistently been a retirement goal. Tonight, I saw (yet again) an etsy seller selling homemade fudge for 18+ bucks a pound. I currently make 20k a year working 50-60 hours on a good week. Yes, it's for school, but it's still a very rough number. It's been suggested to me before to sell candy on the side, but I know my boss and the department would look down on me for it. Grad students aren't allowed to have other jobs and are usually frowned on for having hobbies. On top of that, my parents who are putting me through grad school, would not approve.

Honestly, reddit, I'm just depressed. I wish to be frolicking in a kitchen with sugar and chocolate. I want to be trying out new candy apple creations and thinking up new fudge confections. Instead, I'm in a lab supervising E. coli while it makes my protein of interest and sitting at a computer exporting files for hours a day. Thanks for listening."
I'm falling for my ex-girlfriend.,like the title says. i'm falling for my ex. we dated about 6 years ago and just randomly started talking again. we are having a lot of fun catching up and i find myself flirting with her again. the worst part is she is flirting back.... I really just don't know what to do. 
Going back to college is stressing me out.,"I will be a sophomore in college, and I feel much more anxious and worried about going back to school than I did last year. Now I know exactly how hard it is to be away from my best friends, family, and pets, and I am dreading having to leave them after only having a few short months with them. I don't adapt well to change, and for some reason college seems to be a hurdle I simply cannot overcome. Other people act so nonchalant about it, and I wish I could be like them.

I do have friends in college, but we're not as close and I think my sadness at being away from my best friends is causing me to have difficulty making and maintaining new friendships. I worry that my friends and I will grow apart, that we will all meet better friends and go our separate ways, and it's tearing me up inside. 

On top of this, I have strong feelings for a friend, and had many opportunities to express those feelings, but chickened out every time. In two days he will be moving ~1000 miles away to go to college. I know that ship has sailed, but it doesn't stop me from feeling deeply regretful.

I feel so overwhelmed. I wish I could just stop time. When I'm away at school I feel like I'm underwater-apathetically letting myself be carried any which way by the current, experiencing a muted, unhappy life and keeping myself going by thinking ahead to breaks and other times I'll see my friends. It's like I can't be fully happy without them, like I don't want to be.

Edit: forgot to add that my dad is taking my impending going away really hard. I hate seeing him so upset."
I feel like I'm disappointing everyone close to me and slowly starting to lose the people I care about the most,"I'm usually not one to come here and talk about what's bothering me or what's going on in my life but I have lost the only people I can talk to. I feel like if I keep this all in and don't say anything then it might become a problem to my health. I'm sorry if this sounds whiny, just gonna give it the best I can.

I recently got out of a lengthy relationship with the girl of my dreams. I know everyone says that about they're SO but this girl was absolute perfection. Perfect in every way and perfect for me. Due to unfortunate circumstances, we split. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a pretty good looking guy (don't know how to say that without sounding like a huge tool) so talking to other girls isn't an issue but I just don't have any interest in talking to anyone besides her. I could seriously tell her anything, no fear of judgement she would just listen and comfort and now I've lost that. I want whatever's best for her, to be happy whether its with me or not because she deserves that. I love this girl to death but I have no idea how I am suppose to move on with this.

On another plate, I have my family. Everyone in my family has done pretty well for themselves. Lawyers, doctors, etc. Safe to say that my family has a pretty high bar for hard work. I'm the only one who doesn't take everything so seriously. Everyone managed to get 4.5 gpas and straight A's and I managed to get some Bs and Cs . I am not going to a high end college to pursue a career interest that I have, I have no interests so far. I'm going to a college in state to save money and not waste it at a school where I don't know what I want to do. All of this constantly disappoints my parents. They deny it but it most definitely does. They won't even talk to me at times and its becoming harder to deal with day in and day out. I just feel like I'm the son who isn't going to do anything with his life.

My friends are off to college, my family ignores me and I have nobody to talk to about anything anymore. I have nothing to look forward to and nothing to do to deal with it all. At this point, what is the point? What is the point of all of this? I try so hard to give and not ask for anything in return. Is it too much to just ask for a break? I feel ridiculous for complaining about my problems when people have it so much worse than I do, I can barely deal with my problems and I feel pathetic about it. Does that make me a bad person? If I can barely deal with these problems now then how will I deal with the problems I'll have after college? All I really want is for those I care about to be happy whether or not I'm apart of their life, they're happiness is what is most important to me.

Thanks for reading if you did, I just needed some place to let go and say what I needed to. "
I've been feeling extremely anxious and untalented. I don't know what to do.,"Everyone seems to have at least one special talent or “calling.” I’ve never been able to find mine. I’ve tried many different things (drawing, writing, sports, baking, etc), but nothing ever stood out to me. I eventually found musical theatre which has been my creative outlet for years. I’ve been taking singing lessons for almost two years, but I don’t think I’m getting any better. I’ve been in seven musicals, but I don’t think my dancing skills have improved. I have auditions for Hairspray coming up; I’ve been planning to try out for the lead. But recently, I’ve been having second thoughts. I’ve been feeling much less than good enough for the role. I’ve been getting awful anxiety about the auditions; every time I think about them, I get this huge, aching knot in my stomach (which sucks a little bit since I’ve been thinking about them so much). I think that I need to relax and calm down a little bit, but I just can’t seem to and I’m not sure why. I'm so sorry that this probably just sounds like complaining, rambling, and it might sound pretty pathetic, but I feel lost. I don’t know what to do. "
My Mom,"Hey guys, I just need some advice about how to deal with my situation.  I am 19 and was adopted at 12.  I went off to college and I'm in my sophomore year and I love it.  Because of Coronavirus I have had to move back into my house earlier than expected.  I have severe Anxiety and I hate being home because it's the worst place for me to be.  My mom is super harsh and very blunt about everything.  I still get yelled at like a little kid for the dumbest reasons.  I know she loves me but at the same time I always want to not be here.  I hate being home because she's on my back 24/7.  She says she loves me but it's hard to really believe that when I have anxiety attacks on how to deal with stuff.  I really want to stand up for myself but I'm terrified of doing it.  I also want to leave because I don't want to be here because of everything.  I feel so much better by myself but I don't have anywhere to go til August.  She even threatened me of getting kicked out if I don't have a job by Friday.  I had an interview today and she yelled at me for wearing khaki shorts.  Like the job was for a dishwashing position.  She screams at me not even because I'm doing anything wrong but she's stressed about work.  She even hates my gf and I've been with her for 1year now and like she is the best person ever and I love her so much and my mom fucking hates her for no fucking reason.  I just need advice guys thank you for reading this.  Hope you all have a great day!"
Help,On my subreddit list all of a sudden a lot of my subreddits are not showing up. When i find them it says i am subscribed to them. But they are not in my list. How cone.  Can soneone help me? Thank you
Nobody listens to me and I hate it.,"Angry rant incoming. Lots of swearing.

My dad comes over multiple times a week and it sucks. He makes my sister cry, he yells at and starts fights with my mom, he refuses to leave me alone. I used to yell at him because he pissed me off so much, but he’d just laugh at me like I’m an upset 3 year old (maybe because there’s a language barrier between us and he doesn’t understand my angry outbursts, but regardless, fucking laughing at your Very Pissed daughter is not a very appropriate response) and get mad at me for getting mad at him because he’s my dad or whatever the fuck makes a person immune to being shitty nowadays.

You’d think my mom would be angry and want to do something about it too, especially since he’s been doing this shit for as long as I remember and she’s the main one he does it to, but no. When I complain to her and tell her that he’s a piece of shit (phrased a lot less aggressively, of course) she just tells me not to say that, not to think of him like that, don’t be so angry. But why the fuck *wouldn’t* I be angry? I’ve been dealing with this delusional asshole my entire life, chances are she’s been dealing with him for far longer, but apparently that’s okay for one reason or another.

My mom’s the least shitty person in my family but goddamn, she’s spineless and I hate it because that leaves me as the oldest child to do something about everything and I can’t even fucking do anything because nobody will listen to me. My mom’s all about being kind and shit, but she misinterprets kindness as letting people do whatever they want and not doing anything about it, so of course when I’m angry that my dad’s being a piece of shit, I’m being unreasonable and I shouldn’t be angrier that nobody’s listening to me or doing anything about it because we can all just *deal with it,* can’t we? No need to make a big deal out of it when we can just *deal with it* for the *rest of our fucking lives,* huh?

Now, I just stay as quiet and expressionless as possible when my dad comes over because he’ll just get bored if I’m not doing anything, but it’s so fucking infuriating when he says some stupid shit like “you were so happy when we all lived together and now that I’m not here, you won’t even talk to me,” and I can’t even do anything about it because if I say anything out of pure anger he’ll get upset because I’m mad at him for “no reason” and if I go to my mom to get him to piss off or at least translate what I’m saying to him, she won’t do jack shit. It is *so fucking frustrating* when I’m the only one really willing to stand the fuck up and do something, and it’ll never even fucking work because he won’t understand and my mom won’t translate.

And it’s funny because it’s ridiculously hard for me to really feel angry, and when I do feel genuinely angry, it’s nearly always because my other friends are involved. Never because I’m just pissed at someone for treating me like shit. I always feel sad, or hurt, or upset, but *never* truly angry.

But if a guy makes my friend (at the time) cry in gym class because she didn’t want to have drum class, I’m gonna yell at him after class until she has to drag me away herself to avoid causing a scene. If that same friend draws something in class and one of our other friends makes fun of a small part of it and shows it to everyone in a 5 mile radius to the point where she rips up the entire drawing but he keeps the piece he made fun of, I’m gonna get up and demand it back and stand my ground even when the teacher comes over (even though I’m afraid of authority figures) because I know damn well it won’t help the situation at all if he keeps it and my friend wouldn’t want that (though, next period I ended up unwillingly turning that anger into self hatred for making it a big deal). If one of my friends splits up the rest of our friend group because she wanted to know my best friend’s crush but my best friend didn’t want to tell her, I’m going to argue with her when we walk home together because that’s a stupid-ass thing to split up a friend group over and then text her angrily (I don’t remember what I said, but I probably cursed her out). If my best friend and I realize my other friend (from the gym class story) has been using me for money and treating our entire friend group like shit, I’m gonna feel betrayed because she used me but I’m gonna be pissed that she had the nerve to treat my friends that way. 

I don’t feel angry when I should, and you could ask any of my friends or my best friend about it to confirm that. I’ll let people treat me like shit (thanks, Mom) and not realize that I deserve better until my best friend (who has actual self worth) tells me that ain’t right.

My family, however, is the only exception. *Especially* my dad. My dad can literally knock and I’ll immediately recognize the weird-ass way he knocks on the window instead of the door and be pissed at the very fact that he dares to exist near us. He can just raise his voice a tiny bit at my mom and I’ll want so badly to yell at him to shut the fuck up. I can hear him take a single step on the stairs and want to scream at him to fuck off. He can say my damn *name* and I’ll want to shove him out of my room and lock him out forever (but, unfortunately, my door doesn’t have a lock). But I just keep my mouth shut and mentally yell at him until he finally leaves. At least that gave me insane self control, but I fucking *hate* everything about it and him and I can only wish I could do more. I *wish* I could do something like curse him out or be violent or *something* but fuck, is it hard when I don’t have any goddamn support."
Reasons to lose weight,"Hi. I’m 5’11” and 210 lbs. I am considered overweight and near obese for my BMI. 

I’ve lost weight in the past. So I know what I need to do but right now the only motivator for me to lose weight is just to be spiteful to everyone who never wanted me at my current weight and I don’t want to live that angry anymore. It hurts and leaves me feeling empty inside."
Cliche funny sad kid,"I’ve been at uni a year now and I have began to feel so alone, all my friends are hours away and I don’t see them often. The friends I’ve made here at uni are nice and I like them but they’re not the same, despite being surrounded by people all the time like course mates and flat mates I still feel so alone. I want to have someone here with me to talk to about our problems. I want a hug. 

When my course mates ask me to go out, I say no (I have been out with them before tho), I feel bad because I feel like they think I don’t like them, the reason I don’t go out is because I don’t like drinking or clubbing. So whilst they’re out doing something I don’t enjoy, I’m in my room alone left to myself. It’s so hard to speak to anyone about this because I am quite talkative and love to make people happy, and the way I act is totally different to how I’m feeling.

Going to uni is like a job, they’re my colleagues, and as soon as I’m finished for the day I’m all alone"
im just really sad,"i’m currently really busy with working towards uni and my exams are in may. everyone says that this time is absolutely crucial to doing well but nowadays i just find that i can’t be bothered. 

it’s not that i don’t want to do well, ive got a place i really want to go to, but i just don’t think i can do it anymore. it’s just a little bit out of reach i think, and at this rate if i don’t pick up the pace i really don’t think i’ll get there. 

which is another layer of stress altogether; the voice in my head is telling me to pull it together but even i know that’s not possible. i feel really lonely, don’t think anyone else should resort themselves to spending time with me, i’m boring and stupid, etc etc 

i want to make more friends but i can’t seem to apply myself into my own life. does that make sense???? i don’t even know"
The corporate world is nasty.,"This year I’ve learnt that cheaters actually do win. Hard work gets you nowhere. Especially if you refuse to give in to your boss of the opposite gender whose advances you’ve ignored from day 1. I’ve seen coworkers steal information and take all the credit. I’ve seen coworkers be wrongfully applauded for work they didn’t do. I’ve seen coworkers in a lower position than me get handed better opportunities and move past me and then been told that I’m not capable enough (believe me, that’s not true). I’ve seen other coworkers put up with this shit because there is no alternative. I’ve seen awards and rewards go to people who don’t deserve them and have had it dangled in my face. I’ve seen coworkers lie to make themselves seem hard working. I’ve seen it all. I could write for days about the injustice. And it bothers me at my very core because for years, bit by bit, day by day, I’ve had my spirit crushed and my self-confidence destroyed all because I refuse to give in to pervert who is threatened by my ability to surpass them. 

And I’m only 25. 

Sorry for the rant, But thank you for reading."
20yrs old and still have issues with self harm and self esteem,"I’ve self harmed for a very long time; off and on and only when I feel overwhelmingly sad or angry especially. I remember being 7 and getting scolded for biting myself and leaving large unsightly bruises on my arms.

It’s come to the point where I feel so immature and ashamed for doing it, I mean I’m an adult now and I’m not supposed to be doing that kind of behavior at work, school, etc. I just can’t stop. I have no insurance so therapy is put on hold (which I really do want to go see another therapist but the last one I had I honestly didn’t like, and I essentially ghosted on her. I’m clearly amazing at proper communication aren’t I?) I was previously diagnosed with C-PTSD, Major Depression, and Social anxiety, but I’m also wanting to pursue a possible diagnosis of ASD since I strongly suspect I’m on the spectrum. 

Last night work was terrible, and I dug my nails into the vein part of my inner elbows. It left awful looking bruise scrapes which straight up looks like I’ve been shooting up drugs. My managers had to calm me down twice that night. I’m still incredibly embarrassed that I sorta made a scene and I’m almost positive my coworkers are done with my shit.

I plan on trying to sign back up for state insurance and find a therapist who specializes in PTSD. If I don’t get approved then I’m more than likely on my own with paying for that. I also feel conflicted on therapy...Like nobody really ever *wants* to listen to me. I’ve tried pouring my heart out on Reddit posts and were only met with trolls who message insults. It makes me feel like maybe I’m just a horrible person and that people can even smell it from a Reddit post. That I don’t deserve help.

Is there anybody out there who can at least empathize with me? Or who can maybe give a lil distraction tonight?"
Pretty Toxic Work Environment,"Happy Tuesday/Wednesday!

I am a grad student at a prestigious university in the US. I am also a student worker in the online exam department and my job consists of answering student/professor/proctor emails, processing exams, and monitor students during exams. Sometimes, the workplace requires a lot of patience because it's so hectic and at other times, we can leave early. Anyway, our office consists of both staff and student workers, and lately, there has been a lot of tension between certain staff and students. For example, apparently everything in the common areas are only supposed to be used by certain people and this information was not given to us at the start of the job. I speak on behalf of the student workforce that we were not informed and we were using their coffee maker. So, how is it fine for them to use everything in our common area, but we can't touch a single thing in their common area? Like they have a fridge downstairs that they use,. yet they still feel the need to crowd our with all their crap (most of it has to be thrown out at the end of the week because it rots). I do not think this is fair or mature. 

Another thing the staff started complaining about regarded the fact that students left early on certain days. The policy for us is that we can leave early if there are no exams to process or if there are no emails: last Friday there were none and so a co-worker and I left 30 minutes early. I do not see how this is any concern of the staff, since they are not in charge of us. Only one staff person is our supervisor and, in the beginning, he permitted all of these behaviors. Also, it's a FRIDAY. So, like chill and mind your own damn business. 

A lot has been bothering me at this job. Not just these minor problems, but also how my boss has been editing our hours. The max we can work a week is about 25 hours. For example, I used to have three shifts a week consisting of 8 hours a day. That amassed about 24 hours, but once a month, we are required to work at least one Saturday for about 4 hours. Now, when you have amassed 24 hours for that week and you add in another 4 hours, you are at 28. The boss always said to allocate those hours somewhere else, but when I already work full shifts, there is nowhere I can place those extra hours to ensure that I get paid. Honestly, its bullshit and I reported everything to HR. They are in the process of investigating as we speak. 

&#x200B;

Other than the hours editing and the petty passive aggressive attitudes that get from others here, I have really been disappointed by this university staff's work ethic and the people they hire. Like what kind of twisted example are you trying to set? Half the staff in my department are extremely racist, they are very disrespectful, immature, and they are not appreciative of students who literally pick up their shit and cover the staff's asses. 

&#x200B;

I am really burnt out and disappointed."

i changed schools from my home country (hong kong) to the UK a year ago. just some background, studying abroad that far away from home isn’t uncommon here, so it wasn’t that strange when i decided to leave. i felt very confined in my old school, disconnected from classmates cuz the humour i developed from spending hours on end on the internet was very different from my peers, so i had a handful of friends and that was about it. when i left, i thought i would be exposing myself to a myriad of new people, some that might share a similar sense of humour, long story short that didn’t really happen, in fact, since i go to school in the middle of nowhere now, it’s probably worse since people barely use or are exposed to the internet in the same way people living smack dab in the heart of a city do.

tldr, i felt culturally isolated in my home country in terms of humour and conversation topics, moved countries to improve the situation, felt culturally isolated in a new country. i have a feeling it’s something to do w/ social anxiety as well, but has anyone else experienced similar problems when moving/studying abroad?

ps. i’m sorry if i make any mistakes w/ formatting or unwritten rules- i’m pretty new to using reddit (´；ω；`)"
Roommate's puppy needs some help,"Hello!

An old friend (Tom) and I got an apartment together several months ago. We had discussed him getting a puppy within a few months and I offered to do friendly roommate tasks like take him out if he wasn't home, feed him at noon, etc. if Tom wasn't available. I knew he was struggling financially so long shifts would be inevitable. I wanted to make sure we had a plan on keeping the puppy cared for while we were working.

Then Tom goes and buys a 9 week puppy (german shepherd/husky mix, it's amazing) with no warning days after our discussion. Frustrated but trying to keep the peace I try to offer resources, another friend who works at a pet store with knowledge on training and merch discounts, local vets to handle shots and things, anything Tom could need to raise a puppy comfortably.

The issue is all that happened a month ago. Since then he's refused to potty train (beyond laying mats and what he calls ""light swatting"" when the puppy has an accident), refuses to replace destroyed items, takes him out for walks maybe once a week or so, it took 2 weeks for him to get his first round of shots but he still took him around the apartment with other dogs and to some parks (thankfully puppy appears ok), and uses the kennel as a discipline tool and for when he leaves (usually from 7am to 4-6pm).

At the beginning when I realized he wasn't going to actively potty train I offered daycares that could do it for him. Even for a month would be enough for the puppy to start training but he's refused saying it's too expensive. I offered to help care when he's away but as I saw him take less and less an active role in training and refusing to consider my concerns and lack of cleaning up after his puppy (our whole apt smells like dog pee and the floors are all sticky) I stopped taking care when he's at work. I'd hoped Tom would take it as a sign to fix something in his treatment, and told him if he did anything to start actively training again I would start helping him in the afternoons again but he refuses.

At this point the puppy screams (not whimpers or whines, it sounds like torture) every couple hours until Tom gets home. Apparently it's been like that the past several weeks according to my neighbors. I'm at a loss for what to do. Tom refuses my help but wont train his puppy. Won't pay for a trainer or daycare saying it's too expensive. I'm trying to see if the apt complex can force some action on behalf of the puppy but they haven't received complaints from neighbors so they won't step in. 

If anyone can give some advice with the puppy's best interest I'm all ears. 

tldr: roommate has a puppy he doesnt train, expects me to be ok with it until he is (by magic apparently)"

"Broke up with my gf, got completely trashed at my works christmas Party and living alone for the first time...I think that’s my low point.","I moved in with my gf of 3 years into a perfect apartment. We got very lucky with that. 
Everything’s was going well. 
I found a new job, was happily living with my gf until the last couple of months everything went to shit. 

She was completely focused on her job, working late every night and was the kind of person who didn’t love to take care of other people. 
We decided to break up. 
Her parents helped her move out like a week later and I was stuck in a half empty apartment until i found a new flat. 

It was really hard focussing on work during this time. 

Now last Friday was our big Christmas party and I (a student who works part time) was one of the last guests. I have a little blackout and don’t know how I behaved during this hour. 
I remember sitting right at the end with our young CEO (37) completely trashed, too and I was so dumb to say something like „haha, I guess „name“ is done, too. Perfect“. 
I felt super good and had good conversations with everybody, still I’m really worried what happened during this hour. 
I don’t know, if I passed out, fell, danced, had a good time or bad time. 
I think I’m getting fired for the first time tomorrow and I’m freaking out. 

The only thing im hoping for, is, that since I was there until the end, it couldn’t have been that bad. If I would‘ve been really rude or misbehaved, they would’ve asked me to leave. "
My cat hates me,"She was initially my boyfriend's cat since she was a kitten and was notorious for only snuggling with him. When I moved in with my partner, she took time to warm up to me, but after some time she would snuggle up with me as well. She spent an entire winter in our room with us, that was her favorite place. We moved rooms, and she moved with us.

Then I visited home for a month, and as far as I know, she was still snuggling with my partner that whole time. When I came back, she wanted nothing to do with me. At first I thought she needed time to adjust, but the other cats warmed up to me quickly. Our cat refuses to be in our room. She runs away from me, and has even been mildly hostile towards me. I was hoping she would warm up after a week or so but its been two months. Getting along with her like we used to is important to me. I don't know what's happened."
My cat died today,I'm going to miss my little Kitt.. She was so cute and feisty.. Why do we all get let's knowing someday they will die and leave us sad and depressed? I'm just wondering this today.. Cause I'm sad and depressed... 
I wish I would have never gotten this job at the fucking railroad,"I've been on this job with the railroad for the past 2 months now. Everything about it is awesome, the pay, the benefits, and the retirement as well. I'm getting a little bit more comfortable with doing some of the work and hopefully will be passing the conductor's certification test in 2 weeks. But the problems are what the work schedule is, or rather lack thereof. You are on call 24/7, with no guaranteed days off. So I can't make plans for anything or with anyone. Essentially, I can't have a life. And the only reason that's a problem for me is because I'm only 19, turning 20 in a month. I'm wondering if I didn't start this job too early and am giving up my social life. I want to railroad, I just don't know if it's the right time. And to top it all off, everyone in my family is so happy for me. My dad's good friend helped me get the job here. My dad gets so excited when I talk about my job and so do all of his friends when they hear about how I'm doing. My mom and stepdad are the same way. My dad told me the other day how proud he was of me. So now if I quit, no matter what I do, everyone will be so disappointed. And they'll always think or tell me, ""You had a really good job with the railroad,"" ""This new job you have isn't as good as the railroad."" I honestly wish I would have never gotten this stupid fucking job. Because now I'm stuck no matter what the fuck I do."
I'm just kind of shit at everything,"So yeah, the title pretty much sums it up. I'm shit at everything, or at least not very good at anything. Video games are my primary passion, and I've never been any good at them. Not horrendous, but never better than average. Drawing? I have no artistic talent, I've practised loads and never gotten anywhere. I can write academically, but my fiction is awful. I'm not unfit, and can perform in sports, but you wouldn't want me on your team. The only reason I played soccer as long as I did is my friends were compassionate enough to let me play with them. Programming? I'm not particularly logical anyway and despite it's what I want to do with my life I'm desperately mediocre at that too. Music? I've tried learning the guitar and the piano, never any good at either despite taking lessons for over a year with guitar, I can't sing for shit either. Warhammer? I like to play, have done for 4 years, can't paint for shit though. I just feel like I'm not good at anything. "
My cat isn’t adjusting to our new home,"I recently moved to a new house and my 15 yr old cat is having a hard time adjusting. She mostly stays in my bedroom. One of the things she’s having the biggest problem with, I think, is the floors. Her whole life I’ve lived in homes with carpet, but now I have hardwood floors. On the rare occasions she comes out, I can tell she wants to play, but she can’t seem to get the hang of running on hardwood floors, so she gets spooked easily and then just hides. Over time she’s lost interest, or started to fear, all of her old toys. She’s always been skittish, but now I don’t seem to even have ways to reward her occasional bravery, aside from treats. Thing is, I can tell when she gets wound up and wants to run around, but she just can’t do it. It was a really good and necessary move for me, but I feel really bad that she’s not coping well. "
Loss of mother,My mother just passed away day before yesterday and my relationship with my dad is strained.. I don't know how to grieve.. What will I do? 
Anyone else feel like being sensitive and empathetic just isn't worth it anymore?,"I've been raised pretty much my entire life to always put everybody else first... to set myself aside and worry about how others are feeling, to consider everyone else's feelings before my own. To treat everyone else how I would want to be treated.

Which would be fantastic, I think, if everyone was raised the same way. But they're not. Time and time again, I end up being ignored; people turn on me, take advantage of my kindness, refuse to show me the same respect I show everyone else, and generally just talk down to me like I'm an idiot because I actually consider the possible results of my actions on the people around me.

The worst part about it, though, is trying to change. Telling yourself ""I don't want to be nice and empathetic anymore."" The same people that show you callousness and lack of empathy get really, really angry when you reciprocate with the way they treat you. I'm sick of being hurt because of being empathetic, but when I try to stop being empathetic and just start living for myself, I'm suddenly a villain--when the people around me were already doing exactly that in the first place and got away with it fine!

It just seems like if you put yourself forward as a kind and caring person from the start, everyone wants to take advantage of you and when you stop being easy to take advantage of, they start abusing and hating you. Yet, if you put yourself forward as callous and uncaring from the very start, they don't really bat an eye. They think ""Oh, another one of those guys. Whatever."" and continue about their daily lives... and are pleasantly surprised when you show you CAN be empathetic and kind when you want to.

I just fricking hate how ludicrously backwards and unfair it is. If you try to be nice to people by showing basic human decency, you become their doormat. If you instead raise people a flying middle finger and refuse to offer anybody simple kindness or empathy, you're rewarded with affection and approval for showing even the slightest bit of basic human decency at all.

I hate it. I hate it so much. I hate being this way. I don't want to be nice anymore but I also don't want to anger the people that already EXPECT me to be nice. It's not fair. What the ever-freakin'-loving-heck-on-a-stick are people like me supposed to frickin' do?"
Every time I fail it reminds me of how much I really hate myself,"I'm no good at anything no matter how hard I try. Even the things I like to do. I play video games for escapeism but just end up getting mad because whenever I lose it reminds me of how I'm not even good at them. 

My grandfather hates me because I can't do anything right. I'm pretty sure my father lies to himself that I'm worth something. He's good at everything and I'm just a disappointment.

I am 21 and I never had a girlfriend before?,"So I am 21 male and I never had a kiss or even had a girlfriend before and this kind of bothers me. I am currently living in Las Vegas and go to college on Tuesday and Thursday from 11 am to 6pm. When I am not in class or doing homework I have a lot of free time on my hands. So I joined a few dating sites like OKCupid, POF, Tinder, and a few others. I have been interested in a relationship with another woman but I just do not have the transpiration to do that. I can only go to places wherever my dad goes or if I were to use the Bus. The bus cost like 3$ or more depending on where I want to go.



I have managed to get girls to like me in the past before during school. I never went out with them because at the time I was not allowed to date till I was 16. I have had a couple of girls like me maybe even more because I may have been oblivious to them. In high school during my senior year I noticed that everyone was hooking up with someone and this got me really jealous. Even one of my friends who was really weird managed to get a girl to like him. However, I never have been in a relationship and even now when I got to college I am still single. I have managed to get several replies to me on dating sites like OkCupid and POF. A couple of them are mistresses who are looking for a submissive male and they seem really nice and attractive. I am currently talking to one of them but I am not so sure how the relationship is going. I never had a girlfriend before and this is kind of depressing for me. I would like to get a girlfriend sometimes soon because I fear that I will be forever alone in the relationship department.

"Jack of all trades, master of nothing: I'm okay at like everything I do, and don't want to abandon anything, but I'm not like, exceptional at anything.","When I was younger, I learned to play the piano, got good enough to impress people, then picked up guitar, did the same, then drawing, then writing, then a ton of other things.

It's diverse, but truly mediocre. 

What do I do? I know I can't be a master of everything, but I can't bring myself to abandon anything. There aren't enough hours in a day, and this damn website sucks up so many of them.

I just realized this. Like, a few days ago. I lived my whole life thinking I was great because I'm kind of okay at a lot of different things. Now I know that it's not how life works. A two ton pile of shit, no matter how large, is still nothing compared to a little teeny diamond.

Am I pretty?

Sometimes I feel pretty, but other times I feel like I'm deluding myself. There are *so* many girls who look super good and I feel like, compared to them, I'm less attractive because of the abundance of beautiful women. I'm sure this mini-obsession will past in a few days but it has really been all over my head.

I'm not even sure why I care. I don't think the knowledge would make any difference in my life. In all honesty, I'm more of a personality person but, for some reason, this has been bothering me. Maybe because I'm anxious that I won't find a partner or something? I don't know. I wish that there were something existed that could tell me, objectively, if I am pretty. 

Sorry-- this feels semi-ridiculous to post but it has really been bothering me :( "
I'm fucking pathetic!,"God I'm fucking pathetic! I'm 17 and a couple months ago I made the decision to stop going to public school and start doing homeschool. This cost my parents a decent amount of money. I couldn't bring myself to go to school in the morning, I couldn't bring myself to do anything I was so depressed I didn't want to get out of bed. I just wanted to sit on the computer all day, I had fucking no one at school anyways so I decided to try home school. 

Well that was 4 months ago and I haven't left the house in 2 and a half months or so. I'm so depressed, I've never been this depressed. I haven't been doing my school work lately so my parents grounded me from the computer, this just made things even worse for me and I've spent the last week in bed beating myself up. I'm so fucking lazy, I have 0 motivation. I can't even bring myself to cut myself like I usually do when I'm this depressed.

I haven't gotten a haircut since school started, I don't shower as often as I should, I have wisdom teeth that need to be taken out, I have cavities that need to be fixed, I need to go to the eye doctor to get more contacts and I need to go the doctor to get different medication because it's obviously not fucking doing anything for me.

We usually play football in the summer and explore the woods with our snowmobiles in the winter, but we got snow a few weeks ago, but there's not enough for us to go snowmobiling.

I've asked people for tips, and they've said that we could go to the movies (can't afford it more than once a month), driving around town with our cars (no one has a car) or go out drinking (which we do, but only on weekends).

My dad has cancer but I'm still struggling to forgive him for being a crappy parent [long],"I haven't typed this out yet and I know it's going to be long. Please stick with me.

I feel like I've repeated some variant to this story to enough counselors, social workers, and various people on the internet that I should know how to introduce all of this, yet every time I find myself paralyzed.

I wouldn't condemn my entire childhood to say that I had a miserable one, but when I recall the early years, there's just this overtone of pain that bleeds through even my happiest memories. Maybe it wasn't just my dad, but his absence and general jackassery (and plenty of other confounding factors that make me hesitant to point a finger in any specific direction) leaves me wondering if my issues with intimacy and men are correlated with him.

Maybe I should have introduced myself for context first. I am a nineteen year old university student. I live mostly alone in an off-campus apartment and ""rent out"" my space to friends who need a place to crash in exchange for financial help of some sort (even if it's just getting beer), but the lease is still in my name. It sounds sketchy, but how else do you get by when you're a broke student who works part-time at a grocery store? Sell dope? Whore myself out?

Well... I suppose what's bothering me is my relationship with my father for the last nineteen years. I realize, retrospectively, that he struggled with bipolar disorder (and I am sad to see my sister exhibiting many symptoms of his illness already at age seventeen). He would hole up in his home office or in bed whenever he wasn't at work, mope about, sustain on junk food, and be generally as psychologically disengaged from the family as possible while still physically being there. When manic, his spending would put the family in crippling debt despite making a software engineer's salary. He'd stay up all night feverishly writing code convinced he's conceived some billion-dollar website idea. As you may imagine, nothing really took off. My (maternal) grandmother still recalls my mother's frantic phonecalls to her, begging for help on the bills. Of course, when my grandma sent my parents money, asshole dad always spent it on some new gadget.

Of course, he had a short temper, and there was plenty of collateral damage following every ""explosion."" He'd hit me in the same fit of manic hysteria he'd break a lamp or a door hinge-- the literal fucking manifestation of ""blind rage."" He neglected my sister and I-- not out of malice, but with this toddler-like ego-centrism in which any inconvenience caused his daughters to temporarily disappear. I'm sure I'd have starved to death if he were a single parent. I grew up lonely and resentful, and lived my adolescence trying vainly to fill this paternalistic Freudian void with a slew of shitty boyfriends. My mom was a classic enabler, so any complaints about him were negated with a reminder that I should be grateful that I even have a dad. What a turn of fate now, huh?

This setup stagnated until my senior year of high school. Dad tried to kill himself-- for real this time-- and while in the psych ward he spilled to my mom that he was having an affair, and that he was going to divorce her for this woman once he got out of the nuthouse. Mom becomes a basketcase, and though I was stoic for a few months, eventually I crack and become one too. My sister (who is autistic, which I should have added) never verbalized her feelings, but starts acting out more than usual and begins to exhibit manic depressive symptoms. After a shitty year, I still manage to get into college (my grades suffered horribly, so a public university instead of the private one in New York I had my heart set on. C'est la vie.) and move out after a semester. Things settle down and my family picks itself back up. My dad got remarried, and I actually ended up liking my new stepfamily, especially my stepbrother whom I have a lot in common with. My mom underwent therapy and eventually decided to date again. Her current boyfriend is a saint and I'm infinitely proud of her for not picking out another Dad. I mean, this guy is amazing. She was having issues seeing the house and being reminded of her former marriage, so what does he do? He motivates her to renovate nearly the whole house and even helps fund it, happily taking on a good bulk of the ""grunt work"" himself. Seeing the house in such a different light (literally, they finally replaced that shitty old light fixture in the bathroom that hasn't turned on since the Bush administration) has helped me tremendously as well when I come back to visit. I've been on the Dean's list every semester and I'll be graduating a year and a half early. I felt alright. I was a bit of a lone wolf, but god damn did I feel liberated. I had my cozy own apartment that I could decorate however I pleased, amazing friends, and even though my mother didn't have much backbone when I was growing up, I'm realizing how much I love and need her, and how wonderful she and my grandparents are. I didn't have a romantic partner (and I'm going back and forth about my sexuality, but that's another thread), but I still felt fulfilled and content.

Then the cancer. Stage four stomach cancer, to be exact.

I feel so conflicted. I love my dad, I always will-- even if I only love the idea of him. But I'm still trying to forgive him. When he was suicidal, I anticipated losing him constantly. But after every ""false alarm"" like a 3am phonecall that just turned out to be my drunk friend, I realized that I will never be prepared to lose him. I just can't fucking dismiss the sick irony of dying only after you chose to live.

I've barely cried about it-- I kept myself busy enough to avoid processing my grief. Now that I have time, it simply can't remain ignored. 

I just don't want him to die before I learn to love him without resentment."
I was hoping my blood results came back abnormal...,"At least I'd have an explanation as to why I feel depressed and have been for 6 years.

I cant even cant even go shopping without going into full depression and beating myself down,"I just went shopping for some sunglasses.

I hate myself and its so exhausting feeling so defeated."
"I got offered some good things in my life, now I'm having a nervous breakdown","My current job is great--I feel fulfilled every day, I get along with my coworkers, and I feel like I'm contributing positively to the office.

I got offered a job that is 35% higher pay, has similar benefits, and honestly just looks like a better opportunity in general.

I have the job offer paper in front of me. and I'm just unable to call the numbr and officially accept the position.

I hate change, I am already depressed, and I am terrified of uncertainty.

I don't know what to do. There is no intelligent reason NOT to take the job. But I just can't and I know it's just my anxieties getting in the way--it's not an instinctual ""bad feeling"".

"I always wanted a FWB relationship, but now that I'm in one I'm not sure it's what I want","I've wanted a friends with benefits type of relationship for years now, and I've started to reconsider what it is I actually want now that I'm (sorta) in one.

I've known this girl for the past 5 or so years, ever since high school but she went somewhere else. We were actually fairly decent friends for a long while but she left for college out of state while I stayed near home. Whenever she'd come back in town, we'd hangout and somewhere in there we started hooking up.

Let me clarify, we've never had proper sex but we'd done plenty of other stuff and would proceed to whenever she came to visit. Then somewhere in there, she cold-shouldered me the next time she came to visit. No making out or anything even. It kinda threw me for a loop, and I just figured she was over ya boy. Whatever, I'm grown, I'll move on.

Still though, I'd see her around holidays with our mutual friends and knew something was still there. Another drunk makeout session one New Years proved it. After college, we both ended up out of our hometown and were talking one day. We ended up on how we used to hook up and how that all stopped and why. She said she didn't want to feel like that was all we were about, which I respected, and we both said we wanted to go back to the way things had been when we were hooking up.

Since that talk, I moved back home which is significantly closer than before but still 3-4 hours away from her. I've tried texting her on a semi-regular basis, but to me it seems like she's spotty at best about it and not into it at worst. And I've never even tried sexting before with her (even though I want to) which makes me think maybe it's some kind of a boundary thing.

I've never been in a FWB situation so I think part of it is I'm not sure of the rules, but it always seemed to me that we had a deeper bond than just a hookup because we were good friends beforehand. I'm also afraid that maybe I'm just catching feelings, which is a no-no is this kinda situation, especially if she's 4 hours aways with no intent to return soon. I also think it might just be that I'm not ready for something that's purely sexual and romantically uninvolved. I know I'm a romantic and while I have a certain ability to turn that off if this were something like a one night stand or I just wanted to ""hit it and quit it"", it's not the way this situation is. Hell, we almost had a falling out years ago when she thought I MIGHT have feelings for her, so I'm not sure if anything's changed since then but I do wanna clarify what's going on without losing the FWB relationship in the process.

Maybe I'm just in some sort of gushy stage right now, maybe we just need to talk it out to figure out what we expect from this and where our boundaries are, maybe I just need to actually have sex with this girl or maybe I should propose a sort of open relationship with her in the meantime."
I feel like I have no one to talk to.,"Today I got into a fight with my mom about something so stupid it's irrelevant. But now she is really mad and will not speak to me. 

I apologized to her but she just said that she doesn't want my apology and has not talked to me since. It's been a few hours now. 

I tried talking to my boyfriend about it but he doesn't seem to understand my family dynamics since they're different from his. I cancelled plans with him tonight because I know that leaving would just make the situation with my mom worse. And I think he might be mad.

I have no close friends who I can talk to about something so personal. So, my hope is that strangers of the internet will be helpful and offer some advice if not just say something nice.

I guess what's really bothering me at this point is that I just feel like I'm all alone."
In 3rd year college and also 18 (M). Still single?,"I never had the courage to ask a girl out or where to even start. I'm very open and can make small talk with any people easily but I just can't think of myself having the courage to ask a girl. I get along with all of the girls in class but my fear is that when if i asked someone out and refused, It will get awkward and I never liked that. 

I think I'm going to be single for the rest of my life if I keep doing this.

Love doesn't exist.,"You came into my life out of nowhere. What started as little nothings became something life changing. I never expected you'd become my everything, and that I'd fall for you. I didn't expect for me to mean so much to you, or so I thought. I didn't expect for me to try again, to keep going. But you inspired me. 

But. Then again, you were always waiting for someone else, weren't you? Your best friend was right there, and it didn't matter how many hours we spent together. How much it seemed like I mattered to you or how much you mattered to me. It all ended right then and right there, the second he asked for it. The second he said it. 

Looks like I'll never actually be good enough. But hey, congratulations. You got me to believe I could be. Before you shat on my soul.

There's one thing I've learned in life. And that is that everything you want seems to fall right into your lap, and then poof, it's gone. You're even worse off than you were before it came into your life.

I didn't even know I was sad and lonely until she came into my life,"I used to live with a roommate who was never home. I'm used to being alone and I thought I was fairly happy. Recently, some friends who live nearby were renting their room. They were travelling and NYC rent is expensive so they wanted to Airbnb the space. One of the persons renting was this girl (let's call her Lilly) who was on summer break and taking classes in the city. She was going to use their room for a month. However, there were two weekends she couldn't stay because someone else already booked it or something. My friends asked if I could let her sleep in my room for those two weekends (I have a bunk bed setup). She could even sleep on the couch but I was ok with her using my bed. 

I didn't think much of the arrangement since I had another friend staying with me for a week. She was also visiting the city to see friends and interview for some jobs.

My friends were taking Lilly out for lunch and invited me to meet her. When I first met her she had a lot of eye shadow on, like a panda, her hair was deranged, and she wasn't very talkative. Now, these friends are international students so they spoke in their native lounge. I'm of the same nationality but was raised in America so I understood a decent amount but a lot is lost in translation. Everyone was talking with each other and I added to the conversation when I understood what was going on. I asked Lilly some common questions like what she was doing in the city what and how she found out about the place. She found them by chance and because they were the same nationality, it just clicked. After lunch, I went home and continued my day like nothing happened. Video games, internet, television...

When the weekend of her first stay came, she showed up and thank me for letting her stay in my apartment. She settled her stuff down and thanked me again before leaving. She still had the heavy eye shadow on, which was kind of cute at this point.

Night came and she was nowhere to be seen. I figured she was just out with friends so I went to sleep around 1am. A few hours later and I hear her trying to open the door (it's a tricky lock). I wake up to let her in and she apologize profusely for waking me up. She apologized a lot. The weekend pasts and we don't talk much. I was usually on my computer and she would usually wake up and go to the other apartment since most of her stuff was there. I guest she didn't want to burden me any further than she already has using my mattress.

I lent her some spare keys and when the weekend ended, she was very sad that she had to return them. She really liked the apartment because there was a lot of lights and the windows had a beautiful view. Because she was staying a second weekend, I thought it would be harmless to let her keep it until then. I even said it was ok for her to hang out in my apartment while I was away at work. She was very gleeful after hearing this and thanked me. I didn't see her very often after this point. 

She stopped by once with ice cream and fruits as gifts to thank me for being so generous. I was really caught off guard by the gesture because it was nothing but also because she got a haircut and stopped wearing her eye shadow. She was so cute. Her short hair complemented her adorable round cheeks. Her lack of eye shadow brought out her eyes. There was a brilliance to her face I couldn't stop looking at. It was too late at this point, my body went full ""fall in love"" mood and I didn't realize this until long after the fact. At the time, I didn't give it a second thought.

The second weekend, Labor Day weekend, was where it all went wrong. For me, if I fall for a girl, I need time away from her to digest my emotions and make sense of it from a logical and practical point of view. Are we compatible? Do we share interests or have things in common? Are her interests and passions sustainable for a long term relationship? Will my parents like her if I married her? Wait, really Brain? You've spent less than 24 hours with her and you're thinking marriage? Maybe you should start with asking her on a date? ""NOPE!""

When the second weekend started, we were more familiar with each other. I wasn't on the computer as often. She really disliked people who were passive couch potatoes who weren't passionate about something other than video games and wasting time, which is fair. I didn't stop because of her thinking this but because I needed to be a better host. We began talking more that weekend. Well, she talked and I listened. She loved Japanese literature and reading books in general. She hated clichés and really liked movies about life and its absurdities. She didn't care for plots or graphics or famous actors, she cared for its surrealism, irrational juxtaposition. ""So lame!"" she'd probably say after reading this paragraph. Probably wouldn't make it past the first few sentences... At some point, she spoke for near 5 continuous hours about books I should read and why she liked them. That happened a few times. 

As the weekend drew to a close, she grew very sad at the realization she had to return to Boston for school. She dreaded the idea of leaving NYC and especially the idea of leaving my perfectly located apartment with its view into traffic and abundance of natural light. Her destination was a basement in Boston. I asked when school started and if she wanted to stay longer? She had the Labor Day week left before starting the following week. She took my offer to stay a week longer and I was happy she did, at the time.

It was Monday night and she was gone somewhere. I had spent almost the whole weekend in her company and it hits me, she was leaving and I was upset. I had too much exposure in too short a period of time. I didn't realize what was happening because I didn't have time to digest. I wasn't prepared for how I was going to behave.

Thinking I was bored, I began to drink. And drink some more until I hit that sweet spot. She came home and saw I was drinking and wanted to join in. I offered what liquor I had stocked and she took a few sips. 

We began talking about everything. A bit too much really. Then I showed her the love of my life, a girl I met while interning in my native country. Lilly said I could do better, the girl looked fake in her pictures. I didn't care because I remember the memories I had. Both our heads were spinning. I had work tomorrow. She needed to pick up a friend that night. I offered to accompany her but she said I needed to sleep for work tomorrow. I just wanted to spend more time with her. I pressed the issue. She kept denying me. Then she said I wasn't smart enough to accompany her. Being already upset, I dropped it and said, ""Fine, I don't care."" I don't remember a lot of what happened that night but I remembered this scene. She was upset and said I shouldn't say that. She said I should care for something and I said I didn't care for anything. I kept repeating myself and told her she needed to get her friend. She also repeated herself, ""You need to care for something, anything."" I asked her what she cared about and she said, ""I care for you."" But she only told me this so I would go to sleep... and when did she start holding my hands...?

Stop here if you want to make up a story about how it was a happy ending and everything worked out. 

I was hung over the next day. She was sleeping on the couch under the bunk bed. I showered and put myself together for work. It was a long day but I couldn't wait to get home and see her. It was too late though, the initial damage was done. 

After she left to pick up her friend, I exploded with expletives and repeating, ""IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THIS WAY!"" Over and over. I didn't see her for most of the day. Night came and I couldn't sleep. She was reading and we ended up talking, recollecting what happened the night before. Apparently I was less reserved, more lively, spoke in my native tongue, and was very amusing. I was also very moody, ""Drama bitch."" The literally translation was, ""ricecake."" Emotionally volatile. She said it reflects weakness. I should be more like her, always happy and whimsical. I couldn't take it and I just broke. I said anything hurtful I could, calling her rude, immature, and inconsiderate. It didn't seem to faze her. She said she was stubborn and didn't like people lecturing her. She'll hear what she wants and ignore everything else. She'll let the good affect her life and ignore the bad. This is how I should have lived my life but I cared too much about what others thought about me. If I had just let it go then, I might not be so bruised. But she got to me.

I left her a note the next morning apologizing for what I said but the deed was done. I was no longer her generous host. She no longer loved the apartment she so coveted a week earlier. She was there for a week but I never saw her, only when I woke up for work.

She moved her stuff out yesterday. My room's no longer cluttered. I didn't even know I was sad and lonely until she came into my life. Now she's gone and my last memories of her are the exchange of hurtful words. All because I wasn't confident enough to tell her how I felt. Even if she didn't reciprocate, it would have been enough for her to know how I felt about her entering and leaving my life so suddenly.

And I can hear her now, if she were ever to read this, ""So lame!"" Thanks for the memories Lilly.

"One of those ""what am I even doing here"" days.","I don't feel any drive or sense of purpose. Nothing calling to me. I don't know what I want to do, and I don't feel like it has much to do with being young. I don't see it ever just coming to me.

Should I be taking more steps to try to find my purpose? Myself? Am I spending too much time with simple pleasures?

I just feel detached from my surroundings. I don't see any point today.

But the numbness of the comfort zone that is my life can be, well, comforting, until I start thinking about it again. I go back to being scared to change anything.

I don't feel fulfilled, but I don't know what would make me feel fulfilled either. I'm stuck being undriven, unsatisfied, and pointless."
Just your average teenager's trouble with girls,"I am a male 17 years old boy with the - I feel like - average trouble with girls.

So, very basically, what's bothering me, is that I am interested in 3 different girls and am completely unsure about who to ask out, or not to ask out one at all, since I intend to finish my school in May 2015 and then move 500km away to study in my old hometown.

The first girl, I am really only interested in because she shows interest in me, and isn't ugly. Of course, her character is fine, but without her being interested in me, I wouldn't be interested in her at all. She is in my a few on my classes and a little bit older. 

To the second girl I am interested because I like her character in general, she is interested in computer science like I am and she seems to like me.

The third girl is a grade below me, and we started talking to each other on the bus drive home pretty much exactly a year ago. I enjoy her companion in general and like talking to her a lot. 

My main problem with her is that I don't understand her behaviour at all. We usually talk on the bus rides, on the way to school and when we gotta wait for the next lesson to start or stuff like this. One day, when we were walking from the school to the bus together, she pretty much randomly sped up and left me behind, she seemed pissed, even though I didnt really say anything. I still sat one row behind her, but since she didn't say bye when I got off the bus, I didn't either. From this point on, we didn't talk to each other for the next few months - I interpreted it as her being annoyed be me and I didn't want to bother her-. She still looked over to me from time to time, but recently, she just randomly started to talk to me again and I played along. Now we both got 6 weeks of vacation, and I am completely confused by her ignoring me from time to time and then being friendly to me again. (The ignoring for a while part happened at least 3 times in the last year).

So yeah, the point of this post is, for one, to get help with the third girl, because I can't figure, if she is now just trying to make it less awkward and is trying to be nice, and because I am afraid of asking out the ""wrong"" girl and regretting my decision. 

And honestly, I am not interested in a long distance relationship, but obviously can't expect somebody to move to an unknown city with me, so I pretty much would have to break up with the girl in question in a year, what really sucks :/ 

So, I guess I am looking for advice weither or not to ask out a girl, and just to go for one, or consider carefully. "
"Now that I'm losing weight, I no longer love my body like I used to.","My entire life I've been overweight. Now too overweight, but just barely in the unhealthy zone. I can remember being 5 years old and crying to my (crazy) mother about how kids called me fat in Kindergarten, and her response was, ""It just means you have a skinny back"".

Bullshit of my life story aside, I had to grow up fast, and stand up for myself. And when I did, I became confident in my abilities, in my intelligence, in my personality, in my beliefs/morals. Basically instead of working on losing the weight for other people, I worked on my self confidence. And it worked! I know I'm strong. I know I can hang with the guys, because my size is partially body fat partially muscle. 

But this summer, I started eating healthier out of moralish obligations. No soda, no fried food, more vegetables and fruits and less red meat. I also started going to my friend's bootcamp to support her. On top of it, I'm not participating in Ramadan, and the not eating, but continued work is making me drop inches. I wish I could tell you how many I've dropped, but I don't know the beginning number. I would say maybe 3 or 4 inches.

Here's the thing. Now that I'm smaller, I don't identify with the ""Big Momma"" trope that I had always aspired to be. The loveable, huggable, tactless maternal figure that you could depend on, and that no one messed with. When I looked in the mirror at my shrunken waist size I didn't feel great. I hadn't worked for anything to achieve that feeling. Instead I felt a little less powerful.

Sure being tinier would be great because of the health benefits but it doesn't feel like me. For 20 years, I've been that overweight loveable, huggable, tact-less girl that you can always depend on. I just don't know what to do with this new body."
"I don't talk or live with parents anymore, which I'm happy about, but now I feel especially lonely knowing I'm completely alone and unprepared for the world at 18.","The title says a little bit. I know I don't need anyone to be happy, but being alone without people caring on that level really does get sad sometimes. I live with a friend now who's family is awesome,  but I constantly feel distanced from them and burdening them even if they insist they like having me. My parents were abusive drug addicts who now try to contact me weekly to ask me to come back, but I know the environment was toxic, and the monetary support wouldn't make up for the emotional trauma that comes with living with them. Only recently has it bothered me after 3 months of being out of their house, and after being so happy, I'm now more often in a bad mood,  bringing others down. I don't really know if there's a way to fix this, it just brings makes me sad a lot of times I guess."
Am I fucking stupid? (Its a huge post),"I had the most absolutely amazing, mindblowing, passionate sex a few days ago. It was everything. Except it was with my cousin. And we were both drunk. We are sharing a room in another country right now, Other family next to us in a separate room.
 
I remember almost everything from that night. Seeing her facial expressions of awe and pleasure while i was inside her made me more happy than anything I've experienced. She is funny, drop dead gorgeous, has a great head on her sexy shoulders, and had an amazing personality. 

Many things are hurting me about this situation. For one, she doesnt even remember the night except for a few scattered parts. The three amazing hours arent in her memory. The pleasure I gave her is locked inside a corner of her unconscious somewhere. Another thing, we fucked again (this time sober) and I got too nervous and couldn't keep it up after about 10 mins. So I felt very inadequate, especially knowing thats the only sex she actually remembered. 

She has a boyfriend back home, and I knew that. I still cant help but be so emotional. I grew up with her, and i love her like family because thats what she is. But... at the same time... i cant help but feel.. something. I honestly dont know what it is. This feeling in my stomach, a good one. It tells me go over there and hug her, kiss her, cuddle her and comfort her. She is the only girl i have ever been comfortable enough with to do that. And she is my cousin. 

I know, and i tell myself this all the time for the last few days: you cant have a relationship with her. You just cant. You wont be able to have your own kids with her, things would be a lil odd with the family im sure. and plus she lives insanely far away. But i dont want a relationship, at the same time i want to be around her all the time. i want to hold her, i want her to hold me. I want to play with her hair after she comes out of the shower. I feel like an idiot.

She told me the other night, she found out she is pregnant. Now it's not my kid. Her and her boyfriend's kid. She is lost, dont know what to do, so i layed with her for awhile we talked. She told me our nights of sex were mistakes. That it shouldn't have happened. Although i somewhat agree, i cant help but take that personally too. At the same time, i feel guilty and stupid for even thinking that it was okay to have sex with my cousin. 

I think deep down inside me, I dont care much that she is my cousin. Things happen in life, and this is one of them. Should i feel so emotional about it? No. I shouldnt. I guess I assumed she would feel it was a mistake, i only dreaded it coming out. It hurts me inside. I dont know if im ever going to live long enough for an emotional and physical connection like the one i found this week. 

She told me during our drunken fuck, that she waited years for this. Asked me why i didnt go for it the last time we saw eachother. You should have seen her face while i was fucking her. It was the most wonderful sight. Mouth open, eyes rolling back in pure ecstasy. Will I ever find that again? Will I even be able to get over this ridiculous mess? And now she is pregnant and her boyfriend probably wont take care of the kid with her. Things just not going good. Almost drank myself to death the other night because of it. All i want is for her to be happy. I dont care if it kills me. 

Sorry for the huge wall of text. Thank you to whoever read this. I need to get it out before i do something stupid like jump of the balcony. Who knows."
I'm sick of myself and I can't cope with life at the moment,"Hey. I hate myself, but I'm mostly apathetic when it comes to work, my health and my life. I'm a lazyand cynical procrastinator who has a huge ego. It pisses me off that I can't finish anything, that I always give up and that I don't have any motivation. I tell myself everyday that I should try to improve, exercise, be productive and so forth, but me/my mind holds me back if I try to get started. I've tried to follow all the advices out there: ""Get out of your comfort zone, be kind to yourself, work hard, follow your dreams, try to help others"", but nothing seems to work.  I think I'm depressed or suffer from anxiety, but knowing that doesn't help me at all. I'm not suicidal, I just feel like a weak and useless parasite. Oh and yes, I'm planning on going to a therapist.  "
so my church kicked me out of a group for something that I did a while back...,I keep trying to tell them I'm ready for social interaction but they keep telling me that I'm not ready. I don't think that they realize that I don't get any actual face to face interaction because of my fear of rejection and it's turning me away from the church... I even had to drop a class last semester because of this my dad has sent sevral emals to the chruch describing the situtation but they still won't invite me back I don't know what to do any more.
"My SO can't stop comparing herself to other people, and it's destroying her.","Hello, reddit. My SO and I have been doing great. There's just one problem, though. She's a huge pessimist and self-loather. She compares herself to everyone else. She always feels inferior. Always. Worse? She compares herself to me. She always tells me that she wants to be like me, or like everyone else, and that she hates being herself.

She's an amazing person, reddit. You know, beautiful, intelligent, passionate, kind, all that jazz. She's all that. I love her for who she is, and I tell her that, but she just denies it. She loves me, too, of course, but it's getting worse and worse as she gets to know me more.

It's destroying her, and consuming her mind. It's like she's blind to all of the beauty inside of her. It's destroying her, and, consequently, our relationship. I don't know how to reassure her anymore. Thoughts?"
I wish I could rewind the past week and start over,"The whole past week has pretty much been nothing but one bad thing after another for me. Last wednesday I got pulled over for the first time ever for speeding and got a speeding ticket that is probably going to be expensive. Then on Thursday/Friday my boyfriend told me that while he has tried to make it work and form an emotional connection to me he just hasn't and doesn't see us being together in the long run and thought we would be better off not as a couple. i'm pretty crushed about it because even though we have only been together 2-3 months I have never felt this way about any past boyfriends and he had even said I could move in and I had been spending most of my free time and nights at his house and I really thought he could be someone I could spend the rest of my life with so I've spend the last 3-4 days crying off and on and being a drunken mess or sleeping when i didn't have work. 

On top of that I have a UTI and I'm PMSing so that isn't helping my emotional state and the last 3 days at work I've had either shifts that started at 4am or shifts where I had to do a lot of moving/lifting heavy boxes and I started my summer college class last night so I'm physically and mentally/emotionally exhausted and just want to start the whole week over again.

My unemployed brother is destroying my mother's life.,"So my 63 year old mother just got out of the hospital. She recently had to have surgery to remove 6 inches of colon due to a blockage. As if this didn't make her life hard enough, she comes home to find out that her son has taken all the money out of her bank account and then some. She is currently overdrawn, thanks to him. She's already poor and trying to live off of Social Security. But now she has less than no money.

My problem is that I live in another state. I feel like I should try to help her in some way but I'm not sure how. My brother has been leeching money from her since my dad passed away in 2012. He's stolen every piece of jewelry or anything of value that she owns. This includes my dead father's wedding ring. I just don't know how to help her if she won't help herself. She won't send him away. She says she needs him to run errands for her because she's usually too sick to do it on her own. (She has chronic intestinal issues.) However, this means she's putting her debit card into his greedy little hands. Not only is she pretty much setting herself up for theft but she's bailed him out of jail twice.

Would I be able to help her if I lived nearby? I wouldn't mind running errands for her or helping out around the house. Would moving back mean letting him ruin my own life? I'm not afraid to stand up to him. At the moment, I live with my long-term boyfriend who hates my brother's guts and is convinced he'll move on to trying to get money from us if we were to move back.  I feel helpless. I'm just at a loss of what to do. I feel like I owe my mom whatever protection and help I can offer. Yet, should I sacrifice my own happiness for her?"
Anxiety about the general passage of time. [PM me!],"I've been becoming more aware of time passing. I think about my father getting older, and the idea if eventually losing him is overwhelming.  the concept of time running out is always on my mind. I suppose a fear of death is part of it, but it's more an anxiety of not having spent my time correctly. Not accomplishing enough, not having learned enough or done something worth while enough when the sand runs out.  I guess most people just ignore these types of thoughts and try not to focus on them, but I feel like it's something I should overcome instead of bury. I really just don't know what to do with those basic truths about life. I'd be grateful for any advice on how to approach those concepts. Thank you. "

My job offer got rescinded.,"Well it's that time of year again, when university students scramble to find a good job for the summer, both for some extra income as well as experience. In late February, I interviewed for a position that I was interested in and got the job shortly after. I was told that I would get an information, etc package emailed to me in a couple of weeks.

Then last week I got a call from HR telling me that my job offer is no longer valid. Either they didn't give a reason or it was because they ""accidentally hired too many people"", I can't really remember because I was too shocked. They offered me another interview as a consolation, but I don't know my chances this time around. Meanwhile the rest of my friends are all accepting their offers (I'm happy for them, because I know how it feels). Now I'm back to constant worrying about what I'm going to do for the entire summer if nobody wants me."
SO starting meds,"My SO is starting antidepressants today and I don't really know how to feel about it. I know that it might help them and I support them on whatever helps their depression but I'm scared that it will drastically change their personality. I'm scared they might get addicted or misuse them or even overdose. They told me about it and they're starting on a low dosage and we won't see reactions for a few weeks. If anybody has experienced similar situations, I'd greatly appreciate any advice on coping and adapting to this."
Nothing I want more than just to start over.,"Like ALL over. My disposition has done an absolute 180 degree turn and I really just wish I could do it over again. Basically all I see my future consisting of is me doing something I don't give a shit about and paying off student loans because I fucked around in high school. Not only am I dreading the future but I don't really have anything to hold on to. I still haven't found my ""calling"" or reason to keep pushing. I see all my peers have their passions, but I've always just coasted though everything. My parents seem pretty dead set on me just going to college and getting a normal job. Fuck that. I have daily thoughts of just leaving everything behind and going out and trying to do everything on my own. My parents have never wronged me though and pretty much given me everything I needed to be ""successful"". I'm not about to walk out on that. This might seem normal/petty but it's just kind off concerning to me that I have daily thoughts dreading the future and just wanting to start over/walk out."
Just can't make myself care..,"I'm sitting here at work.. Once again. Just like every weekday from 8am to 5pm and I simply cannot make myself give half a shit about anything I'm supposed to be doing.

It's not difficult, it's not a lot of work. It's just pointless. I don't give a flying rat's ass if this or that email is up to date in these accounts. Why make us do this manually when a programmer could write something to get it done and keep it up to date continually? This whole department is a half baked pile of shit and I'm definitely over it.

This is probably the umpteenth time I've posted here about my job, I know. But it is always what's bothering me. I may be able to lift myself out of my depression on the weekends but this job just pulls me right back down.

Also, why the fuck does it have to cost so much money just to exist in society? Ridiculous."
"Bad in school, gaming addicted and a crush on a girl.","Hi!

I'm just really down. In school we have now halftime of the year, and we get something like a school report. And, how should it else be, i'm negative in one subject. You will think now:""Wow, no big problem, you can learn next test or something"", but it isn't that easy. I'm quite addicted to playing computer games. I just can't learn. Even though i really want to, i just can't memorize those facts. In my report i got 1 A (programming), and the rest are all D's, and the one F. (Not quite sure if this is right, in Austria we got from 1-5, where 1 is the best. So i got 1x 1, about 10x 4 and 1x5).You got any tips for me how to learn? Just for example the one F/5 is about different spectroscopies, like Infrared, High-performance liquid chromatography and so on. That's really hard stuff in my opinion, i just can't learn it, i somehow don't want to understand it. And i don't want to stop the school, because one day i want to become a programmer, and that for i almost need to finish that school, there is no school like this in the next 150km.

And yeah, then there is this hot girl in my class i have a crush on since like a year. She sits almost in front of me, and somehow i just can't concentrate, i have to think of her, look at her how beautiful she is and so on. Since like 3-4 month's i can't sleep good at night, because i often dream of her. Sometimes i really want to cry, but i can't. It is really hard for me. And since i told her how i like her and so on, and she said she doesn't like me this way, just as a friend, everything is much harder. Have you got any tips for me here too?

BTW: I'm 17.

**tl;dr:** I'm bad in school mostly because i'm addicted to computer games. Need some tips how to learn properly. 
Girl i have a crush on for over a year doesn't like me back and i can't sleep properly, and in school i have to think of her about all the time.

"I'm 21, never been in a relationship, or had sex.","I have a feeling this is going to be a long rant. How I met your mother inspired me to write this. Its a good tv-show, would recommend. However, here is my story:

I'm 21 now. Played a sport (which I will not mention, for privacy reasons) for 14 years. Got to university to study sport science and exercise, life is good. I just haven't had any relationship.


While were at this, lets look back into my teens. As a teen I had acne problem. Really bad one too. Like, really really bad and long one. Tried pretty much everything (except the prescription ones, which was a mistake, should have tried earlier), but I got rid of it just now. At the age of 20. It did its damage to my self confidence, I mean... how could someone like somebody who had acne all over his face. Also, I got glasses, that gave a huge punch to my self confidence also. I'm still not quite in terms with my glasses. They're big and thick and...well I prefer contact lenses. Never liked my hair either. I would never do anything to my hair. The haircuts I get are ""short, but to short enough for the army. The regular kind of haircut"" I don't do anything with my hair, I just don't like it. I've been playing around with the idea of going to a stylist and telling her to do whatever she wants, full artistic freedom. As long as it looks good. My clothing? I don't know, regular. I suppose. Some brand clothes from some sport store. Whatever.

Now that we got my looks out of the way, I guess its good to mention my social life. I recall having 4 really close friends, but all of the classmates were good buddies, there is no bad blood between us. I played a lot of video games with the closest friends. That was it, video games. While I was at it, I kept on with my sport and had quite good friends from there also. They were nice. 

At some point however, these buddies started hanging out. Alcohol came into the scene, I wasn't really too into alcohol (to this day I still am not), neither did I know how just go out. I didn't want to go out. I found it more comforting to be inside, playing some stupid ass video game with friends, or practicing the sport I loved. 

Speaking of the sport, I was so good at it that I made it to the national team and the world cup. First year, under 18. Was fantastic, everything was fantastic, silver medal, best player award, things were good. I tried out on a team and didn't make it. It was huge bump for me. I couldn't sleep. Next year comes and I make to the team national team again. The media never was too nice on my sport. They like to pick out the bad things and run with them to get the clicks. One day you win and the next day you have the shittiest game of your life. Guess which one makes the news. And which one will get some nice comments such as: Personal_Issues is the weak link in the team, why is he getting playtime? Random people calling the general manager of the team, only to ask why I was playing instead of someone else. I felt like I was in a middle of a controversy. I couldn't stop reading the comments. My teammates told me not to care about them, but I couldn't. I was so curious. I remember the second tournament and the first game. We lost and they wanted to get an interview into news and the first question was: ""You performed poorly, did you even prepare for the tournament?"" Well, fuck you too. In the end, the 3rd place was one goal away. One goal. I'm the goalkeeper, I could have stopped that goal, but no. The third world cup was a major fuckup. When I was asked for 4th time for tryouts I just opted out with some shitty excuse. I wanted to have nothing to do with it. Eventually I just stopped playing completely. I never had a very good self confidence. I don't really believe the goddamn world cups never did too well on my self confidence. I even hate to bring the fact that I ever played there up. I think it became a vicious spiral, I had no self confidence, so I performed poorly. Because I performed poorly my self confidence always found a new low point. Never again, will I be that fuckup in front of anyones eyes. I guess that sort of made me very self conscious. I always try to please everyone and try not to fuck up at anything.

So, what does someone with no self confidence, and not willing to go out do these days? Play video games. I play them, not alot. I have a social circle. I would go online, talk with buddies via skype and play. I play more than I care to admit. That's my social circle. Three to four buddies whom I talk in skype with and some dudes who I met through the video game. I never met them in real life. 

Now i'm watching how I met your mother. Even though is a lighthearted comedy it makes me feel like a failure. I don't want to be this guy who goes to university, gets back home, plays video games until 2 am and wakes up sleep deprived (again). I want to go out. I want to drink with my buddies and have fun talking. I'm not very good at it, but I suppose I could just sit there listening. And be comfortable with it. For some reason i'm not comfortable with it. I'm not comfortable in that kind of setting. I would love to be. I know that once I was, but for some reason no more I am. 

The title of this post is what it is. And its wearing me out. I'm watching how I met your mother and I find myself thinking: How does one find someone like Robin. They're out there. I know, I've seen them. Really, really fine looking ladies. And they are funny, charming, cute, beautiful, everything. But how does one proceed from that? I don't hunt them. I just.... I just assume something happens at some point and stars align and... something. And every single tip and trick and suggestion and whatnot always highlights: Be self confident. Well, I guess before I am not happy with myself I can't expect someone to like me, an emotional mess of insecurities and neediness to show that I am capable and absolutely, totally not offending anyone by anything. And the sex part. I've played with the idea of going into a club, doing a one night stand and just be done with it. I realized that, that isn't what I want. Even though it isn't what I wan't I can't say it is not wearing me out. Everyone else seems to have done it. Everyone seems to know everything about it. I don't know. The sex part is hard to explain. I don't want to just simply have sex, but the fact that I haven't had sex is still kinda bugging me.

Also, the poor soul who read through this. I feel sorry for you. This wasn't supposed to be this long, but well, seems like there is many thins boiling under my skin.

A 'compliment' today made me feel really self-conscious and shitty,"A guy randomly came up to me and gave me a strange compliment today - ""You have excellent posture"", then just walked away. And he's right, I do.

Whether he was being facetious or genuine doesn't matter to me - either way, it made me feel really self-conscious. I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a side effect of which is a curved spine. I've learnt to have this perfect posture to stop me being in chronic pain. To be made so self aware of your own illness, regardless as to whether that was his intention, makes me feel like shit. 

That's all"

Ive developed a crush on a girl I only talked to for an hour or so at a party. Getting her number would be weird but i want to so badly,"I went to a friends party and hung out with a few girls in the front room for a bit. her and i got to talking, were both in the same grade, shes beautiful, shes down to earth and just fun. we put on the lone rider and watched it a bit, she was somewhat drunk and i was on lsd which kinda obscured my judgement. anyway, after a bit she and her friends had to go home, i didnt get a goodbye or a number or anything. we have a mutual friend( the host) and im considering if i should ask him to ask her if shed like to text me or if thatd be weird. i feel absolutely infatuated, she is completely my type. we got along pretty well but it didnt get too deep, just a pleasant conversatiom and im not that attractive so thats what worries me."
The show-off guy who uses the leg curl machine for his feet during pushups.,"My gym is organized into four sections. There is a cardio machine area, weight machines area, free weights area and mat area. 
Yesterday was probably the fifth time I see this guy at the gym, who goes to the weight machine area, puts his feet on the seat of the leg curl machine and starts doing pushups with his hands on the ground (legs elevated on the seat). There are various benches in the free weight area that could be adjusted to the same height as the curl seat.
He doesn't need to do it right in the middle of the weight machine area. It is rude. Oh, and each time he does the gym is semi-busy but never so busy that he can't do this in the weight area or the mat area.

Showing off is the purpose I guess but it just makes me so mad. That, and his dirty shoes always leave marks on the leg curl machine seat and the person who uses the machine for its intended purpose has to clean it off :("

I tried to kiss my best friend.,"My on-again-off-again ex-girlfriend just broke up with me again (it's over for good now) after essentially 9 months (which in itself is a whole other story). During my relationship with her, I spent lots of time with this best friend in question and began to get very close with her. When my ex broke up with me, this best friend was there to comfort me. After a hike recently, I went in for a kiss, as I thought there were some feelings we shared. I feel like she had led me on, as we danced at a school dance (during a period where my ex and I weren't together). We had hung out alone together in the past and went on hikes and nature adventures frequently, even when my ex and I were still together, but we never made any sort of romantic physical contact. She told me that she understood where I was coming from, but told me that she couldn't. We vowed to not talk about it again, and she said that she only saw us as staying good friends. Even a few of my friends thought she had some interest in me. Basically, right now I'm upset at myself for nearly ruining one of the best friendships I've ever had. Part of me however believes that there was good reason for me to believe that she had romantic interest in me. I'm so confused and upset at myself. Ask me any questions you have. I might post my entire story to /r/relationships, as there are tons more to my story that I need help with. "
There is a guy I really like that has a daughter... I don't know how I feel about it yet.,"I met this wonderful guy weeks ago, we instantly clicked. It is very rare for me to have chemistry in all subjects with someone, he makes me laugh & I make him laugh. He looks for me which is great! I usually do the man-hunting and I really like that about him, I feel that he likes me just as much as I like him. But he has a daughter, she is about 4 years old. I don't really know how I feel about it just yet, and I can't control the feeling of ""oh"" I get every time he mentions ""I have to drop off my daughter at my Baby Mama's house"". I've noticed there is also that small awkward silence that seems like an eternity right after it's mentioned also. I tried having a conversation with him about it, like asking him what she's like and he'll tell me stories, but I feel like I have to force my self to be interested in that topic. I know the little girl isn't at fault, it's just me. "

I don't want to go to the GP because I'm afraid of their response,"I get sudden periods of depression lasting 3-7 hours, feelings of being alone when surrounded by people, the feeling of bringing shame to family because of not being 'good enough' or under achieving expectations. Nearly everyday I get a sudden loss of energy and motivation so obvious that my family and a few friends are questioning me about it. Then to top it off I get feelings of sudden aggression and feelings of wanting to self harm. 
I also drink a lot more than I should, just because when I'm drunk the voices in my head stop and I can sleep.

I have told one of my friends how I have been feeling and she told me to go seek help and I want to, but I'm afraid of what they will tell me. I also feel like my family will be ashamed of me for not just asking them for help before seeing a doctor about it."

"Facebook makes me feel lonely, but leaving it would only make me lonelier.","Social media has been getting me really down.  

First off, I should say that I'm naturally a social guy.  Despite some social anxieties I've struggled with over the years, I've never really had a problem getting to know people or ""putting myself out there,"" so to speak.  

Now, I have a lot of friends on Facebook and a lot of them ""like"" and comment on the statuses and content I post (lately, I've been averaging something like 30-40 ""likes"" per status / picture / whatever else have you).  Sometimes in person, they tell me how funny or thought-provoking my posts are.  And yeah, that's great I guess.  It's like I'm ""high-school popular"" or something.  

But lately, I've been feeling lonely about it all. It's like my social life is being boiled down to how many people like or comment on the things I put out on the internet, and I feel like my friends aren't really listening or even care that much at all.  It makes me feel like a bit of a toy.  On top of that, it seems I have to keep producing these posts in order to have my feelings noticed and stay relevant.  And that makes me feel exhausted and, more troublingly, empty.  

So,  I've thought about breaking from social media entirely, if only to become more in touch with myself, my family, and the people who are dear to me.  The problem is that I've done this before-- I left Facebook for a 9- month stretch during a post-breakup depression-- and it's never quite fared well in my favor: since all of my friends are on Facebook, all of them--even the close friends--primarily communicate, plan events, etc. through Facebook so naturally, I missed out on a lot of real-life social happenings.  

**tl;dr I feel caught in this Catch-22:  either I stay obsessively stuck to Facebook to be noticed but feel empty about it, or break with it entirely but feel lonely about it.**  

So, that's me.  That's what's on my mind.  "

Edit: I should have mentioned I am 22 years old and male"
"I'm depressed, but have no one to talk to.","I'm 19 years old and I've been pretty depressed for the last few years. It's led to me being pretty socially awkward, and I finally told a family friend and asked for some help. They suggested I talk to a psychiatrist to see about therapy or medication, so I did that and I was diagnosed with Major Clinical Depression and Social Anxiety and prescribed some medicine. I've been to several therapy sessions and I'm two weeks into my medication.

The medication hasn't taken effect yet, and the therapy is slow-going, but ever since I started it, it's sort of 'opened the floodgates.' It's made me want to talk about what's going on in my head more, but I feel like I can't talk to anybody besides my therapist. I'm glad I can talk to her, but I want to talk to someone I have a more personal relationship with, and I feel like it would help more in the long run. I also wouldn't have to wait a week or two to talk every time I wanted to talk to someone for an hour.

The family friend that recommended getting help says I can talk to her, as she's a sort of motherly figure to me, but I can't bring myself to do it. I feel like it would make this a very one-sided relationship. She has her own family and her own stressful things to deal with, so talking to me about all the depressing thoughts that are overflowing in my mind would just bring her down, especially because she wouldn't be able to actually help with anything other than by listening.

I'd probably write more, but my thoughts are kind of cluttered right now. I don't really expect much help for this. I just wanted to get it off my chest. I've got about a week before my next therapy session, so hopefully this will make things a little easier. Thanks."
"Back in College, but Falling into Old Habits","I'm back in college after a five year break from completing high school. I've got a few assignments due, and am constantly getting sick due to stress. 

Physics and Chemistry are freaking me out, as some of the material, I do not fully understand but am too afraid to ask for help with it. I'm a very nervous individual and so I do not like to speak up often or look like I do not know something, for fear of what others will say or do to me. 

I know my fear of learning and asking questions likely comes from when I was younger, and my mother would yell and scream at me for hours when I tried to do my homework (if I messed up the answer to a question). That makes it hard to actually focus on my work to this day.

I have no idea how to overcome my nervous disposition, or my zoning out when actually trying to learn that's from previous abuse/bad experiences related to learning. 

I want to learn, I want to ask and I want to do well, but I don't know how."
I don't know how to end things with my boyfriend.,"I should say he's my ex-boyfriend since I left him 3 days ago. We dated for 2 and half years, but I can't be with him anymore because I've always had to carry this big weight on my shoulders with him. It's made me bitter and always frustrated. I couldn't talk to him about anything at all. If he checked out another girl in front of me, I couldn't say anything. If I did, he would turn to anger and tell me the entire argument is my fault because I brought it up in the first place. Last year, I tried leaving him. 

He gave me false promises and hope about him stopping to be that way. It only lasted for a month and the past year I've struggled with trying to make things work with him. It seemed like I was the only one trying and the only one making an effort to make anything better. It takes 2 people to make a relationship work.

 I'm afraid to say anything and always held everything in because of him. This isn't a way a relationship should be.. at least a healthy one. I'm tired of it all. I'm seeing myself turn into this ill tempered bitch and it's because of him. When I finally dumped him, he won't leave me alone. He came to my house and wouldn't leave and kept calling me to come outside. When I finally did he wouldn't stop trying to hug me and kiss me and crying. So much crying, but what about those times I would cry and beg for him to forgive me for saying anything? He would always look at me and keep smoking his cigarette, and wouldn't say anything to me. I felt like dirt under his shoe for the past 2 years. 

It's just a bad situation I needed to get out of.. Now he won't stop messaging me and calling me. It's like no matter what I do he keeps bothering me. He wants me to come back to him and to give him time to show me that he'll be different. I don't want to though. I keep telling him, but he doesn't get the picture. He talks about suicide and I know it's post break up things, but he talked about it before. And normal people wasn't in war and saw the stuff he saw and had to do what he did.. It worries me at the same time. I don't know how to end things with him... It's stressing me out so much.. "

Being a pizza face sucks..,"If you don't know what a pizza face is first off, its a person who is covered in acne on their face. I am one of those people. Now don't go telling me what products I should try because I've pretty much tried them all. I'm on a prescription based one, no its not accutane it's a different one, but it's suppose to have the same effects. Anyways let me tell you about today. 

I'm a grade 11 high schooler. I guess I would call myself an introvert. I don't hang out with a lot of people, just my boyfriend (who has perfect skin..) and his friends. I am a girl who only hangs out with guys. Why? Because I hate girls. They cause too much drama and commotion. I get called a slut a lot because I hang out with guys. That doesn't affect me all that much. What really bothers me is when people need to pick out my flaws. 

I was siting on the bus today, for the first time in two weeks because I always have cross country after school the coach gave us the day off or else I wouldn't have been on the bus, I'm just minding my own business listening to radio off my new iPod. I only had one ear bud in because sometimes people will talk to me and I think it's rude if you have both in. Anyways I hear this guy in grade ten who sits across from me, say to some little kids probably in grade 2-4, ""You see that girl? You never want to grow up to be like her. She's what you call a harry pizza face."" All of them started laughing.. I looked up at them and one of the little kids said, ""Oh snap!! She heard us!!"" I know theres the saying ""sticks and stones can't break your bones but words will never hurt me"" but those words hurt.. I can't do anything about my situation.. I take my medicine, I wash my face, I drink water, I exersize.. but none of it seems to help. My mother thinks it's from pressure I get at school. I always have homework (I'm suppose to be doing a write up right now about how humans could live on mars), I'm always pushed to do more than I can handle, I'm being pushed to learn a new language (I'm trying to learn German, I'd argue that it is harder than math in my case), I'm just always stressed out and over tired. 

My mother thinks I should go talk to the principal about that kid on my bus since he goes to my school, but what's the point? What will be done? Nothing. I know that's how my school works. We have a cop at our school and she allows 15 and 16 year olds to smoke when the law clearly is that you have to be 18!! I've heard that high school is suppose to be the easiest years of your life, but I just can't believe that at this moment.

Class started 3 weeks ago and I haven't went yet,"I know I'm not too far behind to catch up, but I will be in a day or two. This depression is killing me. I started going to a counselor and a psychiatrist, and got prescribed stuff to help, but it isn't going to fix all the classes I withdrew from and all the bridges I burned. 

To top it off, I'm rushing a sorority, and during our personal interviews today, I saw the lady writing a note on her paper that said: 'lip issue'. She was referring to my almost completely healed cold sore that I've spent an awful week trying to get over. People tell me that ""No one pays attention to cold sores."" When you combine that with the reason someone broke up with me recently, my once high self esteem is in shambles. Getting broken up with for being ""not phsycially attractive"" is absolutely terrible. It still effects me and I'm doing everything I can to get over it.

Maybe it's a little petty and maybe I should just get over it, but it kinda bothers me that several guys have been using me as a middle-person. 

I suppose it makes me feel pretty insignificant. Especially one of these friends, was a good friend of mine in the first place, and then I introduced him and my roommate. Maybe I'm jealous, and I suppose that means I'm a bit insecure, doesn't it? I know I should chill and let things be as they are, but I can't help feel like I'm turning into the second-hand friend. "

Girls that date down confuse and infuriate me.,"Preface: I'm a five, six on a good day. I'm just on that side of being a short guy (5' 6""), but of an acceptable weight, no deformities. I'm alright, not great. I'm affable, generous, respectful, and all that other stuff, yet I've been shot down for being short (And informed so) on SEVERAL occasions without anybody ever getting to know me.

So when I see a really really attractive girl who's dating, say, a giant balding fat guy with greasy hair and skin and a neckbeard, it really bothers me. It's like, how did that happen? What happened that this friggin guy pulled that off and I can't find ANYBODY?

Cannot find work that satisfies me. Getting depressed.,"I am highly intelligent (read: Mensa). I have a university degree in humanities. I get bored very easily.

I cannot find work that satisfies me.

I am now bored to the degree that I am getting depressed by my work. I hate my job, and I dread every day when I have to leave for work. My work quality is bad, and I fear the day it will be discovered.

I know I have to quit, but I have no other line of work I can apply for. I've been searching for jobs for several months, but I rarely find anything that is even mildly interesting. Getting another boring job will just lead to the same thing (I have tried).

The thing is I cannot find work that is challenging. Most jobs consists of menial tasks with no thinking required.

I know this might come off as arrogant, but I hope someone will understand the feeling of throwing one's life away. I know I have great potential, but I cannot find a way to express it. Besides work I have a family, so using my spare time to follow my passions is not going to work.

I am not happy if I am not challenged, and I cannot find any jobs that challenges me in the right way. I am loosing hope in ever finding a job that will give me some kind of satisfaction. I should probably have become a scientist or researcher, but that is too late now. Being a father in my 30's means I cannot afford to go back to study.

Being unhappy also makes me a bad parent and SO, and knowing that just makes me more unhappy. I am in a bad downward spiral and I don't know how to exit. I am probably not clinically depressed yet, but I am getting there..."
My whole life right now is a mistake.,"In February, I started the application process for a fairly elite grassroots organization. I did this mostly because I was bored one day, they were sending me thousands of e-mails, and I was scheduled to graduate a year early that upcoming May. I did not think I would wind up accepted into the program, much less stationed fifteen hundred miles away from home. 

I knew after the first week of our intensive, month-long training program that this organization was not for me. I did not, and do not, have the passion, energy, and excitement for its cause that so many of its members have. Rather, I found myself caught up in a whirlwind that I could not escape. I let myself succumb to the pressures of my family and friends, all of whom were so proud of me for being accepted into an organization with an 8% acceptance rate. I was met with constant reminders that the obligation was temporary - two years - and that it would be a wonderful growing experience for me. Living in a far away city would help me mature and develop as a person.

They're right, of course. I know that living far away and working an unimaginably difficult job will force me to grow up in ways I still cannot imagine. And I have tried to make a life for myself in New Orleans. I have tried to get up and go to work every day and *not* hate my life, but the fact remains that I *do*. And I cannot help but be completely disgusted with myself for staying with this when I knew that it wasn't the right move for me. 

I want to go home. I'm homesick, of course, but it's more than that. I can't imagine living the next two years doing this job. I don't want to. I don't have a passion for it. It drains me, completely and totally. I wake up every day and absolutely *hate* where I'm going; I fall asleep and I'm so goddamn *sad* that I have to wake up the next morning. I'm lonely, frustrated, and extremely angry. And, to be honest, that's not fair to the people I'm supposed to be helping. It isn't even fair to me. 

Of course, to compound that, I'm falling in love with someone who I absolutely cannot love. In no way, shape, or form would it work. And that just isn't fair. "
I'm keeping damn near everything I care about a secret from my family.,"So. I've spent the last eight years living with my mother and grandmother. Mom's overbearing and has been chasing rainbows for decades, and my grandmother's forgotten what it's like to chase anything and thinks it's weird if Mom and I do. Growing up with them, I came to hide most of the things that I cared about. I was just...very studious. Good little girl getting fabulous grades and never causing any trouble...or having a social life...or going out...or making any long-term plans. I always felt they were watching for any sign of emotion or any deviation from the norm, analyzing, even telling everyone about it (seriously, my grandmother calls everyone if we do anything at all).

Except that it's gotten to me more and more lately. Truth is, my secrecy taints my perception of the things I love. I'm a pretty satisfied, gay sociology major with a wonderful friend who I love to bits. But...let's take that last part. I know that there's nothing wrong with my relationship with her, but because I've hidden it from my family, I start to believe that I'm doing something wrong (because after all, why else would I hide it?), and I can't be myself even when I know my intrusive family is miles away. The same, to some degree, goes for my major--no, don't smile at the interesting journal article, because then *they'll notice*--and almost anything else that moves me. 

It's ridiculous. I've been struggling with this for years, the knowledge (or at least well-supported suspicion) that they're watching everything I do. I've gotten by being the single-minded scholar with the carefully hidden passions, but I shouldn't have to do that. I've considered pulling Mom aside for a chat in the near future, just to get the most important secrets out, so that I can live them without all that stress. I may still do it. It'll probably be difficult and awkward, but since their gaze follows me everywhere now, and I have more and more wonderful things in my life that I'd like not to have to conceal, it just might have to happen anyway."
Not sure how to deal with depression,"I think I've had problems with depression and social anxiety for much longer than I knew and would want to admit. In May, I mentioned it to my mom and now she uses it against me in arguments. It only makes my problem worse.
I really noticed the problem my senior year of high school and now I'm going into my sophomore year of college and it's only gotten worse. I joined a sorority last year and it helped a lot, but I had to go financially inactive this semester. So not only am I not able to go to events, but my roommates (who are also in my sorority) are always gone and doing things with the sorority. Now I feel twice as alone as before. I turn to alcohol to make me feel better sometimes, and I've had ""dark"" thoughts. I'm scared of me sometimes.
I've mentioned depression to two of the people closest to me and I don't think they understand that I really am having a hard time. I guess my trying to hide that I'm having any kind of trouble is working. I want to seek help because it's getting really bad lately, but I don't know if anyone will take me seriously. 
How have you guys dealt with depression? 

Edit: Thank you all so much for your support. It has made me start feeling better already. I'm glad that people like y'all are out there. Never stop being awesome!"
I think my mom hates me.,"We've never gotten along, but I'm the middle daughter of an otherwise all-male family. We never have had a close relationship, but I had felt like I could talk to her. 

Some back-story; both her and my dad have extensive educations. It has been ground into us that education is the only thing that will prevent us from having miserable lives. (Their words, not mine.)

I flunked out of college this year. I moved back home, and have been without a plan all summer. Every day she would drop hints about me failing at one thing or another, or getting career brochures. I'm signed up for classes at my community college, but that isn't enough for her.

Over the family vacation we didn't have enough room for all of us in the camper, so I slept in the car. I lived out of an adidas bag that I kept in the camper. She went through my clothes and decided which ones I was allowed to keep for the trip. She left mainly summer clothes, and we were heading up to Maine and Canada. She sent them home through the post office when we hit Boston, while I was asleep. 

Today, she started yelling at me because she thinks I'm useless. All because I asked her to warn me when she was vacuuming behind me. She never asked for help, or I would have. Instead, she goes on a rant about how I am a useless lazy piece of shit who has zero respect for her. I left the room because I was so shocked. A couple hours later I decided I wanted to take my dog to the dog park and I couldn't find my keys. I looked for them for half an hour before I went and asked her. She hid them in our mixing bowls in their liquor cabinet. My wallet and the keys to the car I paid for myself. She had no right. 

She also told me I was getting fat in front of my friends. 

I just don't get why she doesn't love me, or what I did to be the one she picks on."
I'm holding on to hope,"Recently out of a relationship that, to me, was magic.  I was older, she's in grad school, it was an LDR.  We were engaged.  She broke it off because she was confused and conflicted.  Didn't want to be a step mom or really a wife.  Wanted to live a little first.

Had she said, ""I don't love you any more"" or ""I'm seeing someone else"" I'd have been devastated, and I'd have moved on.

But, she said, ""I don't know what the future holds.""  And ""I just need to be on my own for a while.""  And ""In a few years, who knows?""

Now, I know, as a grown person with a lot of relationships under my belt, that these are all nice ways of saying she doesn't want to be with me any more, and she wants to be with someone else.  My problem is, I can't let go of the hope.

This isn't a matter of forgetting her, or not loving her any more.  And I haven't talked to her in weeks.  But I've had worse relationships before and I've had a hard time letting go.  She was the best thing that's ever happened to me, I celebrated that every day, openly told her, shouted from rooftops.  I'd planned to quit my job, leave my kids with their mom (joint custody) and move to be with her.  I'd have given up everything.

So now I'm insanely holding onto the hope of maybe.  I'm holding onto ""who knows?""  I'm 40 now, how long do I wait?  How long can I wait?  To me it's worth waiting, but I don't know if I'll be able to.  I can fill the time while I'm waiting, but when do I stop?

Knowing how relationships end, and what you're supposed to do is one thing.  But how do you deal with removing that hope?  Has anyone else ever hoped and waited and won out?  My head is tearing itself apart trying to decide."
My grandma is losing her memory.,"My grandma, who's been one of my best friends throughout my life (I'm 20 now) is talking more and more about how her memory has been going.  She's started keeping a journal with people's names and dates of importance (my parents wedding days and birthdays, mine and my brother's birthdays, etc) and it's been getting to me a little bit.  My great grandmother passed away about five years ago.  She had dementia and my disowned great aunt Peggie essentially tricked her into writing that everything went to Peggie in the will.  Not that anything like that is going to happen in my family, but I'm remembering that and thinking about how sad the whole thing was.

When I say she's my best friend, what I mean is that since I was a really little kid she's done a lot for me.  She and my granddad used to live in Virginia, and I have so many incredible memories there.  They used to take me to Colonial Williamsburg as a little kid, and to this day the memories are inseparable.  We're also the same myers-briggs type, so we're very similar people

I don't know how to deal with it.  I don't want to talk to her about it quite yet, but has anyone been through the same thing?

EDIT:  Thanks everyone, I really appreciate it.  Your input means a lot, I'll definitely try some of the things you suggested.  I generally feel a bit better about it."
"Wasting money on buying clothes that I like, but then society/my mother/myself makes me embarrassed to wear it.","Sorry this may be long.
This has been an on-going problem for me.  Ever since I started to develop and mature into a woman, I outgrew my ""Junk Foods"" T-shirts and tried to find trends that I liked/were somewhat popular in the times.  However, I've grown to dislike certain aspects of clothing, such as: sheer clothing (I don't like to layer, though I've forced myself to for years), things that show imprints of what you're wearing underneath (tight pants show underwear lines, and my mom won't let me get thongs, or bra lines that show against shirts), long sleeves (I end up rolling them to my elbows), too tight/too loose shirts, lots of cleavage, shorts that are too short, really skinny and really flare jeans, etc.  I don't know why these bother me so much, but it really limits what I buy.  

But I could live with my stunted clothing choices if my mother didn't come into play.  I love my mom, and I value her opinion in my life.  Since I still live with her, and have not gone into college yet, she has a lot of say when it comes to clothing.  And it's not the typical, ""don't wear that demeaning clothing"" because I don't like the new daring trends.  She pushes me to wear ""pretty"" or ""sophisticated, trendy"" clothes of today.  And it's weird because I look at the clothes and think ""I might actually look good in/like these"" but then I get uncomfortable.  I don't know why, but I think it might be due to my mom's past criticisms of my clothes or the fact that I've dressed basically one way for my entire life, and if I changed people would notice.  I would often wear a t-shirt and jeans for school, but right on the way out of the door she would look at me in disgust and say ""you're going to wear that? wear something nicer."" So that puts me off when it comes to the clothes I like.

When it comes to the clothes she likes, I think that if I wear them, people at school and people I know would comment with something like ""I've never seen you wear clothes like that, etc"" These could be things like skirts, nice blouses, or layered cardigans.  I think I would enjoy them, until I realize people would take notice, which somehow makes me feel uncomfortable wearing them.  Also, if I do wear them, I get uncomfortable in public, and begin to take off layers and change pieces throughout the day until I'm basically at a bare minimum when it comes to jewelry, layered clothing, uncomfortable shoes, makeup (which I never wear btw) and etc.

Sorry this has been long.  Basically, I spend too much money on buying clothes I like, my mom likes, and new adventurous pieces that I end up not wearing because I realize I dislike the fashion, my mom puts me down for wearing such things, or that society would take notice.  I don't know what to do, and this is especially killing me since school is coming up.  I hate wasting money, and I wish I could wear things without being uncomfortable for so many reasons."

bored with life,"im just bored with life and kinda want it to be over. my only friend is moving, and no one else talks to me. im getting bored with everything i do and just feel as if my life as peaked, and im done now, i wanna leave. im not really depressed to where im going to hurt myself, but if i was to die tomorrow; i think id be ok with that. i dont know. just in the back of my mind lately ive found myself thinking a lot about death and dying."
I need more perspectives,"I’m 22. Over the past few years I’ve started to notice a lot of interesting things about myself. I’m mentally exhausted and wouldn’t even know how to explain things if I weren’t, but to put it shortly I exhibit each and every one of the signs/symptoms of childhood sexual abuse. Literally every single one of them. 

Since i was like 12 i have been sexually adventurous and advanced but cannot perform unless I *subconsciously* feel safe. Consciously, logically feeling safety is not enough. I remember it took my first girlfriend 3 tries before I was able to get and stay hard with her. I thought I was gay or bi but the same happened with two guys I was attracted to. I feel this intense anxiety about anything beyond making out. And I’m not at all asexual. I want to do and be what i feel unable to. When i was younger my fantasies involved me being physically hurt by my partner. That got more into BDSM as I got older. 

I have had recurring nightmares of reaching for a door handle that is too high for me to reach for as long as I can remember. Occasionally i scream and fight in my sleep. I wake up drenched in sweat like four nights a week. When I was little I would build a wall of pillows between myself and my door, which evolved into sleeping only on the edge of the bed. And I just would not sleep. I would stay up so late. 

I have come to realize that there is anger and guilt that exists deep inside me that manifests as self hate, unexplained rage, and self damage (how do I say in English that sometimes I bang my hands on my head, like I attack myself). 

Since I was about 8 years old I have felt depressed. Anxiety came in junior high, and i was self harming from age 13-18. I’ve been suicidal for longer than i can remember. No origin of that exists in my mind. In hindsight I can see that I have been disassociating since like 8 years old as well. I used to think that I have attention problems but in uni I learned that my focus can be top tier when studying or working on subjects i love. This is coming from someone who is currently suspended from uni after tanking two semesters because I simply didn’t care. 

Now I am 22, it is 4am, and I realized that I have almost no memory of my grandfathers second wife. I remember my grandfather so well, and he was nearly silent Russian man. I remember my aunt who had a disability. I spent a lot of time with them during summers. But I have next to no memories of his wife, who was in the picture before I was born. I remember one day which was when we were making cookies inside while my brother was outside. I remember getting brown sugar out of their cabinets. I remember how the floor felt. What the sugar containers looked like. I remember so much,  but I can’t remember any memories of her beyond that. She was a huge part of in my life from my birth until my grandpas death, when I was 11. After that my mom basically kicked her out of our family because of unrelated things (she was kind of a gold digger it seems)

I feel so confused and In my mind I don’t want to accuse her of anything. But I just find it weird that I have been dealing with all of this stuff and now I realize I can’t remember anything about her except this one moment. Is it possible to not remember being sexually abused?"
I want to stop existing,"I want to preface this by saying I’m not suicidal in any way shape or form, I’m just upset about life. I finally got over my ex, who was distant and never had time for me, but was the first person I had ever had a relationship with, so it took a few years. Now that I’ve moved on, I’ve wanted to start dating again, but I’ve had countless rejection, part of me thinks it’s because I’m overweight, the other part of me thinks it’s because I’m not worth it. I’m constantly plagued by the thought of my friends hating me because I’m too reliant on them, and that the only reason they keep me around is out of being nice. Everyone I’ve had a crush on in my entire life has always had a crush on my best friend, who I think only keeps me around anymore out of obligation. I’m a fuckup and a failure, I lost my job after reporting being sexually harassed by someone higher up in the company, and I feel like I should’ve just kept my mouth shut. I feel like a failure because nothing I do will ever measure up in my mother’s eyes to my eldest sister, for reference, I had a moment of peace and clarity, so I chose to clean up my house, and my mother’s response was that I should’ve done that already. My father never cared about me and frequently abused my siblings and I as children, and when I was a kid, I thought the world of him, but now there’s only bitterness and hate. As a kid, I lost both my uncle and great grandfather to suicide, and I was showed the room my great grandfather shot himself in by my father in an effort to “toughen me up”. I’m sorry that none of this is making sense, if anyone reads these, I’m just having a rough time of it, and the only place I can talk about it is here, on a throwaway account so people don’t link it back to my main account. I don’t want pity, I just want things to make sense, why am I in so much pain, why are there never any good days anymore? I have been talking to my therapist about this stuff, but I don’t have insurance at the moment, so I can’t afford to see them any longer, plus with all this coronavirus shit, I can’t get a job, so I’m just stuck, and I want to have never existed, just, no memories of me, no feelings attached to me, nobody having ever interacted with me, I wish everyone would have the life where I wasn’t involved, so they could live better lives, because all I do is ruin everything"
I really don't like gym class,"Gym class you know you have those units based on certain sports and every time I get in these units where you can pick your partner or group nobody picks me but people talk to me and all out of gym class normally and in gym class so why does no one say""Hey want to be my partner"" I can't take much more of it because it brings me to actually tears thinking no one cares I told my mom about it and she said I'm a nice young man and I still have my family I felt happy about that but still in the end no one will willingly go with me."
Maybe I'm a bit depressed.,"I'm in high school right now, don't really have friends since I think I look to angry or cold to be approachable. Now I'm on winter break and have nothing too much time so it's bothering me a bit. My sleep schedule is wack now since I'm preparing for a show my friends and I are preparing for school so I fall asleep late, wake up early feel sleepy and fall asleep then can't sleep until later. I've been playing video games and that takes my mind off of it but I still feel uneasy. This usually happens on every winter break but something feels different about this time."
I am tormented in my dreams with my first love.,"In don't really want to get into much detail about my personal life. But i need to express how much i've been suffering at my own hands (or by my own mind more likely). Im a high school student, \[17M\] and im not very social. But about two years ago when i was depressed and beaten up by life, i met a girl who eventually became the first person i have ever trully felt in love with, and it was one of those cases where *THAT ONE IS THE RIGHT ONE*. But, long story short... I messed up by being the awkward and anxious kid i used to be, we got separated and the only way i could talk to her was by messaging, but my depression affected my relationship with her by trying to get her to love me by making her think i needed her to live. In the last message i had with her, she got angry with me by always thinking she didn't wanted to see me.

Since then, we have both moved on. But recently, i have been having dreams that just keep getting worse.

First, it started with me seeing her somewhere, then i proceeding to run after her before i lost her, but she always dissapeared, or it was somebody else. So on and so forth.

But then, my dreams actually let me see her. Even in dreams, the moment i saw her and heard her voice, i felt as my heart skipped a beat. I hadn't felt as happier since i lost her in real life, so you could imagine how seeing her in my dream felt for me.

I talked to her, hugged her like we used to. It felt so real, but then, one moment i look away, and she is gone. The world turns darker and im just left alone.

But the worse so far, has been when my mind puts me through dreams where she is there, but in danger. I can only hear her scream in panic, i just run and run for what feels hours. Only for me to wake up before getting to her.

To this day, i keep looking for her, anxious to see her out in the city. I look for her in every social media. But i've only gotten her twitter from 5 years ago.

I just want the dreams to stop, for my mind to stop harrasing me with such dreams. But i DO want to see her again, even if she has a boyfriend, i just want to see her again and apologize for everytime i acted so manipulative with my depression. To make things right."
Update #2,"I’m the girl in Las Vegas for the holiday.

On the night of Christmas Eve I slept on a deflating air mattress. We forgot the cap for it at home. I now share a twin bed with my sister. It’s great. So on Christmas Day we went to church. Then we came straight back to the hotel. We cooked and ate and the older adults talked. I wrote articles for work and everyone was on their phones. My little cousin just played on his grandmas(my aunt) phone the entire time. I felt bad because my little 7 year old cousin didn’t get any gifts, unwrap anything, leave cookies for Santa, or have a Christmas tree. He doesn’t have any toys with him to play with. His mom is not here and I think he misses her. I know she is working and couldn’t afford to come so last minute. I don’t know why my aunt took him away from her and brought him here without any Christmas plans for him. She told him his presents are at home. I think that is the most fucked up thing that has happened. I didn’t know he was going to be here. I wish I had made him something. I’m mad at myself and my family. My mom did bring him an old ass book of my brothers, but it’s not wrapped and I can tell he’s not going to want it since it’s not really his age. I don’t count it as a Christmas present. It was thoughtless. 

It has been 4 days and we have not spent money on anything until today: my parents, sisters and aunt and cousin went to go see an MJ concert tonight. My sister is leaving tomorrow. She flew all the way here to only see a fucking Michael Jackson imitation. My brother and I are in the hotel now because we stayed behind because we both can’t afford/don’t want to spend money on the concert because we aren’t into Michael Jackson. My brother is applying to summer internships and I’m writing articles for work. We have spent every day in the hotel, except yesterday when we went to church for an hour and walked down the strip. 


If you’re wondering, everything about this vacation bothers the fuck out of me.

Edit: I forgot one more thing, before leaving for the MJ show my mom was freaking out about a crack in the hotel door. (The resort seems to be a bit old, old appliances and shit, there’s a CD player boom box!!) She kept asking if someone had forced their way in while they were away (they went for a walk down the strip, not buying anything or doing anything). She said like three times “it looks like someone has forced their way in!!” asking my brother if anything had happened. I felt slightly attacked by this, being the only adult home with my brother. Why the fuck would I not tell her that first if it happened. She called management like the Karen she is to come fix it. (They did come, with tools and everything)."
I'm so ugly,I haven't had a girlfriend in almost 6 years. I'm so lonely and it's been so long since I've had any sort of connection with anyone. I don't want to go to work anymore because of how ugly I am. I don't want to go out with coworkers because of how I look.
I've never had a guy interested in me.,I've never had a guy show interest in me. But at that same time I don't have my shit together mentally and lifestyle wise to be prepared to deal with people.
My classmate from secondary school just announced she's pregnant. Why does it bother me? I don't even want to have children,"Maybe I simply envy the fact that she's married and I have never had a BF in my life, and at this point in life, I'd like to know what's like being with someone in a committed relationship? I have never had a relationship of any kind.

Nor FWA or being in more than 5 dates.

Why does it bother me?"
I'm losing my passion for violin,"I've accepted that I don't wanna be a musician as my career and that playing violin is fun when I do what I want vs trying to get good enough to be a professional playing gigs and shit. Also I don't care about it as much as I used to, like having to do it every day feels like a chore instead of something fun that I want to do. There's still plenty of times where I play and it's cool and satisfying, but a lot of times I'm just not in the mood, and I hate feeling like I *have* to play. So I decided that violin can just be a hobby that I do when I feel like and orchestra is for shits and giggles instead of preparing me for my career.

Well I've been practicing less cuz I don't care as much and I feel guilty cuz of how much stress my old teacher put on me to practice *every day,* so now I feel like I'm doing something wrong by not practicing even though I don't want to (not that I never will but only if I'm in the mood). Today I had enough and decided to practice to make the guilt go away, but when I did it wasn't cool or fun or anything, it felt like a chore just like before. At least I'm more prepared and comfortable with the new song I got but still it wasn't too fun.I thought trying to figure out how to play a song I like by ear would make it more fun (I did that and the new song) but it wasn't. So I felt guilty for not doing it but didn't enjoy doing it.

When I finished I got the same feeling I always get after practicing like I'm done with everything I need to do for the day and can finally relax, but it wasn't satisfying. Idk how to let go of the guilt and be okay with not practicing as much but still enjoy it when I do practice. Maybe I just need to get used to it cuz it's so new. It doesn't help that I put a lot of my identity into being a musician, even when I was denying to myself I wasn't enjoying it as much I still forced it. And my mom is big on music and loved it growing up so she makes it a big deal for us to, saying even if I'm not gonna be a musician I shouldn't lose my skills. That makes me feel guilty too.

This was kinda dumb and messy whoops"
short on my till,"today, for the first time in the whole year and a half that i’ve been working there, i was short 54 dollars on my till. i think that was because a lady wanted 50 dollars change in toonies & loonies but i only had a large amount of 5 dollar bills. i offered the 50 in 5’s and i think she must have taken it without giving me the 50 dollar bill because that is the only possible way i could have been short. i don’t understand how careless i was to not make sure i had that 50 dollars back but this is the second time in two weeks i’ve gotten in trouble and now i’m scared that this was the last straw."
"I’ve posted twice about this, this is an update.","I broke up with my girlfriend, she was still stuck on her ex and was not investing into me as much as I was her.... she told me she wanted a break this week since she was at camp, but I came to my senses and I called it off, I can’t deal with that mentally and emotionally. Thank you those who gave me advice...."
Found out my girlfriend does drugs and I can't stop thinking about it,"A few disclaimers/apologies:
-I currently working for another 7 hours and I'm working on this throughout my shift between rushes. I'm sorry if my thoughts seem to jump around.
-The drugs aren't anything of the major ones ex: heroine and cocaine

Ok here's a few placeholder names and ages. Coworker (cw) is in his late 20's and girlfriend (gf) and I are both 17

So this is what's bothering me. About a month ago I found out that my girlfriend used marijuana recreationally (no it is no legal in my state). J found out one day because after our shift we were headed to get wings with our coworker. I was slow clocking out because I felt the need to help out a little after my shift. Eventually I walked out back and saw the two smoking together. My first thought was ""Oh yikes I didn't know she smoked"". When cw saw me he asked if I was ready to go and we headed out. Before we sat down cw turn to my gf and said ""I wonder if it was a bad idea to smoke weed, cause now I'm about to drink a beer. Hope it isn't dangerous"". At this point I am just shocked. The rest of the night was me pretending to space out while my gf, cw, and CW's friend were eating. The next day I talked things through with my gf and told her that she can keep doing what's she's doing as long as she keeps herself safe (like not endangering her body or getting into trouble with the law). I also told her drugs were a touchy subject with me and to not talk about it in front of me.

Fast forward about a month to today. I'm in for a 10 hour shift with cw. While working I hear him mutter to himself, and I asked him what was on his mind. He turns to me and told me that he was wondering if he should start his mushroom plot (no not normal mushrooms) for my gf before or after he leaves for his vacation.

Now I get if you're scoffing at this and saying that I'm overreacting over something so small and I totally understand that. I was raised by a very strict dad and a paranoid schizophrenic mom. I hate to blame my mom but I think my habit of over thinking/worrying about every small thing comes from her. Ever since I was a kid, I was taught to be the type of person to always follow rules and to stay in line. This definitely made me a more reserved person who is afraid of taking risks no matter how small. Because of these things my brain is always running wild and it has been for the past 5 hours now. I'm just scared that she might get hurt while on drugs or even move on to stronger and more dangerous drugs.

I know you guys are going to say, so here's somethings I can answer now:

Why don't you ask your parents for advice?
- My parents wouldn't allow me to continue seeing her if they found out about this

Try to talk her into quitting?
- She is a free spirit who hates limitations/restrictions being put on what she can or cannot do. Also it is her life not my life and I shouldn't interfere too much.

Why don't you talk to her family about it?
- Her only family (mom and grandma) actually do these types of drugs as well

Any advice is greatly appreciated and even if you don't have any, thank you for reading"
23yo - Unemployed - I dont know what to do with my Life,"Hello everybody, 

My name is Alex, as you can see in the title I am 23yo and few weeks ago I became unemployed.

I was working for a small online gift shop company for 3years where I was dealing with everything there from A-Z: Contact suppliers to order the needed stuff, talk with customers, use all the machines we have to craft the products that we were making, doing new desings for new products, everything that was related to the online shop, literally everything. 

2 and half months ago I asked for a promotion/salary increase since I started to have issues with my budget, and ofc my ""boss"" declined as the business during the summer doesnt have that much income. Then since my apettite for work  decreased alot due to not enjoying anymore what I was doing and the rewards I was getting, so I have tried to talk with him for one more time and again the same story, so I decided that will be better for me if I will go somewhere else to work. I was still working there until 3weeks ago where I said enough its time to move on with my life and my career.

Since then, I am constantly looking for similar jobs since its something that I already have some solid experience and I somehow like doing, you see, I like everything that is related to computers and graphics.

Now my biggest issue is that I live in a small island(Cyprus), there are not many jobs in simillar domain, and I feel that I dont want to have a boss anymore, I would love to make something for myself, have my own thing, that will make me wanna wake up or not even sleep some nights and build it, I would like my own business , but I dont know where,how and what to do as I dont know what I really enjoy doing with my life. I love talking with different people, have weird convos about the universe, about our existance, about this type of stuff. I like reading others people personal experiences in life, business experiences and so on. I like editing photos in Photoshop as its something that I have learned and still learning since I was 10 because was something that I really love doing. I like fizing computers, trying to figure out why is not working and so on. But at this point I feel that I have no energy for life, I feel that I suck and that I cant do a shit anymore. 

I will just leave this text here, I needed to write it down so I can release a bit of my stress that I have now since I have no income but I have shit to pay.

Advance thanks for those that will read my post, and sorry for my grammar and bad English."
My bf has depression and I don't know what to do,"We have a long 8 year relationship, so we know each other very well, but since my boyfriend was diagnosed with depression last year and started medication things have been a little bit difficult to handle. So, it's been almost two weeks since we don't have a real conversation. He is avoiding me and avoiding physical touch. I know that I am not a very warm person and I am lazy sometimes. He said he was feeling lonely and he thinks we may have lost something in our relationship, and I was feeling very lonely too but tried not to talk about it because I thought that his problemas were more important and I shouldn't bother him with my feelings of loneliness and sadness since he's already struggling with depression. But I am so confused because yesterday he said that he was avoiding contact and that may be a medication collateral effect, and I should be patient. But I am so confused. I don't know what to do to help him or cheer him up, since he doesn't want me around, and at the same time I don't have anyone to talk to, I am also feeling lonely and apatetic and can't even talk to him about it. I am feeling so lost and have cried almost every night and he doesn't seem to care. What the hell is going on with my life?"
All I wanted was someone to watch endgame with,"*written in real time on route to six flags over California for a senior end-of-year trip.*

&#x200B;

All I want is someone to watch endgame with

&#x200B;

Right now I'm on a greyhound in between Las Vegas and Magic Mountain, not even two hours into a six hour trip. It is 5:30 and we should reach the hotel by 9 pm. If I decide to post this, it'll probably have to wait until I get to the hotel. To be honest, I've had something to say here for a very long time, but I didn't want to talk about it in case I was wrong. But I'm not wrong about what I feel.

I'm writing this in Notepad on my laptop, so apologies for random line drops.

It's a Senior end of school trip, and I know everyone's name just as well as they know my name. Yet, I am somehow just far enough not to be able to talk to my own clique -- Tom, Noah, and Anne -- and close enough to read their faces and hear their conversations. Who I would consider my three closest friends are sitting  just ahead of me in two rows of two seats. There is a fourth empty seat, but I can't sit there because the person sitting there, Noah, says he gets claustrophobic, and after knowing the kind of stuff he deals with on a daily business, i decide not  to challenge him on that.  So the people in my general vicinity are all listening to music and catching up on sleep, and I can't help but watch my closest friends on the bus ride of their life. I'm one of those kids that ends up moving schools a lot. I spent each year of  middle school somewhere else, and I'm graduating high school from the third  high school I've attended. It even cost me taking a calculus class since I kept switching curriculum's. Though I don't feel knew to the school, it's been only a year here since my birthday in march. Of Tom, Noah, and Anne, I've known each person for different amounts of times. Noah, i met first in elementary school, and met him here again after I had thought I said goodbye to him for the last time in middle school. A lot has happened to him since then and I'm still learning piece by piece. Tom, I met after shadowing him a week before I was enrolled in this newest school. We ended up having a near identical schedule except for Latin, so it was pretty easy to become friends with him. We even became Public Forum partners and took our skills to a tournament in Arizona. And then there's Anne. I knew Anne by name when i first started  going here, but it was only since the beginning of this school year that I  started talking to her more. Between us, we are the only seniors on the speech and debate team, meaning it was pretty easy for us to keep close. But then there's this curse that anyone who's always switching schools carries: the moment you truly feel close, you're on your way out the door. In this case, we left for Magic Mountain right after a college declaration assembly in which Noah said he'd go to UNLV, Anne to SUU, Tom to Washington State, and myself to UNR. These are our last moments, and I can only watch them. The worst of it is that I never even felt like a close friend to these people, rather just the  fourth guy that showed up one day. To them, I feel like only a PF partner, only a Speech and Debate teammate, and nothing more. 

All I wanted was someone to watch endgame with. It's been I think three weeks,  and not one of us four had gotten around to seeing it. Because it's about the end of the school year now, AP exams finally out of the way, I thought we could see Endgame together. I asked Tom first, but he told me he was busy. I'm always left to assume with him because he's always busy and then I ask him Monday how his weekend was and he'll tell me he didn't do anything. I was on my way to ask Noah second, but I didn't even bother with him. He got into really bad trouble  that kicked him off the Debate team and his mother doesn't let him leave the house anymore unless it's a mandatory school event. And then Anne. Now if I can take a second to be fully honest, I am in love with Anne. It's not just one of those teenage crushes you get every 7 seconds you spend with a cute girl you wish you might hang out with more often. I know, because I swore off that at the beginning  of the school year, and every second with her, the thought never crossed my mind. I only realized how I felt about her when we hung out at prom. I told her that I  wished I asked somebody, anybody, out to prom and she asked me who, and I didn't  respond because in my mind, I was about to tell her ""you."" Anyways, I ended up asking everyone else, kept getting the same answers, and ended up watching the damn movie by myself in the dead of night at some little theater out of a casino. I'd give it an 9 out of 10. I really liked the scene where Steve Rogers picked up mjolnir. Tom already dated another ex of mine this year. Jane. Last year, I took Jane to  Junior prom, and we lasted about about two months after that. For the longest  time, Tom and Jane were always fighting with each other, Jane being Chinese, Tom liked to show her pictures of Tienanmen Square and say ""That's you, lol."" I don't know why they decided to forget all that for six months to have some sort of show-up romance. I actually don't take it personally, but it really bothered me because Jane was still uncomfortable talking to me and wanting to take Tom away from me so that they'd have more time together. That's why I'm scared that the more time they end up spending together, the more likely they'll be dating when I finally say something.

That's why I've made a promise -- and I don't make promises too often -- to tell Anne before the bus ride home Friday morning. Now there's another three hours left to the hotel. I can only hope I have a chance to talk to her some more when we get there before. 

&#x200B;

they're holding hands nvm.

*I'm finally at the hotel, and things have just gotten worse. I slipped in the pool fully clothed and my phone is not water proof. My the contents of my wallet are gone. There is no dryer. I'm trying to be optimistic, guys, but it's really hard.*"
I am a teenager that might have a crush on one of her best friends.,"There’s also this thing about social anxiety, but I won’t get into that. I am a girl, and I have this friend that is a girl. Even before I came to my school, I had always seen myself as LGBT. I was never really sure of it, until now. When I met her, I thought she was so pretty, and now she’s a really good friend of mine, and here’s why I’m suspicious. I just want to make her proud, and I want her to look at me like she loves me. Like, idk she’s in love with me. But at the same time, I can’t and do not want to imagine that because I’m scared and whenever I think that I always feel weird for thinking about her that way. I get so angry for imagining things like that. Please help, do I really like her? You can ask me anything you need, but I need to know because it has been bothering me so much. Thank you,,"
An entire day of panic about my shoes...,"Hi. So I should probably preface this with the fact I have anxiety and it's been super messing me up for a while. I'm sort of in a bad patch with it at the moment and so I can't stop obsessing over what happened yesterday. 

So I'm at the station waiting for the train when a random dude comes up to me and says, ""having white shoelaces on Doc Martens is a neo-na zi thing, you know that?"" I didn't, and so I said so, then I asked where the white on my shoes was because I didn't know there was any. Then he looks closer and says ""Oh wait, never mind, they're yellow,"" because, ya know, that's what they are. Anyway since then I can't stop completely obsessing over what color my shoelaces are despite the fact I know they're black and yellow and they haven't magically changed colors overnight but now I'm extremely worried someone else is gonna see them wrong and think I'm some far right extremist, which I am 100% definitely not and I reject their horrible worldview entirely. I don't have the energy to be too nervous to wear my shoes but the whole incident has totally messed with my head just because some random dude can't see properly. I did some research and apparently yellow is anti-racist in some circles too. I just needed to ramble about this because it's super messed me up and like all my stress tics have come back and I hate it."
It's my bday and I'm still thinking of you.,And I'm pretty sure I don't mean anything to you.
"Sexually confused, friendless, and frustrated","I’m really not sure how to start this, but here goes.

This year, after hating my time at summer camp and making no friends, is the year I’m going away from home. 

All throughout high school I’ve gotten straight As, done well on the violin, played some video games. So, instead of focusing on my grades this year and especially this semester, I’ve decided to focus on the fact that I don’t enjoy my life at all. 

First came my sexuality. I’ve always been someone who’s super conscientious - always want to fix myself, never really enjoying the moment. The thing is, when I was around 12, I started paying more attention to guys and, even though I’d had a gay moment or two as a kid, I totally denied it. Now, a lot of gay kids do that, but the problem is that after forcing myself not to look at guys for a summer, I literally lost my whole sex drive. I feel totally confused. I know it’s useless to stress more, but I just can’t get the stress off my mind. I’m constantly worried about what I’m attracted to. And I wonder if being gay is even worth it or what I want. 

On top of that, I have absolutely no friends. I have 2 people I talk to at school, both of which I feel like Im just trying to please so I’m not totally alone. I try my hardest to relate to them, but I just end up a) stressed out b) not enjoying talking to them or c) feeling alone once they reject me. I feel useless. I don’t even really feel a drive to hang out with anyone. It just stresses me out and is no fun. I’m totally quiet in groups.

Then came the frustration. I am so freaking frustrated with all of this. Why can’t I have friends? Why can’t I have a normal sexuality - gay or straight (I want to be with someone!)? Why can’t I enjoy playing my violin, or being with friends, or just doing anything in my life? I feel like I try so hard and stress so much and it goes nowhere...

I feel like a total moron posting this, but here goes. Thanks for reading.

My post was removed from r/SuicideWatch. I hate this world. I hate my body. This is my story. Sorry for the giant wall.,"Like the title says, I posted this to r/SuicideWatch a few months back, but it got removed the same day so here I am. The mods never gave me a reason. Maybe my post was too edgy or maybe they thought I was trolling. But I assure you that what I'm about to tell you is 100% real. I wrote this from a place of anger, so keep that in mind. You can PM me if you want. I didn't get much of a response from the other sub anyway. I just need to post this somewhere to get all this shit off my chest and liked the look of this sub. The only reason I've waited so long to post this is because I'm afraid and embarrassed. It's kinda stupid that I'm afraid when no one really cares anyway. Sorry for the wall.

The fact someone like me exists is surely stunning evidence that there is no such thing as a loving god. Day in and day out, all I see inside my head is death, pain, gore, murder, torture, and all thoughts obscene and extreme. These are the thoughts I fall asleep to almost every night. You'd be horrified if you stepped into my mind for just one minute. But I was not always this way. I remember days when I was optimistic, happy, kind, and social. I wanted friendship. But I've changed. I post and comment every now and then on my main account, but I'm using an alt because...I dunno. In the deep recesses of my black heart, the final bastion of goodness cries out for compassion. When I'm in public, people see my manners, smile, and good looks but they don't see the darkness that lies beneath the surface. I just need to get this all off my chest and hope someone out there can hear me and understand why I feel the way that I do, because it feels like the world is my enemy right now.

I wasn't born from Satan's sperm or anything like that. My birth was like any other, with crying parents, excited grandparents, and all that shit. Why bring this up? Because when I was born, my parents were faced with a decision, one that would not effect them, but would greatly effect me, and they chose the wrong one. But I'm not going to tell you what this decision was, because it took me 18 years to figure it out, and I want you to experience my life in the order I experienced it. If you're one of the few who feels the way I do, then maybe you've already guessed what that decision was and can see where this is headed. For both of my parents, I was their first son. I lived a sheltered childhood growing up in a literal crack-den, because my parents are poor as shit. I had no friends or social interactions before school, so going to school was the first time I really began learning about myself and about the world. One of the first things I learned about myself was what a romantic I was, of course I didn't know the word at the time, but you get the idea. I remember even having a crush on a girl as early as Kindergarten for chrissakes. I was such a sucker. Only problem is it's hard making friends when you're the weird kid who smells like drugs and dresses like shit. I was able to find some, though.

Despite my poor upbringing, I had rich neighbors. There was one family in particular we'll call the Walsh family (none of the names on the post are real). The Walsh family had a son a little older than me named Jesse I hung out with a lot. He was a bit of a dick, but it was worth it because he owned tons of video games and also because of his older sister, Kelsey. I had a huge crush on her until the whole molestation thing soured my feelings. Kelsey was eight years older than I, and she could tell I was into her. Every now and then, she'd blow me a kiss, call me 'prince', or something like that, and I'd get that warm fuzzy feeling inside. Seems innocent on its own, but that all changed one autumn afternoon when I was 8 years old. The parents in the Walsh family were each in high paying professions that took a lot of hours, so Jesse would go play sports after school, but Kelsey preferred staying at home to study by herself. None of the neighbor kids were around to play with me, so I went up to the Walsh house to see if someone was there. I cringe to type what happened next. Kelsey was the only one there, and she invited me in. I asked if she wanted to play outside, but instead she just said, “No, but c'mere. I wanna show you something REALLY cool.” I remember those were her exact words. She leads me into her bedroom, sits me down at the computer, and shows me what I didn't realize at the time was porn. It took me a while to realize that what I was seeing was sex. My parents already had “the talk” with me, but I never knew people had sex for pleasure or what it really looked like. Kelsey started touching me through my pants and encouraged me to do the same to her. When I left an hour later, she threatened, “You can't tell anyone about this. Our parents will be REALLY mad at you and me if someone finds out, so don't, okay?” Exact words. And being the big, smart, sixteen year old high school student twice my age, I trusted her. Now, if I were smart and told someone, that'd be where the story ended, but confusion, fear, curiosity, and my stupid feelings drew me back to Kelsey. I think when most people picture child molestation, they imagine rough, violent rape. But my experience was one of masterful manipulation and was...affectionate for lack of a better word (sorry I don't really know how else to describe it). And obviously it evolved into things more graphic than touching through pants that I'm gonna spare myself from detailing. The bitch would lie to me the whole time that she loved me and would use my feelings to guilt trip me into doing shit I didn't want. “But don't you love me?” “I'll love you forever if you do this for me.” Also shit like, “This is why no one likes you.” “Don't be such a loser.” Cunt. Even though disgust and violation eventually set in, I stupidly kept going back. I was so confused and curious and wanted answers, but more than that, I wanted her to love me back. And I stupidly believed every proclamation of her love. Feeling like the cutest thing in the world was juxtaposed with feeling gross and disgusted. Feeling violated with feeling loved. I guess my parents never were suspicious because it's normal to hang out with neighborhood kids, right? Right. They also trusted Kelsey. I think she reminded my mother of her two daughters from her previous marriage. And what kid wants to hang out in a crack-den all day anyway?

In a twist of fate, Kelsey left for college early after nine months of this shit, and I never heard from her since. I guess she was real smart or something. There's no such thing as justice. Bad shit never happens to bad people, only good people. And that was it. I felt simultaneously relieved and sad at her departure. But after a while, I just stopped thinking about her. It wasn't until I was eleven that new feelings about what I went through popped up. I hated what she did to my body, I felt gross, hurt, sad, self hate, guilt and regret, but most of all I felt pure, astronomical hatred. It eats me up inside knowing I won't get justice for this. Puberty hit me harder than a nitro powered freight train, and as I started exploring my sexuality, I hated how I was aroused by kinks she had previously acted out on me. I've tried to get rid of them, but it's like they're fused deep into my brain. I felt tainted, like my sexuality could never truly be my own. I know the stereotype of a molestation victim is a person who is terrified by everything sexual, but rarely is the opposite outcome talked about where you become a hyper sexual person with several of the most extreme kinks. I've always wanted answers about why she did what she did, and I've heard everything from pedophilia being a disease to being an unconventional sexuality, but I've never seen an answer that satisfied me. I never told my parents because the idea of having any sort of conversation about sex or sexuality with them makes me cringe. Nor did I tell Jesse or his parents. Instead, I scoured the internet for answers on what to do. Quickly, I found my plight dismissed, told I was lucky to be abused by that bitch, and ridiculed. But that's just the internet, right? Surely, my friends wouldn't feel the same. The few friends I had ridiculed me when I opened up to them. They told me I was lucky and that I should've liked it. Because she was a conventionally attractive high school girl, so surely the problem was with me, right? I left the friends behind who rejected my plight. In the end, I was left with only two good friends. One was a dude we'll call Casey, and he was the first person to actually listen, but we've never talked much about because of how clearly it makes him uncomfortable. We're the type of friends talking serious with is hard. The second was a girl we'll call Isabel. She was a cynical misanthrope, and the first to actually have a face to face conversation with me about this aside from ridicule. During this conversation, she said to me, “But you're still you.” And those words changed my life.

I thought so hard about what Isabel said, and she was absolutely right. I lost control for a while, but in the end, I was still here. I was back in control. My body was the same. It was still mine. The fact Kelsey did this to me didn't matter. I was in control. My body was the same. So much of the violation and sadness I felt faded to the back of my mind all at once. It was an incredible feeling, like seventy thousand tons of death had been lifted off my shoulders. That night, I shed a tear for the last time. Ever since, I've been physically incapable of crying, though sometimes I wish I could for the catharsis. But there was one thing that remained: the pure, unfiltered, aggressive hatred I have for that cunt. I've grown up since I was eight, and nowadays I'm over six feet tall, muscular, and I've had over a decade of training in martial arts, so if I want to hurt someone, I'm terrifyingly capable. And that's what I want. I want to obliterate Kelsey. They say vengeance is an eye for an eye, but I value my body a helluva lot more than I value my enemy's. Vengeance never actually goes that way. It's more like ripping her left arm off and using the jagged, exposed bone to gouge out her eyes. I would love to stab her guts out, to use a knife to violate her body the way she violated mine, to kill her the way she killed the version of me that was happy, social, optimistic, and has never heard of r/SuicideWatch. She'd be so helpless and weak at my mercy, just like I was back then. But she wouldn't dare show her face near me. She wouldn't dare if she knew the bastard I've become, because there's no way a short, skinny woman like her would ever be able to put up a fight against me. But I won't do anything because the law forbids it. The sound of her crying and begging would be music to my ears, because whenever I think of her, my blood runs a helluva lot colder than hers or anyone wasting their time by reading about my stupid ass. I wonder what kind of man I'd be had I never met that cunt. Guess I'll never know. Maybe I sound like a monster for wanting to inflict the most inhumane torture your worst nightmare could never come up with on her, but you know what? From where I stand, it's Kelsey who seems like the monster to me. And that's why I don't want eye for an eye style revenge. To me, my eye is more important than her eye is to me. She deserves it. Maybe you can't relate because you don't know how it feels to be violated. But I bet you'd feel a similar excruciating, colossal rage if I were your child, if I were your lover, if I were your sibling. Imagine the person you love most in the world getting raped by some degenerate. You'd scream for vengeance. When you push someone's buttons enough, we're all the same primal beast buried beneath the lie we call civility. All of us are capable of feeling the same bestial rage when we've been fucked with enough. It's weird that we have a suicide hotline, a subreddit, and all sorts of resources, but there's no homicide hotline as far as I'm aware. No one wants to talk about it. People like to pretend they can't understand why someone would want to take a life, but that's bullshit. Deep down, they understand it. I'm suicidal anyway, and from where I stand, killing my enemies doesn't seem much different from ending it all. I'm already dead inside anyway.

It was at this point I became what I call a soft misanthrope. I didn't actually hate mankind, but I was perpetually disappointed. Humans are such obstinate beings, and everywhere you look you'll find poverty, pointless violence, abuse, and irrationality. Most will not accept harsh truths even if they stare them in the face. I quickly concluded that the “golden rule” was true. If we treated everyone how we'd like to be treated, there'd be no violence nor avoidable suffering in this world. And to truly adopt this principle, an individual would need to learn to love everyone as much as they love themselves. I think it was Ghandi who said be the change you want to see in the world or something like that, so I decided to strive to be what I would call the ideal human. I was kind to others, optimistic, I'd listen without judgment, I never lied, I immersed myself in academics, and I tried my damnedest to be a good friend to everyone. But deep down, I always knew why being optimistic about humanity is bullshit. As long as this bestial, primal shadow deep within our subconscious exists, there will always be suffering. We hurt others by living life on a whim without even realizing it, and birth hate into this world without realizing it. I'm not going to do it, but if I killed Kelsey, many would call my vengeance justice. And I could stop her from grooming someone else. Though most would never vocalize it, deep down many would cheer the inhumane torture. But at the same time, I'd steal from two parents their daughter, a brother his sister, perhaps children their mother. And all of them would want to kill me and deliver to me the same justice I had to Kelsey. This primal, animalistic shadow controls us in more ways than we even realize. We feel it every time we lust for another's body, every time we gluttonously devour junk food, and every time we watch Kill Bill and cheer as Uma Thurman kills her enemies. See? Whether or not you want to admit it, the shadow has still infused the capacity to take a life into you. We like the violence in Kill Bill when it's done by Beatrix Kiddo but not by Budd because we relate to Beatrix. The only reason you can relate to her without hating her is because you too have the emotional capacity to commit her violence if you were standing in her shoes. Strip away all our material possessions, material desires, relationships, and social conditioning, and we're just beasts who eat, kill, fuck, repeat. Peace is not the natural order of mankind.

People do not form their worldview and beliefs through critical analysis and the indifferent pursuit of truth, but instead through the passive unconscious process of cultural osmosis. That is how one is simultaneously capable of being appalled by rape when done by a man to a woman yet look me in the eye and tell me I was lucky. They have no principles. Just random, unoriginal ideas absorbed from the culture around them. They project their fantasy onto reality and perceive the world filtered through their cultural brainwashing. When you take an honest look around at this fucked up world, filled with bastards like Kelsey, like me, filled with poverty, populated by humans so greedy, so dishonest, so obstinate, so cruel, so irrational, so passive, so indifferent, so uncritical, perhaps I'm not insane. Maybe sadness, depression, anger, misanthropy, antisocial behavior, wanting to die, and suicide are the sane reactions to an insane world. It is through this cultural brainwashing that traditions survive. I hate tradition. Tradition is a word we use to dress up inhumanity and stubbornness as something noble, something to be respected, as opposed to moving forward, progressing, trying something new, developing better ways of life. For me, there is one tradition in particular that sets my brain on fire. Many have been hurt by this tradition, but for most it's an unimportant detail of their life. Most barely give it a second thought and passively accept it, but obviously that's not true for me. I hate it. It is the subject of crude banter, yet also outrage from few voices. You'll probably laugh when I say this, because many in American culture and elsewhere would say it is ridiculous to be upset over this. You're ridiculed by others if you confess to being upset about it, and I can practically feel the harsh skepticism, dismissal, and laughter some will give me as this as I type these words. The tradition I despise so deeply is male infant circumcision.

For the first 18 years of my life, I thought something about the manhood department always felt...off. The mechanics and anatomy of my manhood always felt so uncomfortable and inconvenient. Sometimes downright painful. But I never thought anything of it, and I never heard the word circumcision until I was a teenager, and even then I certainly never thought I was cut. As far as I knew, it was only something Jews did, and both my parents are atheists, so I figured I was safe. All of my anatomy textbooks throughout my life only ever showed circumcised dicks without mentioning that they had been circumcised, so I figured I was intact. But in reality I was botched. The doctor took off too much skin, making erections painful and tight, sometimes tearing the skin and causing me to bleed. But I never thought anything other than that's just how it is. I had no reason to believe I had been cut. I never even thought about it. It wasn't until I was 18 years old, watching porn in the privacy of my room I learned the truth. I remember seeing a thumbnail with an intact penis and was instantly intrigued. What the hell was up with his cock? I clicked on it and instantly thought how much more convenient it would be for me to have all that extra skin. And as far as I was aware, no other cocks were like that. They were all like mine, and this guy was just a lucky bastard. Then I scrolled down to the comments. Holy shit. What the hell was I reading? I couldn't possibly have been cut. No way, right? Well, I went over to google and got a picture comparing circ'd to uncirc'd. I stared at the pictures until it clicked and I nearly threw up. I had been circ'd and I'd been living a lie for the past 18 years of life. Instantly, those feelings of disgust and violation Kelsey had inflicted on me came boiling up again. Once again, I had no control. My body was controlled by others. Something I'm against doing to children on principle has been inflicted onto me. But I quickly realized my parents must've had good reason, right? Curiosity got to me, and I started reading everything I could get my hands on about foreskin and circumcision, and I gotta say, the more I learn, the more hurt I feel. I learned both of the purported health benefits and the downsides, the functions of the foreskin, and I realized truths I never knew existed. I never knew that I had been through so much pain and bleeding because too much skin was taken off. I just figured I had the normal amount of skin and everyone dealt with this. I read about so many potential side effects of this procedure, and I recognized nearly all of them in myself. I know most men might be okay with it, but when I finally realized what had been done to me, I felt raped all over again.

It took me a while to grow the balls to ask about it, but when I did I spoke to both of my parents at once. I simply asked, “Hey, you're each atheists, right? So why exactly did you get me circumcised?” I remember they looked at each other before my mother answered. “So you could be like your dad.” From what I hear, this is a common reason parents circ their kids. Again, I wanted to throw up. I already hated that this had been done to me, and it wasn't even done out of concern for my health or because I had some sort of problem that couldn't be resolved with more conservative methods, but out of cosmetic perversion. Out of a sick desire to make me match my father. If it were out of health concerns, I could accept that, but no. Because they wanted my dick to look a certain way. Fucking disgusting perverts. And the look like daddy excuse is such bullshit. Dad wouldn't have cut his cock off if I had been completely botched. It took every fiber of my being to not unleash a torrent of verbal razors in their direction. In that moment, I saw red. I saw Kelsey. But I did nothing because my parents love me, and what would murdering them in a fit of rage get for me aside from catharsis and a prison sentence? There are ways to get revenge that are legal, and if Kelsey taught me anything, it's that love is a weakness you can exploit. I don't want to see my parents again because all the feelings of violation, loss, sadness, helplessness, betrayal, rage, and disgust that bother me come swelling up at the sight of them. Unfortunately, they're still a small part of my life, but I'll be far the fuck away soon. Those fuckers are yet to realize how unfortunate they are to have a vengeful sadist like me for a son. I have a plan for revenge with no scams, violence, or any illegal channels. I'll make them regret their decision, and they're going to feel guilt for it, and they will watch helplessly as I disown them after I exploit them for every penny I can get out of them and unleash my verbal razors on them. I wonder what their stupid faces will look like when I tell them how violated I feel by them, how much I hate their guts, and that they will never speak to me again while I'm out in the world being more successful than those losers could ever dream of being. And it's their own fault. They'll probably feel devastation, loss, powerlessness, anger, and guilt. I probably sound cruel. But what about my loss? My powerlessness? My anger? How I feel violated and humiliated all over again because of them? I can't undo these feelings, but I sure as hell can hurt them to get some catharsis. I don't give a shit. Fuck turning the other cheek. Turning the other cheek is every coward's favorite passage because it lets them glorify their weakness as virtue and nobility. It flips the natural order of the world to make strength weakness and weakness strength. It's a passage for making slaves content in their subjugation. It allows evil to perpetually abuse while the weak gain pride from their suffering at the expense of seeing the truth. They're not going to inflict violation onto me and live their lives like it never happened. I'm not letting them live their happy lives thinking I love them just because that's what society says I should do. I live my life for myself and not for anyone else because I'm not a slave. Maybe if I'm REALLY lucky, each of them will get cancer before it's disowning time, and I'll get the pleasure of watching them die slowly and painfully, all while they falsely believe that I'm just their regular ol' loving son as I laugh at their pain behind their backs and collect the inheritance. They by-proxy initiated sexual violence against me. PAID someone to cut off part of my cock before I could even fathom the idea of consent for their own perverse desires. They can 100% go fuck themselves.

I hate my body, and unlike what I told myself to cope with what Kelsey did, my body is not the same. It was permanently altered without my consent for the satisfaction of perverts, and there's nothing I can do about it. How can my body ever truly be mine when part of me was cut off to satisfy perverts. I'm so fucking tired of people treating me and my body like it's just some plaything. The school bullies, Kelsey, my parents, the doctor. And being a person who is very sexual, I hate so deeply that my sexuality keeps getting altered by the whims of others. God, I just hate everything. History repeats itself, and again I took to the internet for the sake of discussion. I quickly found that even even though some vigorously oppose circumcising children, most were dismissive and ridiculed me all over again if I expressed feeling violated. And you can't change their mind. You can rant and rave until you're blue in the face, cite as many scientific papers and statistics as you want, debunk as many myths as you want, express your darkest feelings in the most visceral way possible and it changes nothing. You can demonstrate truth in a comparison of removal of the foreskin and some other bodily atrocity and people will only condemn one. George Orwell's doublethink is real and fucking terrifying. Unfortunately, though, I cannot get back what was stolen from me. The only hope the future holds for this possibility is a company called Foregen that wants to use regenerative medicine to undo circumcision. But that'll cost about 10k once it comes out, not to mention all the money the supporters have to donate just to make it possible. But why the fuck should I have to pay 10k to get back what I was entitled to by right of birth? To help restore the feeling of wholeness everyone is entitled to? And it's not like any attorney would try to help me sue my parents or the doctor who did this. So instead I'll just break their hearts. You can also stretch your shaft skin out, which I've done and has been immensely helpful, but that's just a mimic and doesn't take away the violation. Doesn't undo that this was done to me. Doesn't restore every function and supporting structure. And the fact I can't remember it creeps me the fuck out. I have so many fucking questions I'd like to ask that piece of shit doctor. He's another fucker I'd love to torture like Kelsey and my parents. But I hate society, too. It's partly society's fault that this was done to me, so fuck everyone. Society is why this “procedure” is done in the first place, so it's society's fault that I'm “living” feeling hurt, raped, and humiliated day in and day out. Every time I go to pee. Every time I go to masturbate. Every time I feel my glans chafe. Fuck, I hate my body! I can't escape the feelings of incompleteness and humiliation, and I can still feel Kelsey there touching me and changing me from the innocent boy I once was to the son of a bitch I am now. I would like nothing more than to have a different body. Or to have never been born at all for that matter.

Most people will defend the subhuman monster who molested me and defend the fact I was mutilated without my consent, so when I look out on this world, you know what I see? I see Kelsey everywhere I look. People who don't give two shits about consent. I tried being a soft misanthrope, but now I'm the real deal. I fucking hate humans. The way they look makes me sick. The sound of their voices is nails on a chalkboard. I want to kill myself every day just so I can get rid of everyone. Fuck everyone. Fuck society. I don't want to live another day in this shit world. Now, I know with what I've written that you must be thinking this is some insane mass shooter's manifesto, but that's not the case. I'm smart enough to know there are angels out there. I'm not that much of a loser. But everyone still looks like Kelsey to me. I have to assume they'll ridicule or dismiss me if I were to tell them these things, because history has shown me that most will. I can't stand anymore arrogant indifference and ridicule. I can only discover whether someone is an angel or not by talking to them, but why would I bother when they disgust me from afar? Maybe they are a beautiful angel buried beneath my projection, but who cares? I used to crave friendship, camaraderie, a girlfriend, and romance. I don't anymore. I'm fine all alone. What can anyone else give me I can't give myself? Ridicule? The sight of humans disgusts me, the sound of their voices grates on my ears, and a lot of them are razor blades if you get too close. I'm out of patience, and I have been liberated from having hope. If the nuclear apocalypse came tomorrow and killed everyone, I wouldn't really care. I've heard people say what's stopping them from killing themselves is the fear of hurting someone near and dear to them. That's not me at all. I realized quickly that because you can exploit other people's love to hurt them, I could get revenge on my parents for their role in making me hate my body by killing myself and leaving behind a little spiteful suicide note. If someone misses me when I'm gone, good. Fuck them. So few ever offered compassion, let alone tried to understand, and the silence has been deafening my whole life, so I hope it hurts. Finally, some peace and quiet, liberated from the body I hate. But really, that's not what I want. I don't want to give in to this piece of shit world. I have big dreams, aspirations, and I don't want the fuckers all around me to stop me from achieving them. The way I see it, if I kill myself I just give more power to Kelsey and to my parents and to the doctor. Fuck that. What I want is to stand tall after having achieved my dreams and regenerated my foreskin and raise a middle finger to this whole goddamn world. Still, though, the other option is really appealing sometimes. I've also read that for many parents, being disowned by your own child can be a more painful experience than having said child die. Not gonna lie, vengeance is part of what's pushing these feet forward. I want to see the look on their stupid faces when I tell them the truth. I don't want psychiatric help. It might pacify my colossal rage and the hate I have for my body, but fuck that. It's not a sign of health to be well adjusted to an immensely sick world. My feelings are completely reasonable. I'm not insane. Everyone else is. I wish none of this had happened. I wish I could have back the good person I once was instead of the son of a bitch I am now. But you and I can't meet him because he's fucking dead. He was murdered. Everyone else pissed on his grave. His tombstone reads, “Just wanted you to love him the way he loved you.” Thanks for ruining my life."

I'm trapped until I'm 26.,"Greetings...

I'm a 20 year old American still living with my parents and working as a cashier at a dollar store. No matter my grades in school, this is what it's come too. Unfortunately this is as far as I can really go right now.

Let me summarize my life, this might take a while.

I live in a crowded house still with my parents. Since as long as I can remember we've always lived with at least one of my step-siblings and their children. This is possible because my stepfather is a dozen years older than my mom. Currently it's my parents, my oldest sister and her three kids, and my younger brothers and I. Since we all have crap jobs we're struggling. I give half of my $8 an hour cashier wage to savings, and the other to bills. The food pantry really helps us out.

Even though I'm twenty, I can't drive. This makes me the go-to babysitter so I can't leave the house to practice driving anyway. The few occasions where I get to use my permit my mom gets so nervous that she decides to drive or has someone else drive. I'm isolated, and lonely, so the internet is my only escape. I don't even want to date because of my situation.

Debt is hurting a few of my siblings, and that scared me away from college for a year. Now that I want to go, I can't because I'm still on my parents taxes and my mom is scared of filling out the tax information for my FASFA. I don't know how, but the questions make her feel stupid and she literally yells at the screen when I try to get her help. My dad is usually busy with work because of how our schedules work, or whatever other excuse they can come up with.

I think I've become too useful and my parents secretly won't let me leave. I tried to point it out to them and they pulled every guilt card they could get away with. They won't let me leave, and most of my other family is across the country so I have nowhere to go.

Given that I can't drive, and don't have any education other than a diploma, I'm nearly unhireable, unemployable. I can't get a job that pays living wages to get me out of here.

I'm trapped as a permanent babysitter until I'm twenty six when I don't need my parents to file a fasfa and get scholarships. I can only get crap jobs that I can walk too in case my parents think I'm becoming too independent. I can't leave, I'm trapped here, with no friends, feeling depressed, and have no escape.

And that, my dearest hominids is what's bothering me. I'm all ears if you have any advice on escaping my parents, getting a real job, and getting around without a car. I think I might take my savings one day, pack up, and leave before they can stop me, but I just barely got a couple hundred in my savings though."
I am afraid of the future,I am so afraid of the future. I just feel like I am never going to be able to make my dreams come true. It looks like I'll be someone else living a worthless life. I wanna make things different but it just gets harder and harder. 
I am unemployed but i don't look for a job.,"I am currently unemployed since seven months. I have quited my last job in a fast food who was slowly killing my mental health. I hated waking up everyday for earning my money in a job I hated, so i started attending a coding bootcamp that I finished four months ago.

During Summer, I was telling myself that I needed some real vacations and to enjoy time with my friends.

I was supposed to restart searching jobs in September, but I didn't send more than maybe 10 resumes in two months.

Instead, I just routinely play video games and read books and fuck around being useless to society.

I do nothing and I am so tired, I don't know why.  I don't do anything productive with my time, I don't code or improve my skills, I don't help people with volunteering, but I dread to feel myself trapped and miserable and unworthy again.

I know it is not sustainable, that the money will run short, but this fact don't do anything  to ""wake"" me.

Edit: Spelling mistakes."
My dreams are slowly fading away and I feel worthless,"First of all I´m trully sorry for any mistakes I make but my english isn´t that great and my vocabulary is quiet limited. Second of all I´m not sure if this is posted in the right place for I´m new to this thing.  


A little background-> I´m 21 and I live in small country in central Europe. I´m currently finishing 3rd year at the university. I´m studying rescue services (Mostly firefighting). I come from broken family, spent most of the years living with my mother and sister who I grew to hate after certain thing that happened. For past 2-3 year, I´m not that sure how long it was, I have lived with my father who I have a complicated relationship with. I overthink a lot, I love to help people and I´m trying my best to be as friendly as possible.  


For most of my life I dreamed about playing music, being an artist and I wanted to be important, to be somehow special. I started playing violin when I was 7 tho I left it a year earlier to play accordion because I felt like violin was just not for me. I played accordion for 4 years however I dropped it too after my classmates ridiculed me for it. I went some years without music afterwards. I tried to get more into writing which I was interested in since I was 8-9 years old and I tried to paint a little. I got back to music when I was 15. I started playing guitar tho I mostly learned to play by myself. Later I started playing cello which I fell in love with. I played for 2 years and was told that I could go to conservatoire and learn more.   
That was one of the most important point in my life. I had to pick where to go next. I could either go to conservatoire and study music which I loved however I would probably struggle to make money afterwards, or I could go to the university and study rescue services which could land me a well paid job. From what I wrote earlier you already know what was my choice. I went to the university and after 3 years I´m still unsure wheter I made the right choice. Back then I had a girlfriend. By the time I had to pick one of the choices we were together for roughly 6 months. She was my first girlfriend and since one of my biggest dreams was to be like my granfather who had only one girl throughout his whole life I believed I will be with that girl forever (I know, I was too naive). Because of that and because I wanted to have a family in one point of my life I chose uni because I thought I will have to be able to provide for the family thus I´d need a well paid job. After choosing the school I had to stop playing cello and for past 2 years I only played around 8 times which breaks my heart.  
First dream that got crushed was having her by my side. Everything between us ended around 2 weeks before our first aniversary and I had a mental brakedown.   
Second dream, dream of having at least some good relationships with my family was torn apart when my mother killed my dog because she didn´t want to care of her. That dog was the only thing keeping my head together, I latched on her emotionally and that little creature almost got me through the heartbrake and loneliness.

Now to the still doable dreams.  
When I was 18 I finished my first short story and posted it on the internet to find out if my work is worth it. I recieved some praise from strangers, from my literature teacher aswell as she read the 30-page thing and liked it. I was also working on something bigger but I had to pospone it because I felt like I need to practice more. By now I have created some maps, have more than 100 pages of content (creatures,describtions, cultures, etc.) in encyclopedia that describes world I set my stories in. I have finished a book of 258 A5 pages where I practiced working with particular elements needed in main storyline of that world. I wrote several poems, songs and short stories that I used to get some stuff off my chest. However, most of these things were seen only by me. My family doesn´t care about any of this, most of my friends don´t care either (1 person corrects my mistakes occasionally, she helped to better my style and grammar which rocketed my skill in writing, 2 people occasionally ask me if I have something finished and if they could read it). I have a hard time getting into writing because sometimes when I start writing I just feel as if it was useless and my head is screaming ""why do you waste your time"" at me. I love writing but I feel as if it was useless as if it didn´t have any meaning at all.  
My second big dream was to leave my home country and run out to the world. I wanted to study in Canada or New Zealand but I´d have to have a lot of money for that which I don´t have and I surely will never ask my family for it, neither anyone else cause it´s against my rules. However I don´t really have an opportunity to save enough money either. I worked, I tried some things that could get me some money from the state but was declined. As far as I look at it from any angle there is, I´m going to be stuck at my hometown for my whole life and I have hard times trying to cope with that thought.

Lastly, one of my biggest dreams is to be a father and to have a happy family for the rest of my life. I want to be a good father and even tho I´m scared of that I´ll do anything I can so that my children could be proud of their father. I want to sort of undo all that crap I went through because of my family by raising kids the ""proper"" way. However for past 3 years I couldn´t feel anything at all, not to mention anything even close to love. I was unable to create a romantic relationship in any way. Even tho I can make friends easily and I have a lot of them, even tho I get to know a lot of people and some of them quiet like me, at least one of my friends wanted to be my girlfriend, I was just unable to do anything. I struggle with getting into a relationship. I´m not the best looking pal and I surely have some extra weight but I´m working on it and lost  3 kgs last month without really trying that much, I´m working on it much harder lately.

My life wasn´t that great. I felt lonely for most of it and I was on the edge. I went too far several times when I almost ended it but I managed to pull it through and pledged myself to never even think about it again. I try to just run through all the hard things but I feel as if I was just drifting in life without any purpose. That is what´s bothering me. I feel useless, unwanted, worthless and these feelings keep coming everytime I´m left alone for a moment.  


Anyway, thanks for reading this short story of a scribe. I hope you´ll have a nice day.

cash register came up short :(,"I’m a college student and work at a fast food restaurant just for the summer. This morning when I started my shift I was put on a register already logged in under my name and was taking orders as usual. About an hour in, I coincidentally overheard one of the managers tell another manager about how some people were missing a certain amount of cash from their till. My name was mentioned and I caught one of them say “[idroppedmycroissant] is not like that.” However, a few minutes after, they awkwardly came over, asked me to go handle non-register tasks, and signed me out of my register for the day. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but they seemed to look at me differently too.

There’s always a camera on the registers and I always make sure to count my change carefully before giving it back to a customer. I’m sure I’ve made a few minor mistakes during rush hours, but it can’t be anywhere near the amount that’s missing since it’s a big enough amount that they no longer wanted me on register for the day. I was so worried and hurt that they would think I’m stealing and now I’m feeling great anxiety over this. I want to go to my GM tomorrow and tell her what I overheard and try to clear up the situation, and maybe request that if I’m put on register again, no one uses my till when I’m not there. Multiple people often share a register under someone else’s names during the day and most of the time I use registers under a manager’s name, and I’m sure they aren’t missing anything so why is it that my till, the one that i don’t use very often, has this issue?

I don’t know how to go about addressing it and it’s eating me up right now :( it doesn’t help that I’m soft spoken and introverted, just thinking about bringing this up with my GM is causing me so much anxiety.

Should I go confront the situation? Or wait until someone addresses me? What should I say? I feel so bad about this.

It really hurt me to think that people would think I’m shady and would lose their trust in me when I’ve done nothing wrong ;—; I like my coworkers a lot and I enjoy my shifts (usually). The reason I got this job in the first place was because my mom didn’t want me sitting around the house .__. 

I just feel so bad and can’t sleep rn because of this ;_;"
I can't feel love.,"I don't think I'm capable of feeling love. What's it feel like? How do you know if someone loves you?

I'm not a mean person, I help others when I can, but because of what I went through as a kid (I'm 55 now) I think I stopped feeling love. I'm gay, and I've been through a lot just because of that. I truly love others, but I don't think I've *felt* love in 30 years or so.

I'm not saying ""nobody loves me."" They do. They say it to me. I just don't feel it. I'm numb. 

I've always had to take care of myself. My family has always been ""hot and cold"" toward me because of my gayness so I could never depend on them for solid support.

So, what does love feel like? How do I recognize it? "
My mum is getting shit at work and it makes me really sad to hear anyone treat my mum that way.,"My mum isn’t the best at defending herself and the people at her workplace seem to be bullying her relentlessly. She’s feeling depressed and is overworked, the tremendous amount of stress she’s under is only exacerbating her medical condition. My mum is different from people at work in personality, temperament, and culture, and it makes me sad to think she’s not fitting in with her co-workers. It makes me angry too, her workplace sounds like an immature highschool drama!"

Watching old home videos,"After recently moving, I am staying at my parents while they are away so I can take care of my dog. I found some old home movies of myself and I couldn't help but to watch. And seeing my family 20-25 years ago was awesome and funny and heartwarming. And, not to brag, but I was a cutie. But, as I watched, I couldn't help but feel a bit melancholy. I was a bubbly, whimsical and hilarious kid. I had an infectious laugh and smile. I always had a smile or look of wonder. I was a strange bird and I didn't give a shit. Just an example, for my 6th birthday party I had a costume party since my birthday is Halloween. All the other girls i invited were princesses, fairies or ballerinas and I...was a bug. I was a happy little girl. And now I am 24 and just...not. Somewhere down the road I lost my sense of wonder. My confidence. My joy. My optimism. My love of life. My laugh and smile. And worse of all, I lost my happiness. I realized just how unhappy I've become in my adult years and I am motivated to change that. I don't know how, but I'm going to get that happiness and joy back. That little girl I saw in the videos would be heart broken if she knew she would grow up to be so depressed and pessimistic. I don't want to spend the rest of my life accepting how I am now. Sorry for the long post. It was an emotional rollercoaster seeing my younger self.  "
My register at work was $29 short,"So  I have been working at mcdonalds for the past month and on Sunday, I was having a great shift, but towards the end of my shift my manager tells me my register came up short. I have anxiety, and this is making my mind go to some dark places. Help."
I cut 1 corner and jeopardized my future,"I've been in a program to commission as an officer for my entire college career. We've never had a drug test before, so I thought over the winter break I could get away with a little fun. I was wrong. 

My luck, we had our first test. And apparently I didn't give enough time. It all sucks so much, knowing I didn't hurt anyone or steal anything and still, it all being my fault, for not following a rule no matter how stupid it is. 

Now I am going to get kicked out. Just because I dropped the ball one time. I can't get over this honestly. It's been a month since I found out and I am just barely functioning - getting terrible grades and unable to do anything beyond that and drinking. 

Life feels like it is over for me because I cannot think of a career path that'd be nearly as rewarding for my likes - traveling and career versatility (doing different jobs like foreign affairs or logistics, etc.). 
I remain optimistic that eventually I can find something that'll be as rewarding...but with the amount of time it'll take...it's hard to stay focused and enjoy the present.  "
Trying to get my life moving where I want and my mom isn't helping,"I'm an engineering major who wants to work in renewables(perfect timing, I know). I'm job hunting right now and it's got me really down for various reasons. A bit of backstory before I get into what's happening now.

---

I had a summer internship after my junior year of college (the company was cool, but I wasn't a fan of the field or the location). I did well and they were enthusiastic about hiring me after I graduated. When I visited them over winter break though they couldn't offer me a job for financial reasons (they later did almost a year after I graduated). Since working for them after I graduated was my plan, I was kind of screwed (for those not in a STEM field, if you don't have a job lined up before your second semester senior year you're pretty SOL since all the summer hiring is done in the fall, at least where I went to school).

So I graduated and went job hunting in a state I didn't particularly like but it was where my ""contacts"" were. I didn't like any of the jobs I applied to and I was getting less help than I'd hoped. So after two months I didn't get any interviews and decided to go to grad school and get my MS while doing research. It went pretty well and I finally got an idea of what I wanted to do with my life, so I decided to stay at the university after I finished to get my PhD.

I thought my new project was going to be great. It was working with renewables, which is what I always wanted, but it pretty quickly turned out to be not what I expected. The machine I worked with was built in a rented out space in a metal shop (loud noises, no heating/AC, lots of smoke; all of which don't do well my my anxiety) and my main coworker didn't get along with anyone (myself included). I felt unimportant; the research was co-oped with a company, and they already had a company man doing this before I got on, so I wasn't exactly making any contributions another person couldn't make, and my coworker constantly make me feel inadequate. I fell into depression (for the second time in my life) and tried to get off the project the summer after my first year. My adviser asked me to give him some time to try and fix some problems, so I did, but things didn't get much better. A few months later I started feeling suicidal and brought up getting off the project again. Then it got dropped on me that I couldn't switch to a new project in the group and basically had 4 options:

1) Stay on the project.

2) Leave the group and join another professors group.

3) Leave the university and go to another one.

4) Leave graduate school and find a job.

I ended up going deciding to leave graduate school. Joining a research group after leaving another one creates a lot of distrust since your new adviser doesn't know if you'll stick around, and I honestly felt like I needed a break from school. I started job hunting at the end of November and finished up the semester on good terms. I also started getting my depression treated and I'm working on improving the quality of my life and well-being.

---

Which brings me to now. I’m still job hunting and so far I’ve only gotten one positive response to my applications but so far no interviews (the response was today actually; I've gotten very little feedback in general, which I’m trying to take as a good sign). I started looking in just one city and was looking at a few specific job types, but I’ve expanded out to 6 major cities and I’m looking at all relevant jobs.

Now to what’s been bothering me. For those who have been job hunting, you know it’s stressful, especially the waiting. Most of my family, so I thought, was being pretty supportive and understanding of the wait, albeit my parents are even more impatient than me since they haven’t had to hunt for a job since the 80s. My mom especially has been impatient, and has pushed me to start looking at other cities earlier than I needed to. This added onto my anxiety as I had been spending a lot of time reassuring myself that this is what job hunting is like and that it’s normal to not hear back for a while, and my mom was steadily undoing that reassurance.

Turns out my mom isn’t nearly as understanding as I’d thought. I found out that the company I did my internship with had a posting for a position that I could apply for. It was at their new location though, which was in a city I liked even less than where I did my internship. Additionally, it’s very far away from where I want to settle down and nothing I want to really do is happening in that city, so networking is out of the question. Also, the job won’t get me any relevant experience, so when I decide to move on I wouldn’t have anything to show for the two years I'd be stuck there except some income. I’d basically be in the exact same boat I’m in now, except I’ll be out of touch with the job market and my network, and will have wasted 2-3 years in a job that didn't help me move forward. I'm only recently started getting my depression under control and more than anything I don't want to be stuck in another situation I hate.

I made the mistake of telling my mom about the posting though, since she called the day after I saw the posting. She pushed me to try call up the CEO, since he’d probably be very happy to offer me an interview. I said I’d think about.

An hour later I get a call from a friend, whom helped me get my internship. He gave me a lecture about how I need to take any job anyplace I can get one in this market and *city I hate* is where a lot of people are going, even if they don't want to stay there long.

I realized as soon as we started talking what had happened: my mom called him to get him to talk me into applying. I was pretty upset, for obvious reasons and for another I didn’t realize until a few days later (more on that later). The next day my mom texted and asked if I had talked to the CEO, I said I hadn’t and I wasn’t going to apply for the reasons mentioned above; she didn’t respond. 

the day after I get a text from my sister asking about a **job offer I had passed up**. I got pretty angry at that and kinda blew up at my sister (not directing my anger at her thankfully). I explained, much less calmly, to her the reasons I’d told my mom, especially the fact it was a job posting and not an offer. She was understanding, since my mom has been on her lately as well. She was with my mom at the time so she said she’d call me later.

Around this time, I checked the posting again and it was already gone, so at the very least I wouldn’t get anymore crap for not applying. I reasoned that fi it had been taken down so soon after I'd found it, then they likely already had their candidate well before I saw it.

A few hours later, I get a call from my dad. At first we just caught up, but I knew where the conversation was going to head, and sure enough it did. He asked if I’m applying for many places and specifically at *big company in original city I wanted*, whom I’d already given an application. He was genuinely surprised to hear that, and even more so to hear that I wasn’t just looking at that city but at 5 others and I had branched the positions I was applying to (even though we’d talked before about all this). He then says that he talked to my mom (surprise surprise)(side note, they divorced 7 years ago and rarely talk; they both live in different states, my mom in the same one where the position was) and she had said I’d **passed up a job offer**. I repeated what I’d said to my sister and mention the post was already gone anyway, probably filled by the time I’d found it. He thinks my mom is getting paranoid over nothing and I’m not at the point yet of taking jobs just because I’m desperate. He said he'd talk to my mom, and I haven't heard back from either of them since.

Later my sister called and we had a pretty supportive conversation. She was there when my mom and dad talked and basically described that she’d told my dad I was “holding out for my dream job in my dream city and wasn’t considering anything else”. I was pretty pissed when I heard her say this, especially when my mom had told me earlier “I know you’re trying”. So basically she lied since apparently she doesn't feel I'm trying and decided to complain to my sister, dad, and friend, giving her own false interpretation of what was going on. 

It was about then I realized why I was really bothered by this. This was basically a repeat of an event from a few years ago. My mom had figured out a secret of mine (non-standard sexual interest, which she learned about by going through my dresser looking for a present for my sister, instead of asking where I'd hid it, and then finding some private sexual items; this was abnormal for her to do, so far as I know) that I’d only told a few very close friends of because it can be easily misunderstood. My mom misunderstood, and decided to tell her own false interpretation of what she found to my sister and my dad. I was pretty pissed off when she did that, since it was a very private matter and instead of confronting me about the fact that she’d invaded my privacy and trying to understand what she'd found, she spread hurtful lies to my family. My sister had a long talk with me about it, afterwards she was okay with it though she definitely didn’t understand, and my dad to this day hasn’t brought it up.

So here I am, realizing that my mom can’t be trusted with any personal details about me and me not trusting her to know what’s happening in my life. As well, I’m also now wondering what else she’s said that’s been a lie and what other details of my life she’s blabbed about to others. I’ve basically decided to keep her out of the loop until I start getting interviews, and even then I’m not sure what to do. This is the second time she’s gone behind my back and said hurtful things about me that weren’t remotely true, and it took me more than a year to stop bearing that grudge the first time. I'm becoming less comfortable about being involved with her.

I've gotten a lot of support from my SO, friends, former colleagues, former professors, my sister, and my dad. But it sucks how much one persons' opinion can make all that seem so much lesser.

**tldr**: I'm recovering from depression, quit my PhD program after a year, and I'm trying to get my career started. Job hunting is slow, just the way it is. My mom is making me feel bad that I don't have any interviews yet and passed up a job posting that, while I had a great chance of getting, probably would have made my depression worse and wouldn't further my career. She told people close to me that I was being lazy and passing up a great job offer, basically ignoring my reasoning. I get reminded of another time my mom invaded my privacy and told hurtful things to my family.

edit: My mom called me a few hours ago. She basically ignored the job posting and what she had said to everyone else; I didn't bring it up either. She asked about generic job hunting stuff and talked about my sister, whom is also going through a big life chance and isn't taking it well, both emotionally speaking and with regards to her preparation. The conversation was just off. It was basically the same thing that happened the last time I had mentioned."
I'm so tired of always being anxious about everything,"While I've never been officially diagnosed with any kind of disorders (I've never gone to get checked) I've always felt socially anxious or just anxious in general. When I was younger I was too afraid to talk to most people and I was so afraid of getting out of my comfort zone.

Now that I'm older I've gotten better in some ways but I still feel anxious. For example, since I work in retail, I used to feel really weird making eye contact with people and I didn't talk as much.

Now I talk a little bit more but I'm still pretty quiet. As for the eye contact, I always try to be as alert as possible when I'm around crowds and I have this weird tick now. Whenever I make eye contact with most people, I just nod my head. I mean it sounds normal but it seems strange somehow. Two co-workers even teased me about it once.

I even used to feel embarrassed by getting in people's way and so I had a hard time bringing attention to it. It may have come off as rude then, I'm not sure. I had anxiety about that too. Nowadays I don't have as much trouble with that, because I always try to suppress that embarrassment.

I even get anxiety over actual tasks like driving or the work I do at my job sometimes. I've developed mechanisms that border on obsessive, or maybe they are obsessive. An example would be checking my work schedule every few hours and every time I get off of work. I would read the hours I worked that day or the next over and over again. I would do it several sets of three in my head.

Stuff like this has really been bothering me for months and I want it all to stop, or at least be minimized. I know I should probably go see some professional help but in the most ironic twist, I have anxiety over that too. Besides I'm not sure if insurance will cover it and I can't afford it out of pocket.

Lately though, I've been noticing something else about myself. I think it bothers me as well, but I'm not sure if I'll post that here. I think this post is long enough. Maybe I'll save it for another one."
I shouldn't have to spend money to have friends,"I'm so fucking tired of having to spend money to hang out with friends. It's always like, hey let's  get some lunch or hey let's get a drink. What do we do afterwards? Nothing!!!! Really i just blew like $20 on food I didn't even want just to leave the house for an hour.

What happened to hanging out at people's houses? My house isn't an option and it seems like EVERYONE i know also comes from some sort of broken home or has a shit ton of family staying with them. I hate this. I wish i had a place to invite my friends over to. I hate not having my own space. 

My social life is crumbling cause I'm tired of spending money. Fuck this overpriced town. I'm socialable, I'm friendly. Why the fuck couldn't i be born into a house that wasn't broken. Why the fuck can't i have the social life i want. 

I mean fuck you're just as lonely as i am. It feels like everyone i meet is just as lonely. ""Oh hey let's hang out outside of class."" And do what???? Neither of our houses are an option, my car is totaled and you don't drive, on top of that you don't work. You're lonely cause you come from a broken home. Everyone i know comes from a broken home. You all feel how i feel but it's like none of us can do anything about it. Fuck this.  

Last week you told me that there was a kickback happenning and i was pumped. Like seriously i love going over to people's houses, having a close knit group of friends just drinking and playing  board games or mario kart. It's cheap, fun, and we're in the comfort of someone's home. BUT NOPE. For some shitty reason those plans got scrapped and now it's just ""oh we're going to get drinks at this bar."" Fuck that. That's not fun. That's expensive and i'm sure it bothers you to on some level. I'm just really fucking pissed that whenever i want to hang out with someone i have to spend money I don't have and no one i know has an open pad. Not one person i know can be like ""hey man come on over."" Fuck this place."
I feel like poeple hang out with me because they feel sorry for me,"I wasn't very popular for the majority of my life. Which is fine, becasue you don't need to be popular to be happy. My problem was that I didn't have any friends until high school, when I moved districts. I did have one friend in middle school. Until one day he stopped talking to me. One minute we were pals, and the next thing I know he didn't say anything to me for 3 years (6-8th grade)(This happened to me again in highschool, but that is a different story for a different time). Because of this loss I spent many a lunches eating by myself in the middle of the cafeteria, and many weekends in my home playing video games while everybody else hung out and did the usual kid stuff. 

When I moved to high shcool, things brightened up a little for me. Although I drifted between 3 groups of friends, I finally found one group that (I hoped) liked me for who I was. High school passed and we are all currently in college. I still talk with them at least 2-3 days a week throiugh Skype which is cool I guess. Three of them go to the same college so they see each other often. I usually call them and they only answer when they have nothing else to do. 

I have two friends in college. One is somebody that I met on my floor last year(who lives off campus now) and the other from a class that we were in (he lives a floor above me). I'm in a single room and don't see much of them anymore. The one who lives off campus, I have to ask if he would like to do something. Half the time he's busy or doing things with other friends. When we fist met it was great. We could talk for hours and never get bored. This year we talked for 10-20 minutes before I felt like I didn't have anything more to say. The last two times I saw him though, he told me that I was giving him a headache because I was talking too much. That really hurt. I was making somebody physically sick just because of my presence. I don't want to paint him as a bad guy because he's not. He's the most amazing person I've met, but have I been pushing it too much? I've told myself that I wouldn't invite him to do anything until he contacted me first. I saw this as a way to make sure that he's ready to do stuff again, because I felt like I push him too much to do things. I've told him that I don't really hang out with anybody else and he said to go out and ""get some more friends""(he said this in a joking manner, but it still rings true). Anyways, I'm apporaching three weeks of no contact. Not a text, snapchat, nothing.  I feel like this is my fault for being such a loser. I'm expecting this one dude to be my only friend when he has his own life and agenda, but I still want the attention. I feel like whenever I offer to do something, he's saying yes just because he feels sorry for me. He knows that I don't really have anybody else, and he just puts on a show because I've spent so much time with him and revealed so much of my personal thoughts. Like he owes me or something. 

The other firend is a different case. He also doesn't really have lots of friends. Despite living above me I see him once a week, tops. I tell him he can come over whenever he likes but he only come over for like 2 hours a week. At least I don't have to invite him down, he'll just come down himself. I feel like this is a similiar situation though. He comes down because I've known him for a year and he doesn't have anybody better to hang with. I'm just a placeholder until he finds somebody better. He's very good at talking to almost anybody, I'm amazed that he hasn't found anybody better yet. (Still not trying to make him look bad, as he is also amazing and I respect him very much.) 

As said before I'm in a single room so I don't have a roomate. My floor is very isolated. Nobody leaves their doors open and my RA is never to be found. I've gone to some callouts, however they only meet twice a month, so I don't know if I could make any long lasting relationships from that. I've thought about talking to a prefessional for this problem(and some minor other issues), but I feel like they wouldn't really care. They're paid to listen to people talk about their problems, why would they even care about mine? I feel like my childhood made me distrust people, like anybody would suddenly stop talking to me for no reason. 

Thank you for reading. This was about triple the length I wanted it to be. I've been a fan of this sub since the beginning and all of you are amazing people.                 "
I've lost all motivation and can't find reason within myself to keep trying.,"Sadly I made a throwaway account with such a cool name.


Anyways, I'm 20 and I feel like I've lost sense of direction in my life. I'm currently attending community college but I'm really only going for my parents (I'd get kicked out if I didn't). I've had a really hard time motivating myself to get anything done and have been smoking weed to really help me work (clears my mind and allows me to intensely focus, although it varies by strain). Me and my girlfriend have been in turmoil for the past 2 months and it's definitely over and I've come to terms with it. I don't think that's really the sole cause of the way I feel, but I've mostly just had a shift in the way I view the world from exploring philosophical ideas and alot has been troubling me.

I feel like I'm at a crossroad in my life and I must choose the life I want, but I don't know what I want. I use to want to be creative and create videos and what not, but not I help run a wedding videography company and I just don't do any creative stuff outside of editing wedding videos. Even then I feel like I'm half-assing my job. I can really only say I have 1 friend and close coworkers but they're not the type I'd open up to.

I find myself disinterested with life, and I find myself asking myself ""is this it"" more and more often.

Sorry for rambling and I hope I didn't come off as an angsty 20 year old... heres a summary


**TL;DR - I'm overall just confused with what to do with my life**"
I'm being sensitive.,"Please bear with me, and allow me to give some background.

For the last 3 1/2 years, I've been an absolute hermit. I only speak to my husband, brother, and parents. I only leave the house to see my doctors or to get blood work done. Starting a few weeks ago, I was finally at a point where I thought I could engage the world.

Well, I forgot how inhospitable Reddit can be. I posted a video that actually happened (I witnessed it live on Twitch earlier in the week). Well, my brother and husband upvoted me for support (yay), but then I got downvoted and accused of submitting fake videos. It felt really good to be excited about sharing something with people outside of my family, but then that feeling turned sour as I realized I will probably never get acknowledgement of my existence from others (or of my input to others). It shouldn't matter, but it does. That thought hurts.

I know I'm overreacting, but after nearly 4 years of loneliness, I was ready for some positive human interaction. "
I'm scared that torrenting has caught up to me.,"I used to torrent games like demos. I would download the game, try it, and if I really liked it, I'd buy the game. If I didn't like it, I'd uninstall it and move on. 

I downloaded a game about a month ago, and played it. I didn't like it, but I forgot to delete it, and it was still seeding, and sitting on my computer. 

I left home about a week and a half ago on a road trip, and apparently, yesterday, my dad was called by Penn and Teller Data, and they shut my Internet down for twenty four hours. I'm not home. I'm scared. I had my brother uninstall uTorrent and all things off of all the computers in the house, but I'm still very very scared that something is going to happen, and I'm not there to do anything about it. Someone please either ease my mind, or tell me I'm fucked, because I'm so scared. "
I enjoy pretending to be a girl online,"Sorry if this is isn't suited for this sub, I didn't know where else to post this. 

Warning: may be sorta NSFW


For reasons I'm still unsure of, I really like pretending to be a girl online. One thing I particularly enjoy is erping with guys (erotic role playing) and pretending to be a young girl. I feel accomplished making them achieve orgasm. The thing that I don't understand is, I am in no way attracted to men. 

I'm not sure what I'm hoping to accomplish by posting this here, just thought I needed someone to hear it, I suppose."
Rebuilding after depression.,"Tl;Dr: I am finally no longer severely/suicidally depressed, but now I'm hardly capable of being social,  even with my closest and oldest friends. I was more talkative, fun, and open when I was depressed. I don't know how to talk to people anymore, nor do I remember how to be those things again.


I've been a depressed for years- sparked by an existential crisis and botched suicide attempt in grade 9- and within those years of chronic depression I was lively and didn't give two shits about anything. I could talk to anyone about anything because I was **out there** , masked by not giving a shit, burying my pain in comedy, ala the clown of the group (being alone at home was a totally different experience) It wasn't healthy, but it gave me a close circle of people who cared about me for what I was, because they experienced the depths of depression themselves. 

I eventually even started to love a girl who was just as crazy as me, but disaster struck home. One of the closest people to me, my best friend for all intensive purposes, took her life last year.

I *shut down*. 

That lively, depressed, jovial asshole, people loved and hated loving, instantaneously transformed into your classic depressive cynic. A textbook troglodyte terrorizing my truest companions. There was no mask, no joking, no smiling. I stopped laughing. Stopped caring in the slightest,  and if you did anything that agitated(regardless if you meant to or not) me you'd end up unjustly roasted by verbal hellfire. Imagine Carlin attacking every member of his audience. 

I got with that crazy girl of my dreams at the worst possible time (a month after the death) and spiraled from there into the darkest depressive stupor I've yet survived.  

I lost the girl of my dreams, but it kinda didn't even matter because I was going to take hangmans exit anyway, until I saw how she looked at me. I've never had another, especially someone I loved, look at me exactly how I felt. 

It shattered me.

 I was confused and fighting myself, and once my mind was under my control I stepped up and cleaned house. Within the last 5 months the depression seemingly drifted away, of course I still get sad and weird sometimes, but I can handle it. 

Except.... I can't talk to anyone. I don't know how to be jovial. The part of me that could be friends with anyone and could talk for hours on end about everything appears to be buried with my friend. That crazy girl who is still of my dreams I cannot speak to for more than a few messages. I can't talk to my closest friends, I don't know how to talk to anyone anymore.

I am finally no longer severely/suicidally depressed, but now I'm hardly capable of being social,  even with my closest and oldest friends. Sure I know much of them, but that didn't stop me before.. I was more talkative, fun, and open when I was regularly depressed. I don't know how to talk to people anymore, nor do I remember how to be those things again. I don't even remember much of the last year, which saddens me greatly. I look in the mirror and see a stranger of whom I admire little.

Any advice?"
I feel like I'm tottering on the edge of the abyss(Long),"Probably for about the past 6 months, I feel like I've been on the edge of falling into depression. With being a senior in high school, it feels like nothing matters anymore, yet I'm still stressed about everything. I've got a shit load of AP tests in a month, that I've barely studied for. The only college I got into that I actually want to go to is Rose Hulman, which is actually a good school... But it's so hard to be raised to think that maybe my friends and I are special. I've always been in the top of my class, taking all advanced classes, doing plenty of extracurriculars, and overall having extremely high hopes for my future. And now I realize that it's nothing special. There are literally millions of other people exactly like me, sure we'll do alright in life and get a nice college degree. We'll probably live a pretty nice life. But I'm never going to do something in the world. I'm just me. I couldn't even get into one of my top choice schools, there's no chance I'm going to be able to do anything big going to a school only well known in the Midwest.

And still, that's not even all that's on my plate right now. I'm just so lonely. I have plenty of friends at school, and we hang out a lot, but literally none of them actually know me. They don't know my feelings, my passions, my insecurities. To them, I'm an emotionless video game nerd. It doesn't help that for the past three years I've had very strong romantic feelings (I don't want to say love, considering I'm a high schooler) for one of my very good friends... Who has been dating another very good friend since 8th grade. She's actually one of my closest friends, and I know she likes me a lot--as a friend--and that just makes it so much harder. Being close to her, being someone she can talk to, hanging out on weekends, it just hurts emotionally so badly. 

I've gotten to the point where I'm almost becoming emotionally numb, and that's honestly one of the scariest things right now because I know it's happening. The fun I have with my friends is deadened by the pain of being around her and her boyfriend as well as practically being the 9th wheel considering all of my friends are dating each other. The only happiness I've been able to find recently has been through video games and tv shows.

I don't know why I'm typing this out, I guess I just needed to vent. I don't really have anyone in my life I could tell this too without feeling like an idiot, and I know that's bad. Really right now I'm just hoping that once I go to college I'll be able to move on. Thanks for reading."
Can you really be friends with an ex?,"My very first relationship ended two weeks ago. It was mutual and I'm not too upset about it. Too much distance and emotional drift wasn't making their depression and my suspected depression any better. I've been working through it and im mostly covered in regards to emotional recovery and growth. There's a promise of friendship and a restart in the distant future but i'm wondering if it's possible to really be friends again. I'm not counting on becoming a couple again and currently have no interest of doing so. I do miss having them around to talk about random things but i've been trying to give them some space and not contacting them at all. I'm just writing here mostly for validation and some kind of permission or time frame where i can start talking to them again. I know i can talk to them whenever but in general, what is a good amount of no contact? Also if anyone had self books for communication or self-care to recommend would be awesome and greatly appreciated."
I just wanted to tell a story to you guys.,"So on a throwaway, I had posted on this subreddit about some issues I was struggling with. I had first gone to family, friends, and church. At the time I had felt like I was interrupting people's days, and was just being selfish and petty. 

I have since gotten past the issues that I had originally posted. The responses that I received were just the encouragement that I needed to keep on trucking, and keep on moving forward. So to all of you responders, I wanted to say thank you. You're truly helping people.

I don't want to be alive anymore.,"I have nothing left. My goals and aspirations have evaporated. They don't mean shit anymore. My entire world has fallen apart. I don't want to keep going. I'm going to because I have to, but I don't want to. I'm done."
Fuck you chemistry.,"I was a 4.0 student in school up until the second semester of my senior year. Ever since then I've been a lazy slob and every part of me doesn't want to be anymore. I came to college this semester as a freshman and was pretty much drunk for the first two months. I've tried so hard to get back to my hard working self. I joined hall council and student government. I volunteer for around four hours every Friday. I am part of an organization that matches foreign exchange students with English speaking students who help them with their English.

Due to partying too much early in the semester my grades were not something I was proud of. I've been working hard to get my grades up. Every class is up at least 1 whole letter grade except for fucking chemistry. I finally have my work ethic back, the only thing I'll ever be proud of. But turns out I naturally suck at chemistry. I've always thought anyone can learn anything if they put enough time and smart effort into it. But this class is testing that philosophy to the limit. I know I can do it, but I just seeing the uphill battle ahead of me is pretty disheartening.

I want to go to med school and also be a multicultural advisor at my college but my mistakes this semester seriously make me hate myself just a bit. Fuck me I can be so stupid.

I've decided I won't give up and that I want to do good in this world. I need to spend my time with purpose. So fuck you chemistry I will master your ass if it's the last thing I do. You're the hardest thing I haven't been able to overcome within a month and I will master you.

My message for you is to go master your own chemistry. That is all.

Also if you have any advice when it comes to studying the sciences I would appreciate it."

Hooked up after a ball I invited her to. Got her sick. She's incredibly busy but she agreed to clear her entire day one day so we could hang out all day. But she got mad at me for getting her sick/was resting so that was scrapped. 

I was somewhat annoyed and went out to a party and ended up hooking up with a random girl. She gave me a hickey.

Next day I see my girl and she sees the hickey. She texts me later asking about it and I just fudge around with her about it because she said it is no big deal.

So I keep inviting her to hang out and she keeps on flaking or saying she can't. 

Finally after telling her I like her for her personality etc. etc. (like after a month of flakes) she FINALLY gives me the time of day and we hang out for an hour or so. 

At this point it is finals time and we try but fail to hang out. 

Over the summer we text some and we both like adventure so we agree on me driving all the way to her house, 2 hours away, sneaking into her house on a Thursday. (Her family was going to be gone the next morning, for the weekend)

So we do that, smoke weed the next morning, and end up hooking up some. I get her out of her shirt/bra and start fingering her but she starts giving all these reasons why we shouldn't go further. So after some persistence, I give up and the day goes on rather normally. We hangout with her friends and they all did crazy ass drugs while I drove 'em around. 

Then around 9 PM she goes across her yard and starts talking with a couple of her girl friends...next thing I know she tells me she doesn't feel comfortable staying with me the weekend and is going to sleep at her friend's house...she says I didn't cross any boundaries with the hooking up and she just realized that she didn't feel comfortable spending the entire weekend with someone she doesn't know really, really well...

I act calm and collected and actually stick around for a bit before she brings up that she is surprised I stuck around and a switch flipped in me and I basically said ""you know what, I should leave."" and leave. She is saying sorry and all this crap whilst this is going on and I just say ""actions speak louder than words"" and she leaves me in my car in the garage all upset. 

She texts me apologizing again. I don't answer her for a week or so before deciding that maybe I was also in the wrong. We had only hung out 10 times and considering the sluttiness I already exuded she probably felt like I was just another conquest to her and she herself felt like a slut. 

So in comes the next semester. She flakes or can't hang out with me again and again and again. I finally tell her I like her and all but if she isn't going to make the time for me to hang out or if she doesn't even like me then don't even bother texting me. 

So she says she'll make time. We hang out. Everything seems pretty good in our little world.

Eventually things go to shit as they always do. She was telling me how she was on tinder just for when she was bored to talk to guys so I felt no problem going on tinder too. She texts me saying her friend saw me on tinder and she was happy to be in one of my pictures...so I just say how I don't want to be on tinder and that's because I like you but I never see you. She goes on to say she doesn't wanna lead me on and she isn't sure whether she likes me and thinks she would by now and all this bullshit. I couldn't believe it. So I get all sappy and smooth and try to get her to give me one more chance and that I know she liked me in the past and needs to look past the whole hickey issue and all because we clicked in the past. She ignores all of my emotional opening up just to say ""hahaha ___"" ___ being some random anecdote I mentioned in my text. 

I don't text shit after that. 

Then I bought pot brownies from a guy she knows about a week later and for whatever reason she decides she needs to text me to let me know to only take half a brownie because they are really strong. I ignore of course.

And she has been snapchatting me ever since. Everyday. 

So I feel like shit and can't get her off my mind. I feel like I fucked up by making her feel like a slut and she also probably associates me with bad feelings because she decided to kick me out of her house (she said that was the worst thing she has ever done to anyone...). 

But things are more complicated than that as it doesn't even make sense that she was mad at me for the hickey crap...she was actively hooking up with a dude whom she apparently ""really liked""...though I do imagine she means moreso the way I treated the situation by fudging around/beating around the bush. 

So I don't know. I want her bad. I find her adorable...we click at an extrinsic level...I feel like we'd have a good thing going if she ever gave me a real chance. But maybe she is a bitch like all my friends, guys and girls, say and I should just move on...but my heart doesn't want me to. 

Thank you for reading and even more so if you let me know wat do. 

My birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks so what I THINK I should do is just see what she does...I am hoping she texts me and I can then say ""we should talk in person"" and mention that I am frustrated that she's overlooking the great times we had before the hickey incident and that I am upset at myself for being such a jerkoff and I acknowledge that my actions made her feel like a slut and a dirtbag. But if she gave me that day she promised me way back when, I'd charm the hell out of her, with pizza.

So when are you having kids?,"My wonderful mother-in-law has been so kind to keep asking me for the last two years when I will finally be giving her a grand baby. 

My husband and I married three years ago after I had graduated college. I have an insane amount of student debt and pay over $1200/month just in loans. Because of this, we can't get a house, I can't buy a new vehicle, and for the love of god I can't afford a kid. My husband knew this going into it. He's super supportive. I love him very much. 

But today I finally snapped. I told my MIL that she will not be getting any grandkids out of me anytime soon and she better get used to the idea. A child would be wonderful. Yes I want to carry a baby and bring it into this world and love it but it is not an option at this point. A child, at this point in time, is an expense that we cannot afford. We cannot give it its own room. And I've seen the prices of diapers alone and there is no way I could afford those on top of everything else. So I have to tell my baby-hungry-uterus no. No babies. Not until the loans come down and the pay goes up. Not until we have a house. Not until we can give it the life it deserves. 

I had her in tears. I feel terrible. Part of me says that she had this coming. Part of me sees the lonely mother whose four babies are all grown up and left her with a big empty house. I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to look her in the eye after this. "
"It seems like my new ""friends"" don't really care about me.","Just moved to a new state and I'm now enrolled in a new school. I've really been trying to connect with people and make new friends. I've met around 10 people I frequently talk to and consider my ""friends"". I treat them exactly how I want to be treated. I ask them open-minded questions to ~~share~~ show I care, comment with jokes/complements/advice on everything they tell me. I try my best to make their life easier and be someone they enjoy talking to. They never ask me about my life though. They don't seem to care about what I have to say. It always seems like I have to do all the work to keep the conversation rolling even after 2 months. I mean I really like to hear their stories but sometimes I think: *what about me?*

I've noticed this a lot. Even on reddit. Back in /r/casualconversation I've asked people about their passions, lives, problems and they never had a problem to answer my questions/comments and talk about themselves. Maybe I'm asking for too much. Maybe I should just spend the rest of my life not having the joy of sharing about myself.



Anyways thanks for reading. I have some questions if you'd like to answer.


Why do people like talking about themselves so much? 


How can I be friends with someone who doesn't ask about me?


Have you ever been a friend to someone who barely asked about your life? 


Have you ever thrown yourself out there and got nothing in return? "
I can't fully trust my girlfriend,"I'm dating a girl for almost three years. It's been a long time, but I still have some difficulties to trust her. She is my first girlfriend and I never did much success with girls, so from time to time feel afraid of not have her with me anymore.

I began to suspect her after seeing a message from her ex-boyfriend, he asked her to send voice messages because he was missing her voice and she sent. I was upset and asked her not to do it anymore, and she accepted. A while later I found out they were texting again. I talked again and then she told me she did not know that this made ​​me so bad.

After these episodes, I feel I can not trust her. I see some other guys texting her, but I do not read, I do not think that's really nice. I've talked about this with her, indirectly. I feel it is wrong to prohibit her to talk to other people, it would be unhealthy. But I feel bad, I'm afraid of being betrayed.

I am a very sincere person and always expect it from others. But do not feel that she is sincere as well.

I rub everyone the wrong way.,"I'm awkward. I'm awkward in person and online. I try so hard to be polite and I let people walk all over me, yet somehow I'm always rude or abrasive or off putting. I don't say a whole lot, I speak only when spoken to, and I'm respectful.

I mean what is really stopping us from going over there and completely and totally wiping the radical elements off the face of the planet forever? Like who in the world would be mad? No one at all. We would be doing the world a favor by cleaning that hell hole of a country cause the civilians don't want them there. Also it makes me angry that they are beheading people for not following their beliefs. Seriously what the actual fuck we are not in the crusades anymore.

"I'm 18 and hilariously bad with girls - yet I get the feeling that I can move forward, I'm just too anxious to do so","I already feel sorry for posting this, as it is quite a cliché story about that German dork that gets along well, but just doesn't has any luck with girls. **If you have something better to do, then please skip this post**; I'm neither depressed nor even remotely suicidal, I don't have problems that could be life-shattering, I just don't have any balls. This is a long story and I don't even know if there is a response out there that could really help me, or whether I just need to man up.

Ah, well, let's start. I'm an 18 year old male from Germany, slightly chubby but pretty normal, who just finished school past month. I guess you could say I'm a stereotypical computer guy - I enjoy working with tech and learning new related things, my room looks like a nerd cove with a multi-monitor setup, a RasPi as media player and a cheap home server tucked under the bed, complimented with a Skyrim map and Anime wallscrolls.

Now, while I don't really get along with most girls that good, guys don't seem to mind. I really wasn't unpopular in school, it's just that my circle of friends consists mostly of males, with a few girls in between that I actually get along with; although those are mostly the kind of girls who prefer male friends.

A good friend of mine kind of hooked me up with a prom date who I'd say was quite a bit above my league, but we got along nicely and she really didn't seem to mind. We started hanging out together, despite her living a ~15min car route away, and this is the point where I don't really know what to do. Most initiative originates from her, like inviting me to her home after grabbing a snack together, showing me funny parts of her diaries or saying that we should go watch a movie at my house tomorrow and then watch the sequel at the movies thereafter. 

As can be guessed from the title, I'm hilariously bad at reading signals, so I really don't know whether she wants to be good friends or maybe more. I'm entirely unsure on how I would find this out without fucking this up good, and I wouldn't know how to handle the situation if she actually would like to be more than friends, seeing that I never entered a serious relationship and don't even know how to kiss.

Considering she actually appears to like my slightly smartass comments from time to time as well as my general attitude, I thought about just asking her, as casual as possible, maybe at the movies. She might handle that better than other girls, seeing as she's not a mobile phone zombie playing hard-to-get like most girls appear to me, but rather straight-forward. It's just that I fear that the situation gets as awkward as possible and she'd refrain from wanting to meet me again, even if it would be on a ""just friends"" base."
"Girlfriend/family buying a house, and its happening really quickly.","[Throwaway account]

Over the past two weeks my girlfriend and her mum have been looking at houses, and they put in an offer on one. I'd love to have a house together, but for a couple reasons its been really stressful. The decision happened really quickly and I feel like I wasn't part of the process - I hadn't even seen the place until after the offer was submitted. They're going to see a lawyer/bank in a couple days, which I only learned about yesterday and can't come to because its during work.

Basically the total down payment will be about 60%, from a small inheritance she has combined with money her family wants to put in. This leaves a 50K mortgage to be paid, which isn't much for a house, but under any other circumstances I don't know if we'd take that kind of debt. We're both working right now and I have ~8.5K in savings, but if one of us lost our jobs or if she went back to school (which she wants to), I honestly don't if we could pay the bills. I've only been working 4 months, myself.

I don't know, it feels weird how quickly its happening, and that I wasn't really part of the process. We never all (us and her parents) sat down to talk about how it'd work, ownership, responsibilities, etc... We're renting right now so I understand that its generally better to put that money into something you own, but it still just doesn't seem thought out. There are renovations that need to be done, and I have no idea what they'll cost or who's paying for them.

We talked about yesterday and she understands we're I'm coming from, but is obviously upset that I'm not all in - and honestly, how could I be? It's only been two weeks since I even heard about it, and we (or at least I) still don't know important basic information about it."
I'm really jealous.,"To cut a long story short and down to the main issue, I'm really jealous of one of my closest friends. I'm jealous of everything he is, has and stands for: his job, his flat, his girlfriend, his looks, his character... I feel really awful and hate myself for it because I'm supposed to feel happy for him doing so well but I'm scared that given the right opportunity at the right moment I would seriously hurt him. He doesn't know. I don't know what to do."
What I've been through the last year or so and what I've done to get over these issues.,"Hello /r/whatsbothering you,

I'm making this post because this subreddit has done a lot for me during a difficult time in my life. I wanted to give a little perspective of myself, what I've been through, how I've overcome the obstacle I've faced, in hope that this may help someone out there. This'll probably be pretty long, so buckle up haha.

I'm going into my third year of undergrad as a biochem premed student and I've always done very well in school, until last semester. Something happened; I wasn't myself, I was stressed, and unmotivated. What I realize now is that it was intense burnout and depression. It was crippling to my relationships with people and my academic career. I was anxious, exhausted, and very depressed. If I could go back, I would tell myself that it was ok to admit that I needed help. This was the biggest barrier for me: fear of my own humanity.

To overcome this horrible empty feeling I tried everything. I tried exercising, learning new talents, trying a new sleep schedule, just working harder, etc. But there was no solution, I felt lost and I felt like I was spiraling into mediocraty, and the worst of it all was my inability to change anything.

So earlier this year I made a change. I've journaled for a long time trying to process my feelings, but when that stopped working I reached out to the counseling service at my school. This was what jump started my road to getting back to my newer, refreshed self, but it took a long time, and that wasn't the only thing that did it for me. The benefit from counseling came from having a person who could sit and talk through your emotions and get passed irrational thinking. Also it gave me insight to the issues in my life aside from academics (i.e. non-ideal family situations).

Along with counseling for a few months I:

* ran as much as I could

* learned guitar

* began reading

* focused on unhealthy habits like staying up too late, not having a consistent sleep schedule, working on stuff in bed, watching netflix in bed (I switched to [radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/) and it helped soooooo much with my sleep).

But it wasn't until recently that I felt like I was back on top and improving myself and from what I can tell it was a combination of these things that got me through a tough time as well as:

* being around and socializing with people

* **Nutrition**, it helped more than you can imagine. Having a balanced diet made me feel so much better and gave me more energy. This really came from cooking for myself and being aware of what I put into my body.

* Choosing something you are passionate about and learning about it (for me it is learning languages, music, and scientific material).

* Making sure to get out of the house.

* Separating my work, rest, and leisure areas and being very strict about it.

* The realization that I have the ability to choose how I feel and I have an active role in making sure I am happy.

* And finally, this is a big/hard one: **not procrastinating**. This is difficult because no one likes to do work, but the farther ahead you work the better education you will get and the more actual free time you have greatly increases.

That's pretty much it. A few other things that have given me inspiration is reading: [Think or Sink](http://www.amazon.com/Think-Sink-Choice-Changes-Everything-ebook/dp/B0036FTN3Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1405607716&sr=1-1&keywords=think+or+sink%3A+the+one), which explains how to actively choose how to think as well as the radio lab segment called [Secrets of Success](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91971-secrets-of-success/), which describes ways to come about success (it's long but worth it!).

Anyways, I've rambled on long enough. Hopefully someone out there finds this helpful, and if not I still want to say thank you to this subreddit. This community has helped me and I will continue to support it when I can.

I feel like I'll never be happy,"I've been depressed my whole life, so I've pretty much grown accustomed to it, but lately it's been worse. 
Small things are starting to annoy me. Some examples are:
2 of my best friends are in a relationship, but when I think about them together, I get aggravated and annoyed. I don't know why. Maybe I'm jealous of what they have, or maybe it's the fact that since they've been dating, they barely give me attention anymore. 
Also, I go back to college in a little over a month, and I have a decent life there. A lot of friends, a girl or 2 I'd like to date, and supportive professors, but I have absolutely no desire to go back. I don't been care about seeing my friends. 

I haven't been happy since.....well I can't remember the last time I was happy. Nothing excites me anymore, and I'm starting to hate people more and more every day. 

I know this might not be as big of a post as some people make, but I just needed to get his out of my head. 

My final words are from a confession bear I saw one time that really spoke to me: ""The only reason I don't kill myself, is because I know how it will negatively affect my family and friends."""
I need some adivce,"Sorry about the vague title.

Some context: I have been considering coming out to my parents for quite some time now. They aren't *against* the LGBTQ community, but it seems like they care a lot about ""who's gay"" and ""who's straight"" (referring to celebrities).

As some of you might know, WorldPride is happening in Toronto this week. I was invited to help build the float for my university, which will be marching in the parade. I messaged my mom about this, and she said she's fine with me building the float but she doesn't want me in the parade, which is this Sunday, because she is ""still a little bit conservative"". She said we would talk more about this tonight.

I was strongly considering coming out this weekend, but that comment just made me question everything. I have been hyperventilating and shaking for the past hour, I don't know what to do. Any advice would be great."
I am an incredibly ungrateful child.,"So, I'm probably a terrible person. I'm 15, and I've been routinely stealing money for my parents, for no better reason other than 'I want sweets' and 'I just want money'. My mother found out, and she came and talked to me the most upset she's ever been. I'm extremely disrespectful to my parents; I ignore them and stay in my room when I come home from school, and I know that I am incredibly up myself in terms of I think I know everything. and the worst thing is, though their parental methods have maybe been a bit harsh (sometimes being gently hit, yelled at a lot), they don't really deserve it. They really do a lot for me, pay money for me to go to an expensive school and go on extra curricular programs and what-not even though my mother revealed that we are apparently not as well off as I believed. 

What I need to know is this:
a) How I can fix my relationship with my parents
b) Stop habitually stealing from them,
c) Generally fix above mentioned personality flaws.

Thanks everyone."
I don't know if I can keep going...,"Hi there. I don't really know who to talk to about this so I thought I'd make a post here...

I feel like my entire life is just a pile of shit, and that nothing I do will ever make it better. It's all I've been able to think about today.

I've been unemployed for months now. No matter how many jobs I apply for, it seems like every resume and every application just disappears into some giant black hole. If I'm lucky, in a month I'll get a generic form email telling me I wasn't chosen for the position. 

Of course, any time I really start thinking about my career options, I am reminded that I have very little in the way of marketable skills. Getting a shitty diploma from a no name college didn't help me at all while leaving me with thousands of dollars of debt. I always end up thinking that I should have gone and learned something useful that would help me get a job, but the more I think of it the less I can think of that I should have done instead...

My family has been quite agitated at my inability to get a job recently, and have basically stopped talking to me. None of my friends live anywhere near me anymore, and while I still get the chance to talk to them online once in a while, it's not really the same as actually seeing them in person.

Every time I see myself in a mirror I just see a worthless disgusting waste of space. I feel like I can never do anything right. I just fail at everything. 

And the worst part of all of this? The worst part is that I can't see it getting any better. I don't see any moving on from here, I can't see it getting better. I don't see my life improving at all in the future, I just see more and more opportunities for things to get worse and worse.

There's a set of railroad tracks about a five minute walk from my apartment. Sometimes I think I should just go over to them in the middle of the night and fall asleep on them. 

I kind of don't want to do it, but every day I find it harder and harder to find a reason to keep going. Sorry for the length of the post. "
I feel like I picked the wrong guy to be my roommate.,"Sooo I put out a Craigslist add for a roommate and there was only one response that seemed normal. So I hung out with him and he seems alright, but I also previously denied my good friend the room because my last roommates were my friends and they fucked me over. Now that its coming down to it, I wish I let my friend have it. :/"
I'm bisexual and I have nobody to talk to about that.,"I'm 22yo male. All my life I have been dating girls. Last night I slept with one guy I met at a party. I've slept with 3 males so far. I'm scared that they will tell someone. My friends don't know about me being bisexual and I think they wouldn't accept that. I know that ""true friends will accept anything"" but not in this case. I have nobody to talk to about my situation and I'm afraid to come out. I don't know what to do. This is a throwaway. Should I tell my friends and risk losing them?"
What's bothering me? I'm lonely and I don't know what to do about it...,"To quote Ned Flanders' dad: ""We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas!""

23/M for context.

I'm lonely, I've never had a meaningful relationship, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to approach women. I don't know how to talk to one I'm even remotely interested in. I can't even do online dating because I get so damn nervous and confused I don't know what to do. Going out and trying to dance or talk with women at a bar or show or whatever just gets met with indifference and/or laughs. 

I've tried. I don't know how many different approach techniques or conversation starters or whatever I've found on Reddit and god knows where else but I can't keep my spaghetti in my pockets long enough to get anything accomplished.

I don't know, guys, sorry to just kinda dump this here. I know it's all scattered but it's just been on my head for the last couple of weeks now and I don't have anyone to talk to about it (and that's a different story in and of itself.) "
I hate how much trouble I have with reading and comprehension.,"It's such a conscious effort to actually absorb and process the information which the words are coming together to form. If I'm not careful, I'll read a whole page of a novel or more without actually knowing what I've just read. I have to slow down so much that the size of most novels becomes so daunting, I get discouraged and don't set time aside to read.

Even when I do get through a chapter, somehow I feel like I'm only getting a blurry gist of what's going on, rather than the clear picture most readers seem to describe when they refer to imagining what they're reading. And not too long after finishing a book, I can barely remember anything about it.

Lots of video games these days tell their story via ""audiologs"": snippets of exposition or narration that play back as the player continues to move around and interact with the game. I can't retain any of the information I'm hearing unless I stop playing and just listen until the log is finished.

I love stories and want to discover as many as I can, but focusing on the content and truly comprehending it is such a chore, and it's very disheartening."
I don't know what to do,"I feel like everything is pointless. I'm sitting in my living room on Easter with tears in my eyes while my family is blissfully unaware of my ridiculous levels of self-deprecation. I don't want to reach out to them as they don't understand, I know, I've tried. I know I may sound like a typical ""misunderstood"" 18 year old, but this has been a seemingly chronic problem since I was young.

I'm insecure, hateful, bitter, resentful right now and I don't know what to do. I don't have the time to encourage a hobby or something as I'm a Dual Enrollment student and will be graduating from college soon.

I can't cope."
My apartment is awful.,"I just signed a lease on a new apartment. The landlord wouldn't let me see it, as it wasn't in show able condition, instead showing me a similar unit (not a model). Today, I went to visit and noticed the door was unlocked. To put it lightly, I was horrified. The place was trashed (there was literal poo on the floor) and in generally disgusting condition. Now, I know that the floors will be replaced, walls painted, etc. what I'm most worried about are the things that won't be switched- the hideous tile in the bathroom, the mismatched appliances, etc. The apartment I saw was nice. The one I'm getting is horrid and not comparable. I don't know what to do."
I don't know what to do now,"I'm going to keep this brief, but I could expand if needed.

I flunked out of university last year spring semester, got into a technical college thing and I'm doing shitty with my grades again.  I don't really have a good reason and I'm mostly here to rant.  I believe I could get away with just being on academic probation instead of suspension like last time, but I can't even imagine what it would be like disappointing my parents again.  I don't think I can live with that feeling.

Maybe I should have posted this to /r/rant or something.  If there is a more appropriate sub I will go there.

e: in retrospect, I never knew what to do so the now in the title is irrelevant.  I've spent my entire life not having a clue what to make a career out of, and now there isn't anything I have a passion for to want to do for the rest of my life or even just a decent amount of it.  I know a lot of this is just part of growing up, but I suck at that and school is something I do because I don't know what else I would do.

feel free to ask anything for clarification or anything in general"
My Past Continues to Haunt Me.,"I know people always say that before you move on to find a new significant other, you should be able to get over your past relationships and essentially have a ""Clean Slate"". However..I haven't been able to do this for years. Ever since my first serious girlfriend broke up with me (thankfully she did it when she did, or she would have just ended up cheating on me anyways), which was now a little over 2 years ago..I haven't been able to get over anything. 

She was first. My second serious relationship went downhill so quickly I don't even know what I did wrong. One day we were happily together and she was ready to head back to school, with my visits planned to see her already (we went to college together but I graduated first). The next day..she said she hated me and never wanted to talk to me. Since then I haven't been able to do anything to get those conversations out of my mind.

Despite those being my only two serious relationships, there have been countless other girls in my life who, for one reason or another, just quit talking to me. I think something can happen and suddenly it's just gone. Each one of them just starts taking a bigger and bigger toll on me. All of this then culminated in my first girlfriend coming back to me when she was having issues in life..only to have a Friends With Benefits relationship with me for about 3 months while she went around screwing other guys and eventually just broke it off because ""she couldn't focus on finding a serious relationship with me in her life"", even when I was the only guy who treated her decently and was there for her when she needed it, and now she's gone again.

Sadly, I don't have enough money to move out, and I don't have enough money to get to somewhere new at the moment. Hopefully that could happen in time, but for the time being i'm really stuck. I keep trying to get the past to leave, but it's just always there. Every day it comes back..every day I think about what I might have done wrong and how I could have fixed it and wishing I could go back in time and make things right from the beginning..but at the end of the day I just end up breaking down, crying, and just moving on to the next day.

What do I need to do about it? Is it as simple as finding someone new to get my mind off of the past problems, or is there something I can do to try and fix my mindset? I'm so lost I really don't know what to do..and any help would be appreciated."
Girl I like is having a tough time and I don't know what to do,"Slowly over the course of this year, i've grown to like a girl who's the captain of the sports team I've joined at university. My feelings for her are pretty strong however she's having a really tough time. She's currently bombarded with work as she's a final year where as I still have year to go. She's in charge of the sports team which is very big and active so it takes up a lot of her time. She's also having trouble moving on from her previous relationship who happens to be a friend of mine. He's not a really good friend of mine but we still see each other on a regular basis. They broke up last summer and it's still proving tough for her where as the ex is in a new relationship. What makes it worse for her is that her ex is also within the sports team so she see's him as well as his current partner on a regular basis. 

Basically I have no idea what to do. It just feels that she's not in the right frame of mind to have another relationship due to these issues. Ideally i'd love to ask her out but i'm in 2 minds about it. One is saying go for it but the other is saying give her space or you might lose out on a friend but this freaks me out as as she'll be graduating in a few months time so I feel like i'm running out of time. 

Just to clarify we see each other and talk on a daily basis, I'd say we're fairly good friends, it just hasn't progressed any further due to me not knowing what to do. My confidence isn't the strongest but it certainly has improved a drastic amount since joining university and meeting so many new people. 

Any help is appreciated thanks! "
These `fuckers` will not shut up and I can't do anything about it!,"I'm writing this without want for a solution! I'm just here to bitch really :P

I'm in halls at University and I've sustained a knee injury somehow. Incredibly painful - cannot go out or visit friends easily (or at short notice) and I've been advised to give it as much rest as possible. This means I'm stuck in my room pretty much all of the time.

I'm at the end of an all male corridor full of extremely alpha guys apart from me. All sports players, toned and handsome as fuck, aesthetically perfect in pretty much every way imaginable. Christ, I'm the shortest guy there by 2-3 inches and I'm 6`! All them are tossers and think they are the shit - I realised this early on and have avoided them ever since. Not spoken to them in months.

I knew that they all casually fucked girls on a regular basis, but it took an injury and long periods in my room to realise how often they did (more than daily), how long, how loud etc.  For example, just now someone has finished fucking a girl - they start at 8 and finished around 10. Oh sweet Jesus! It's the worst thing! It's like watching and hearing someone chew food with an open mouth really, really, really loudly on steroids! I was keep up all night on Friday by 3 different people fucking at different times. Fell unconscious after 24 hours awake, and woke up to people fucking again - and so the cycle has continued ever since. 

Every other guy chooses to do other things when this all goes on, but I have no choice. I have to stay and hear everything. Yes, I can hear them through headphones. Full blast does it, but it hurts now after over a week like this. Ugh - I want everyone ever dead now! 

TL;DR - People fuck around me all the time, I can hear everything and I physically can't leave. It's the worst thing! UGH!!"
Part of my life dream may be impossible now.,"I have dreamed of joining the US Army since I was 12, now that i'm 17 I've been talking to a recruiter, figuring things out, we had it all planned out. Finish highschool, enlist as infantry, do my job and try to get into the Rangers. But apparently that isn't going to happen now. I was found to have scoliosis during a regular check back when I was like 11. My recruiter knows, we went and got x-rays done and everything, just a few weeks ago. Well the army says anything over a 10 degree curve is a no go, so I nervously awaited my medical records in the mail. When i got x-rays 2 years ago it was found to be a 3 degree curve, and the MD said it only went up a couple of degrees, and that since it causes no pain I am fine to do what I wanted to. (To about 5 or 6.) But the dipshit X-ray technician decided to throw in their own notes to the records, ""an 11 degree curve."" How does the MD say 6, and you say 11? My dreams are on the line here and your input may have crushed them, thanks. "
Have you seen the opening scene from Idiocracy?,"That feels like my life right now. I've been feeling very lonely lately and I am watching each of my friends get everything right the wrong way, while I sit here doing things (mostly) right and I'm getting everything wrong.

All I've ever wanted in life is to raise a family. I'm not a crazy girl; I've known people who have their marriage collage they created when they were ten who have been dreaming about getting that perfect rock from whatever man is pleased enough with them to ask them to spend the rest of their lives together - that's not me. I'm not baby crazy. I just want to meet a great guy that can be my partner and equal and wants to raise a family like I do.

Meanwhile, all of my friends are irresponsibly and accidentally getting pregnant, having children, and somehow finding their happiness in all of this. I'm not talking about ""best-of"" happiness, I'm not simply trolling their Facebook pages and looking at the surface of their edited lives, we're talking about people I'm very close to that I know well. People whose houses I spend time in and not as a guest. They really are pretty happy. Not perfect, nobody is, but happy.

Why do I have to be the one watching everyone else get what I want in life simply because I'm responsible with my birth control and discerning about my choice of bed partner? Why am I alone when I'm the only one of us working on personal growth and trying to better myself to be in a great position to achieve my goals? I'm the only one of my friends that even knows anything about children at ALL and yet they're popping them out like candy.

Please understand, this is a moment of weakness. Normally I let these things slide off and I understand that it simply isn't going to happen yet; what I'm doing is still right. I'm not going to poke holes in the condom of the next guy whose dick I trip over just for a fleeting chance at happiness. I know I'm on the right path, even if it's taking longer for me than it is for so many others. I am truly happy for their successes, it would not make me feel any better if they were failing.

It's just hard some days.

Some weeks.

In addition to this, a close friend of mine placed me firmly but gently in to the friend zone. That's a story in and of itself. He's not put off by my family attitude - in fact, that's something we agree on - but there are mitigating circumstances. It simply adds to my frustration in that...well, a guy who is up to the standards I would require of a future partner and father, someone perhaps a bit more attractive than I think I deserve, with all of these great qualities...isn't interested enough to give it a try. It's a blow to the ego, no matter the circumstances.

I know what to do about it, I'm just looking for a little bit of understanding. I obviously can't take this to either him or any of my friends with children without it being somewhat awkward, so I entreat you to give me some sorely-needed compassion. I just need an e-hug. Thank you.

TL;DR - Everyone is having babies except for me and I'm sad about it."
Ex-Friend with Benefits Tried to Kill Himself a Little Over a Week Ago,"I'm a sophomore at an extremely conservative Christian college in the Midwest.  I'm not so conservative (though prior to this year I hadn't done anything you can really call scandalous).  Anyway, last semester one of my guy friends asked if I wanted to have a one-night stand, and I said yes.  I was a virgin (which I told him) before that.  Anyway.  He was really nice and we messed around a few more times.

Then over Christmas break he texted me telling me that his therapist said he really shouldn't be messing around (I'd known he was seeing a therapist and that he tried to kill himself and was hospitalized last year).  So of course I didn't want to give him a hard time about that because I mean he's been having a shitty time anyway.

When we got back to school it was pretty awkward though (mostly my fault) but eventually we smoothed things over.  Then after about a month I saw him for an actual conversation for the first time since.  And he told me he'd tried to kill himself again.  I didn't tell the admin (DON'T GIVE ME A LECTURE I SWEAR TO GOD I'VE HEARD LIKE TWENTY ALREADY) but someone did and so he's at the hospital now.  Well he has been over a week and last year he told me he'd been there a week.

I'm worried I guess.  People just keep telling me like ""oh don't worry, at least you know he's safe"" but it's getting so annoying because YES I KNOW he's physically safe but I don't even want to think about how he's doing emotionally right now.

Is this the part where I tell you that I think my feelings for him (friendship/physical attraction initially) have grown stronger?  I'm just so conflicted.  I feel dumb I guess but I don't regret it at all.  I mostly miss him right now."
"I want to self harm, but I can't because boyfriend and being an adult now.","I did write an essay, but reddit fucked up and I cba to re-write it all. 

The long and short of it is that I used to hurt myself a lot, including cutting and starving. Went through 4 years of ED therapy and finally got well. 

My best friend and therapy buddy is drifting away from me due to us growing up and living our lives and it's making me really really sad to see. I can feel myself hating that our differing opinions just drives the wedge even further.

I feel full to the brim with emotion but I don't know how to deal with it - I've tried talking to her and it just doesn't seem to get us anywhere. 

I just needed to write this because I'm battling with my demons. I know that I won't hurt myself because I would hate for my boyfriend to see the marks and think that he had done something to make me feel sad - he's wonderful and doesn't deserve that. 

I'm just struggling to breath at the moment. Self harm seems so ridiculously appealing, even though I can already feel the post-cutting embarrassment. I'm fucking 22 and should be done with all of that bit of my life. "
Valentine's Day- I don't know how I should feel.,"Little backstory: I've been dating this guy for a little over two years now. He is wonderful and has always treated me very well, although he is not necessarily the most affectionate boyfriend I have ever had. As far as I know, there is currently nothing wrong with our relationship.

Anyway, it was Valentine's Day yesterday. I wanted to make my boyfriend smile, so I did get him a few things- a small box of Lindt chocolates, a little glass terrarium, bought a few steaks for dinner- and set them out for him to find in the morning (not including the steaks). I even found him an actual Valentine card that he found hilarious.

Now, I'm not one of those girls who makes a big deal out of Valentine's Day- personally, I believe if you are with someone, you should ALWAYS be caring and thoughtful towards one another, not just on one day of the year- but I do expect at least some form of acknowledgement. You don't have to buy me candy, or jewelry, or flowers, but a small card with some thoughtful words is nice. Even just taking me aside for a few minutes to tell me how you feel about me- I don't care. You don't have to spend money on me, I just want to know I have a Valentine on Valentine's Day. That's all I ask. Especially with my current boyfriend- I know he is not big on the affectionate stuff, so I don't expect it of him on a regular basis, but I thought that since this would be our second Valentine's Day together (actually the first; we didn't get to celebrate previously, since he was working 12-hour shifts at the time), he might at least have a few sweet words for me. 

There was nothing. No card, not even a ""Happy Valentine's Day"" until I said it to him first. He thanked me for the gifts, and that was about it. We went through the entire day as if it were any other. And no, he didn't forget it was Valentine's Day. He'd even made comments about Valentine's Day coming up in the days beforehand. 

I feel quite miffed about it, and I also feel bad about the fact that this upsets me. It's just a stupid Hallmark holiday that means nothing, and my boyfriend treats me well... I shouldn't be letting this get to me.

It's funny... I see all my single friends on Facebook whining about how they're spending yet another Valentine's Day without a Valentine. Well, I'm not single... but I didn't have a Valentine yesterday either. Heh.

I don't know. Someone... please just tell me I'm being a spoiled, entitled bitch on this one. I feel horrible about the fact that it upsets me. "
I failed a class,"I used to be a straight A student, to the point where getting a B would horrify me. In ninth grade, I had a really crummy math teacher, which resulted in my math grade to sink down to a C. The fact that since high school started, I made a LOT more friends than I had in middle school, which only increased in 10th grade, causing me to mess around in class with them.
The only reason I got the C was putting in a lot of extra effort, which took its toll on my other grades, netting me two Bs as well.
I shook it off, because everyone was saying that the math teacher I'd have in tenth grade was amazing. Unfortunately, he quit before 10th grade started. The new teacher seemed okay at first, but it became apparent he was just as bad, if not worse, than the old one. I only knew one person who was getting an A in his class. I was constantly getting at best a b or c in his class, and I was kind of ok with that. Then we started trig. My grade dropped like a rock. I had an E(lowest letter grade at my school, no F). I though I could fix it, but it was too late. The semester came to a close. 3 people failed that class,many others came extremely close. I try to not think about it, but for the past few days I've slowly been realizing what has happened. I feel extremely down about myself. My parents aren't helping much, basically yelling at me and taking away all my electronics. I just feel shitty in general about myself now."
I don't know how I'm going to survive.,"Right now, I'm a master's student making 20k a year. My rent is 1100 a month, since I receive parental support and they picked my apartment. However, money has recently become a huge issue between us (booked a trip to a conference, they chose a hugely expensive hotel, they bitched about the cost of the hugely expensive hotel and how irresponsible I was being with their money). 

I've been thinking about the possibility of moving in June (when my lease is up). I don't even know if my parents will let me or not, and I can't afford moving without their support. I have no savings of my own because my entire salary goes to rent and car insurance (which my parents selected). I live off of what they give me (which is generous), but if they stopped providing those funds, I'd be broke. I don't know how I'd afford move-out costs in my apartment. I don't know how I'd afford move-in costs. I don't know how to pay summer fees (900 bucks) on my salary. I'm not even sure I qualify for a loan or anything else, since I just got a credit card a year ago and might not have a credit score yet. I don't know anything, and the people I'd go to for that are my parents. 

On top of all of this, I am horribly depressed. I'm exhausted all the time, battling a food addiction, and paying for depression meds out of pocket because my parents would disown me if I told them I was seeing a doctor for depression. The meds aren't working, so I'm basically paying to try and fail to prevent me wanting to off myself. I was able to get the doctor visits covered through the school (no record of it... long story). Without that, I couldn't even afford to see the doctor. I'm not on any meds right now, because I weaned off the ones that weren't working and am too depressed/exhausted/terrified of the cost to go fill the new script. I don't really feel like I have anybody to rely on anymore. When I first got depressed, people were really supportive. Now, I've lost one of my best friends and the rest don't even notice me. 

I can't even live out of my car for a few months, because I have cats. I don't know anybody that could take them either, and I'm not sure I'd survive not having them around when I get really depressed. I don't think I can move in with anybody either- not only do I have furniture (and animals), but I spend so much of my time crying that I would not be a good fit for anybody. I'm scared out of my mind, I don't know where I stand with my parents, and I don't know how I'm going to wake up tomorrow and deal with this on top of being a full-time graduate student with a looming conference presentation, trying to beat a food addiction, and having my own brain whisper nonstop that it'd be easier to just end it all. I feel so alone, and it's getting harder to ignore the whispers."
I wish I could believe we'll have a fairy tale ending,"I met you again in a funny way. At the time I was working on me, opening up my sexuality, and becoming the fierce lioness I possess on the inside. It had been weeks since I had a kiss. I knew you would kiss me. I looked at you, sitting in my passenger seat and you questioned me. I just stared. You said later it was my eyes, and the intense look I can give when I want something. We kissed passionately. At the time I wanted to just throw you away when I was done, but of course, that's not how this tale goes. 

I challenged you. I dared you. You took every challenge like a stick on the ground and stepped over it. We talked shit, fell into each other's arms and had rough, passionate sex that I know one day I'll have with someone else. I tied you up. I force fed you myself, and you gulped it up with the vigor of only a man addicted. 

You cuddled. You kissed gently on my cheek. And I knew I was falling. 


For weeks we challenged what we knew was there. I KNOW you felt it too. You were scared of my passion. 

I kept trying to keep you away but it was like refusing a drug that was sitting on your bathroom counter. 

This final time I plunged the knife into my beating heart and ripped it out with my bare hands. My passion, when slighted, becomes vicious. It kills me to be without you, but it kills me more to be mean, and fall into the passion. My heart now resides in a box next to my window. The only warmth it gets is from the sunlight. Why should I try? I love myself, I do fantastically alone. I can care for myself. I will survive. That's one thing I'm great at. I have decided you are dead to me.

But deep down, I hope you'll realize this is a challenge for you. How much do you value me? How addicted are you to me?

If you're struggling, find me. Drive to me. You know our spots. If you want me, find a fairy tale ending. Take back what you said and plead with me. Because you're not as cold as you think you are. You're vulnerable. You miss me too. This is a challenge on your masculinity, be a FUCKING man and LEAP! Stop fearing the end. Stop fearing how you'll be when you're stuck. Because you know you'll fall into me and you'll be happy and content and you're scared of living life comfortably. You're scared of love. You're scared of trusting someone. 

Maybe I got you all wrong and you're a con artist. Truthfully you'll never see this. But If you want me, find me. Because I'm beautiful, smart, lovely, and amazing. Someone eventually will try to open my heart up again and it will be too late. 

Come and get me, you Poopsicle. Or accept I'm not willing to have you in my life. You can't eat your cake and have it too. "
"I'm an unmoativated, lazy little bitch. Any solutions to my life?","Hey guys, I had an exam today which I totally failed. I had all the Christmas holidays to revise, yet I didn't do any. I told myself that today was the day, but it didn't help. I think I picked the wrong course to do, but it's my second time starting a course, so I need to stick through it. How can I try to enjoy it a bit more? I study Computer Science by the way.

I'm getting confused by this girl.,"I don't know what she wants. Sometimes she likes me. Sometimes she doesn't. I know she's not just playing me or using me. The feelings are real, when they're there. Sometimes, she talks to everyone BUT me. Others, she won't talk to ANYONE but me. Should I just get over her and move on? Is there something I could say or do to figure this out? I love her. And I want her happy. And if that means I have to leave to get her out if this back and forth business, so be it.

EDIT: I asked her out on a date. She said yes! Thanks for the support, guys. Without you, I might have let the opportunity slip."
My dad refuses to stay out of my life..,"My parents divorced after 25+ years of unhappy marriage. My father is diagnosed bipolar, but refuses medication. Until recently, I thought that my father was to blame for their ruined marriage and mine and my sister's unhappy childhood that was a result of their constant bickering. The divorce was the best path. My father got more in the divorce, but refuses to see it that way. My mother got the house, where I still reside as I'm in my junior year of high school. My father and mother currently have a relationship externally that would be viewed as ""friends."" They run errands for each other, fuss about people who give them trouble (other then each other) in their lives, ect. Internally, one can observe unnecessary issues with their relationship. There's a reason divorced people often don't speak to each other anymore. My father comes over to our house, accuses my mom of seeing other people (she isn't seeing anyone, but there'd be nothing wrong with it obviously), and sometimes begs her to get back together. He also comes over and camps out in the recliner and watches hours of netflix under the guise of spending time with me. I've mentioned that we never spend time, and all he does is watch netflix- my mom just says she feels sorry for him, and we end up getting in arguments. I mentioned earlier that I used to think it was all his fault. I'm now of the opinion that it's both of their faults. My dad is crazy, and although he's still somewhat responsible for his actions- my mom is not crazy, and refuses to sever ties with him. I'm of the opinion that severing ties would be the best course of action, a way to force him into getting some treatment for his bipolar disorder. My sister also thinks this would be best, but refuses to talk to my mother about it (she's older an adult, her opinion carries more weight than mine) because it might upset her. Even now, my dad is in the living room watching the television quite loudly. I feel like going in there, telling him that his isn't his house- and that he isn't welcome here. This would be a lie though, because I'm not the homeowner, and he is welcome here. I don't know what to do about the situation, or if there is really anything that I can/should do. I've lost a tremendous amount of respect for my mother over the situation, and I haven't respected my father in years. It sickens me."
I'm mentally and physically fucked.,"Where to start... 

I'm unhappy.  Straight up.  I've gotten into rut a that I'm not sure I can make it out of, and it's costing me the (so called) best years of my life. 

I'll try and speed this up so I don't bore any of you to death.  

It started two years ago when my  SO of ~4 years broke up with me for the 2nd (and final) time.  I was a typical depressed mess, as are most people in that situation, but I reverted back to my old habit of wrist cutting.  Focusing on the warm red burn helped me to take my mind off my ex and everything else I attempted just reminded me of them.  I got over it eventually, but something lingered.  It changed me. 

I used to be a fairly open person with my friends.  I could talk about anything, even some dark memories from the past. I could speak to them about my struggles with eating disorders, self-harm, and about how I was raped a long time ago when I was a much smaller person.  But now I am a closed, locked, double bolted, chained, welded shut door.

I don't even like my friends anymore.  I feel like they just put up with my shit so that if I kill myself, they'll be able to say ""at least we were there.""  

They always come to me with their problems because I listen and try to give the best unbiased advice about whatever is bothering them, and afterwards they will sometimes ask me how I am doing.  ""Fine.""  

Sometimes I like to see what I can get away with around them.  A couple months ago while we were all getting ready to go out for the night, I crept into my room when nobody was looking with a filet knife.  When it was time to head out, I sliced a pretty decent chunk right out of the inside of my forearm.  Half way to a house party, one of them noticed the blood trickling and told me I was bleeding. I played it off as though I was drunk and must have collided with something.  I also like to joke about killing myself.  They think its funny and sometimes they make suicidal jokes too.  

My self-confidence is pitiful.  I've resorted back to starving myself for a few days and then smoking weed and binging for a night.  I know I'm underweight, but I've never had an accurate image of what I look like.  I'm pretty short (5'5) so I feel like I will always look fat no matter what I do.  One of my friends (who's known me long enough to know about my eating disorder) says things to me almost daily that drag me down even further.  A couple examples: last spring a week before break I was encouraged to stop eating again before we went on vacation (and I did), a few days ago I was complimented on being thicker than I was at the end of the summer (I've lost 8 pounds since).  This person also has an outstanding history of cock-blocking me. 

I don't know if my hair has always shed this much, or if it's all falling out.  More than a year ago I noticed that I could run my fingers through my hair (like a comb) numerous times, and come up with a huge clump of hair.  I do this every night now.  I just sit here and run my fingers through my hair and keep track of how many of my hairs fall out.  Before long my keyboard is just a mess of hair balls.  Sometimes I put the clumps of hair into this little drawer.  There's probably enough to donate in there.. but my hair doesn't look much different, and I've become obsessed with proper hair hygiene. 

Falling asleep at night is a struggle at best.  I sit like a drone at my computer until 6 in the morning, and then when I finally decide that its time to try to sleep, something strange happens.  Just as I can feel myself drifting off to sleep, my heart goes absolutely crazy.  It's like a shot of adrenaline.  I'm not talking about a falling dream, or something like that.. My heart just starts racing out of nowhere.  

Waking up is near impossible.  I never feel well rested.  I skip a lot of class and I'm late to work every day because I just can't get up.  

Sometimes I physically feel what I can only describe as hate.  It's like an ice-covered firestorm in my skull that slowly corrupts the rest of my body in the form of a chill, shivering down my spine.  If it wasn't for my immense love for my pets and all animals, I don't know how I would cool down from this.  

The last thing I'm going to mention for now are my feelings for a person.  It's wrong, but I really like someone who is dating another one of my friends.  Sometimes I think that this person feels the same way.  Others have also expressed that they think this person is into me, but I deny it to them because even if they were... it would never work.  The person they are dating has been a friend for a very long time.  It is difficult to bury these thoughts sometimes.  


I don't know what I'm hoping to achieve by putting this stuff on here... but maybe letting some of this out will make me feel a bit better.  It's past 6am, so I guess I should try and get some sleep.

I'm starting to feel lonely,"Hello, first of all, thanks for taking your time to read this, I really appreciate it.

I'm a man, 24 years old and never really had a girlfriend. I've dated a few girls once in a while but it never got serious and never lasted long.

I was really ok with that in the past, I haven't really felt the need to have a relationship as I see most people do, I always tough that I'll have someone worth it when its time.

But obviously you cannot choose who you have a crush on. As far I remember, I had 7 big crushes, basically one each school grade or new job during the last years.

The problem is that I never knew (in fact, I still don't know) how to deal with a crush, I remember always pretending I was talking to her and planning to, on the next day, finally talk to her but ended, on the last moment, doing nothing and feeling disappointed with myself for that and every time it happened I hurt myself a little more.

I feel like all this happened because I was afraid to lost a real good friendship which caused me to never know what exactly to say, I'm really introvert and don't talk much, so when it comes to talk about my feeling I normally freeze and no word comes out. When it comes to talk about something else, I have no issues at all, even when I have to talk or perform something to a crowd.

After all that I think I learnt how not to have a crush on someone to not hurt myself, it's about 3 ~ 4 years since the last one and I was still ok with that until now.

I'm starting to feel the need to have someone closer to me, to hug someone not just to compliment, to share some laughs, to discover things together (new good musics, places, movies, books, ...), to enjoy someones else company. 

I always see happy couples having a good time together doing all that things mentioned before or just by enjoying each others shoulder/nap and want the same.

I'm not hasty, I know if I push to hard for it to happens it might be a bad experience and that's exactly what I don't want right now.

Besides that I have absolutely nothing to complain about, I have a really good family, I'm healthy, so are my family and friends, just finished college last year, have a good and stable job, no debts, ...

The only thing I want for now is this anguish to go alway from my chest, that's all. 

And again, thank you for you time."
I'm not sure I can handle being single (confidence issues),"I broke up with my boyfriend of 4+ years about 2 months ago. It was for the best, but I'm having a hard time staying positive now that I'm single. I'm a college student (undergrad). I've always been overweight, but over the past 2 years I've lost over 100lbs. I've been hitting the gym more often since the breakup just for something to do. I'm still overweight, but I'm working on it. I try very hard to dress up every day and make myself look my absolute best for classes, the dining hall, etc, because I'm seriously so anxious that I will ruin my chance to find someone new if I ever for even one second look too frumpy. I've made it a personal policy to try new things and talk to as many people as I can. I've even gone out to a couple of bars on the weekends with some friends to try and meet somebody.

All I really want right now is companionship. I really want to go out and date somebody, even just make new friends to talk to. Hell, I'd just like someone to text me now and again and make me feel like I'm loved by someone, instead of me always having to initiate conversations and feeling like a burden as a result. I'm frustrated because it isn't happening. I do understand that the world doesn't just make friends/boyfriends appear, but I'm just scared that I threw away the only person who was willing to put up with me, my personality and my weight, and now I'll be alone forever. 

On top of this, I have a lot of anxiety related to school stuff (applying for internships, scholarships, finals coming up etc) that is really eating away at me. I've been so emotional lately that it's getting in the way of me getting things done.  What can I do to stay focused on what's really important (school), without feeling depressed? Also, with winter break approaching, I'll be moving back home for 6 weeks, and the prospect of being completely isolated for that long makes me extremely unhappy. My school friends live too far away to see them regularly, and I don't feel comfortable asking them to skype me all the time because I'll feel so needy and gross when they're trying to enjoy their home-friends. I just don't know how to be happy by myself anymore. Any advice is welcome.

"My studies bore me, the girl I love lives thousands of miles away and I dont really know what I want","Hey folks, let me introduce myself first:

I'm a 17 year old aerospace engineering student from Germany. Although the following will sound cheesy as fuck (I know it is) bare with me:

About 2 months ago I met a girl on omegle and we've been talking twice a day for almost all the time now. A few weeks ago I confessed that I kinda like her (a bit more than that) and she admitted the same. To make it short: we basically confessed that we love each other. Whenever I'm talking with her I'm feeling great but lately it's starting to fill me with sadness because everytime we talk I realise that chances are that I'll never see her in person. It's gotten so far that it actually keeps me down for an entire weekend. 

Furthermore I've found out that aerospace engineering isn't what I really want to do and despite already having an alternative plan what to do, a friend of mine recently gave me the idea of maybe going to the US to study. But because tution fees are very high I've been looking for a scholarship online and haven't found one that's either realistic or relevant yet. I'm kind of afraid that our 'relationship' or whatever we have there will slowly but steadily fall apart. Obviously I don't want that to happen but I don't know how to prevent it either. I know it might just be stupid teenager love (and it probably is) but it still bothers me. 

I also don't know whether I should just accept my fate or try my hardest to travel to the US or maybe look to study in the US. 

By the way, on the last topic: does anyone know of scholarships for foreign students that can't afford to pay (the entire) tution fees?


Even if you don't have an answer for me, it just felt good to get this all of my chest and for those who read through it all: thank you"

acne problems,"i have a lot of acne and acne scars for years now, i get made fun of and i have lost all confidence to meet new people and talk to girls.

I have been to the doctors, been on antibiotics, tried everything in the shops, changed my diet. It just does not work"
I said something insensitive and it's killing me inside.,"I was elected to host a cast after-party after performing in a play, and did so willingly. Once everybody showed up, we sat in a giant circle and basically began playing silly games; spin the bottle, truth or dare, etc. It was fun! At one point, we were playing Never Have I Ever, where you basically say ""never have I ever _____"", and everyone who has done such a thing takes a drink. I was fairly inebriated, but not the point where I wasn't thinking properly. In my infinite stupidity, I simply said the first thing that came to my mind.

""Never have I ever contemplated suicide.""

I don't know why my mind strayed to such a bad topic at the time, nor do I have reason for why I didn't stop myself, but I'm incredibly glad that we were able to move on immediately from that. 

The rest of the party was fun, everybody had a good time from what I could tell, but I was upset by what I had said. I don't know how I made any of those folks feel, but I'm sure someone was upset with me at least at some point though the night. 

As soon as we had done our goodbyes and hugs and everybody left, I wanted to cry. I sat in my kitchen for an hour upset, knowing that I probably won't see some of those people again for a long time. I didn't get a chance to apologize for saying what I did, and I can't un-say anything. I feel bad about something I can't change anymore, and I don't know what to do about it.

fucking ugh"
My cousin attempted suicide.,"My cousin just attempted to commit suicide by overdose on pills. He was home on break, where I assume he took the pills, and when my other cousin stopped by to pick him up he found him in the driveway having a seizure. They called the ambulance and brought him to the nearest hospital in a nearby town. No one really knew why he was rushed to the hospital besides the fact that he was having a seizure. When I had the chance to visit him I walked in on him crying with his mother saying, ""I'm just so tired of this life. Why does it have to be so hard?"" It hit me really hard hearing him say those words. I held his hand and cried with him. It just really baffles me why he would want to end his life. I've been constantly thinking about seeing him like that since yesterday."
"I make everyone laugh, but i'm alone.","Everything I say makes people laugh, so they must enjoy my company, but I am still left in the dust. Could it be because I speak too much? Sometimes I feel like that must hinder myself because it ends up making me look silly. I'll say something that is self-deprecating, for example. Which I don't mind because I like to make people happy. But perhaps that is the problem. Maybe they don't respect me and such. 

I imagine if I am leaving everything out there with girls that isn't good either. Sure I know everyone which they must be attracted to but I feel like if I say the occasional dumb thing or use self-deprecating humor they'll be less likely to be interested. 

Maybe it also stops people from taking me seriously. I imagine that makes it bad for myself. I have a very serious side to myself, but I only show it when a person needs advice or on an intellectual topic. So perhaps people just never bring that stuff up to me, which makes up half of a relationship with a human being and thus it makes us less than friends. 

I am just frustrated because everyone seems to like me, and I know a lot of people, but I tend to sit alone eating at the dining hall at college. I sit home a lot on the weekends too. 

I also feel like perhaps my ridiculous attitude towards things is hindering my success in general. I  never get work done and perhaps if I took things a bit more seriously, my work would get done. 

I just feel like I have so much to say, but I should just start saying less so I avoid the duds and the awkward/lame ones that might be frowned upon. Perhaps people would respect me more and desire to get to know me more if I wasn't so forward. "

Work,"Throw away time.

I've got a HUGE deadline looming at work. I've only got 3-4 weeks remaining, but my immediate bosses keep changing what I need to do or forcing me to start a fresh.

I'm putting in 60-70 hour weeks and getting nothing but, ""we need you to start again, but do it differently"" out of it. The work I'm doing is not possible with the tools I'm using, but management wont hear any of that, they just keep telling me that it ""must be doable. If not, try using this tool/technique that we found after a few seconds of Googling,"" which has lead to me wasting days on end collecting evidence that something can't be done, rather than it just being accepted and worked around.

Every few weeks, I'm being taken away from my current project and told that I'm spending a week doing completely unrelated tasks, ""because someone has to do it,"" which is impacting on my ability to reach the deadline.

Because of all the above, I'm not sleeping or eating properly, neither am I getting time to exercise so my health has taken a direct hit. I'm supposed to be taking a big exam (that has nothing to do with my employment) soon, but studying for that has been put on hold (which means that I'll forfeit my entry, or will do poorly). My relationship with my SO has taken a *HUGE* hit, too. She lives 150 miles away, and I'm not getting the time to go see her or her to come see me.

My colleagues seem to know more about my current (deadline) project than I do, which tells me that someone intentionally isn't telling me what I need to be doing for a reason. The extremely exhausted, *VERY RECENT* stomach ulcer suffering side of me is left thinking that there is a very specific reason why folks are telling me things (paranoid, I know).

There's more, but I think that might be identifiable so I'll leave it for now.

Kidney Stones Are Ruining My life!,"Hey guys,

I'm not really expecting any help but just want to vent it out. I have been having an issue with kidney stones since the past six years or so. I am aged 26 and I can attribute the formation of kidney stones to heriditory factors mostly. Ofcourse, my diet and not drinking enough water has contributed to it too. 

So, I am currently having 11 kidney stones the maximum of which is 9mm. Every time I pass a kidney stone, it sucks the life out of me and I want to kill myself. I am other wise a happy guy but every painful episode makes me really depressed.

Each time a painful episode occurs, Im put in the hospital and supportive treatment is provided till I pass the stone. Usually it takes a couple of days but I become sick and weak for few days after that. I lose 2-4 kgs in this time. I get an episode every 6 months to one year.

I have increased my water intake for the past 8- 10 months but the stones have only increased. The type of kidney stones I form are of the calcium oxalate type.

I am going to try lemon juice therapy for now. Some guy on you tube suggests drinking concentrated lemon juice of one glass weekly once. Citrate is known for its action against kidney stones.So, Im gonna try that and hope for the best. I have tried numerous alternative medicine stuff before without much luck.

Other factors Im trying to control
-Drinking enough water
-Reducing Protein in my diet
-Have to reduce sodium too.

If anybody can offer me some advice or help, I would really appreciate it.

"i am inherently inferior to others. i will never improve, this is determined by who i am. there is no reason to try so hard if my life will never genuinely improve.","i'm 21 and have failed at every corner of my life. lost my job, have no friends that i can see regularly. i moved away from my friends earlier this year, but even they were sick of my shit. i'm a failure when it comes to women. every single person in my old social group had more than 15 partners, and i have had zero. this indicates that i am inherently inferior to them, women sense that and avoid me at all costs. i can't figure out why, but i know for a fact that i am a repellant to women. i don't think that there's anything wrong with me in particular, but i suppose that i am just that kind of person who is constructed in a way that sends messages down to women's brains that says i am just one to be avoided at all costs.

i go to community college for the time being. it fucking sucks. nothing to do but go to class, go home, be alone at home and study.

i can get my degree, land a good job, work. do the things i enjoy alone during my free time, but it will always be shit because i WILL be alone. i know this for a fact because, again, i have never had sex and every other person in my social group has had more than a dozen, easily. the only explanation for this is that i am just, by some quality of my being, sending signals to women's brains that says AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS.

life is fucking garbage. i am girl kryptonite. it's not my fucking appearance/hygiene/confidence/social skills/lack of hobbies. if you saw my picture you would shower me with comments about how cute i am, if you saw me in real life you wouldn't even talk to me. that's the truth, and i will never know why because nothing awaits me in life but shit and loneliness."
College applications are creeping up on me.,"I don't feel like I've accomplished as much as I thought I had. When it all goes down on paper, everything I've done looks like a lot less. To add to that, I only have a month until my most important application is due, and I still have multiple essays and a video to throw together for that. I really feel like there's no way I can do it. I feel helpless right now."
Just A Downswing,"Things have been going okay.  I've got my head in a couple projects, got my scooters to fix, kids to play with, day job, friends.  There's a new girl I have a crush on, lots of events coming up.

But today, I broke down and thought of you.

I watched that damn Story Corps thing with Annie and Danny, and someone posted about the first few minutes of UP and now I can't stop thinking about you and missing you.  It's been almost 3 months.  Each day is different, most days lately I'm fine.  Today is not one and I know I'm going to spend the rest of today trying to play mind games online.  I really do want to be your friend, I really want to stay in touch.  I really want you to live your life and be happy.  I just wish it was with me.

Now I have to get back to being okay and being on my own.  I can't write you, can't text you.  My friends are tired of hearing about this.  So I'm writing here just to get it out of my head.  Hopefully I can focus and not break down at work.

I'm having such a hard time letting you go, and I don't know why.  You're so much younger, you're so far away, we're going different directions.  And yet you linger in my head.  We were going to be married, we were going to live a blissfully geeky life and now we aren't and the hole is just too big to fill back in with my own life.

Today is just a bad day."
Figured out too late I hate my major,I'm 24 and graduating with my BA this December. I don't like my major but by time I figured that out I felt like it was too late to switch. I don't like any potentional careers in my chosen field and can't see myself happy doing any of them. I've been thinking about going to a trade school once I graduated because my other great fear is that I'll have a degree and still be serving tables. I figure if I have a trade at least I will have something while I figure out if I want to get a Masters or go for another bachelors. No matter what it's more time and money and student loan debt for me. So that's what's bothering me.
"I live in constant fear, and I don't know how anyone doesn't.","I'm three months away from losing my health insurance when I turn 26 (not that I still haven't managed to rack up $4,000 in medical debt even *on* health insurance from ER visits and random shit). I live in fear that I'm going to have to pick between paying bills/loans and treating a bladder infection, choose wrong, and either end up incurring a few extra hundred in late fees and/or interest (on top of what I will have already spent at the doctor), or end up with kidney damage. (I get UTIs distressingly often, despite drinking tons of water and taking those cranberry pills, and I'm *not even sexually active* jesus fuck.) 

I don't know how *anybody* lives in the United States without constant pants-shitting fear that they're going to get sick and end up homeless, though I know I'm not alone in that regard. 

I have a dog. People would probably say, ""In your financial position, you really shouldn't have a dog."" But that dog's presence in my car has, occasionally, been the only reason I did not drive into the side of a building in a fit. He's a poodle I found at the pound (so no breeder to ask about family history), and seems to have stomach trouble. I can't take him to the vet until monday, but it seems his frequent burping is not actually an endearing trait, but indicative of something else wrong, especially paired with the occasional unexplained barfs. 

I don't mind spending money to help him; my student loans don't snuggle me at night, fuck those guys. If it ends up being some kind of chronic health problem that deteriorates his health, I don't know what I'm going to do. ""That dog"" and ""it would make my mom sad"" are the two reasons I haven't done something irrevocably stupid to myself. 

I make a little above minimum wage as a ""web developer"", full-time (hey, at least I have a job). I put it in quotes because ""turning PSD designs into Wordpress websites"" barely counts as a web developer to most and I realize I'd be nigh unemployable at my skill level anywhere else. It is not what my degree is in (I got halfway through student teaching before I realized I was *terrible* at it and it was in no way worth the massive stress to me) and I fear that even though I am *learning constantly*, there is no future in this for me. I fear being unable to support myself. Without this job, I am qualified to... wash dogs for groomers. And I am aware that minimum wage wouldn't even pay for an apartment (on top of the other expenses that I *have* to pay), let alone pay my loans back. 

I'm also facing down being 26 and moving back home just to pay back my shit. I am immensely grateful that I have the *ability* to, and recognize that I'd rather be the loser living at home paying debts down than that loser who got evicted and had to go live in her sedan, but *man* do I feel like I've failed. 

And then there's the caldera under Yellowstone. I can't even look at the midwest on a map without my heart rate shooting through the roof. Environmental degradation because more environmentally-friendly practices are just not economically viable for a lot of things. The fact that I will be in debt for a very, very long time and probably will rent until the day I die because I won't be able to do anything else. 

There's the fact that my body and brain are both too defective for military service which, though I *completely understand* why those standards are in place and recognize that I would not deal with that stress well, still makes me feel like a worthless sack of shit. 

I'm stressed that I have to plan a bachelorette party despite being *the worst at parties* and I fear having to talk to anyone over the phone to make reservations, because phones make my anxiety shoot through the roof. I feel like a shitty friend for letting it upset me so much.

Life is terrifying, I am terrible, and my two biggest anchors to reality (my mother and my dog) both have sketchy health. I physically feel like I can barely breathe right now. Aaand I can't afford to go back to the therapy that I know I need, hahaha fuck."
I'm not happy in my apartment.,"Heads up, this is very much a first world problem.

I currently live in a luxury apartment building in Quincy, a Boston suburb, paying the max of my budget for the place. It was attractive to me at first because of it's proximity to work and because, well, I've been living in crappy apartments ever since college and I wanted to feel like an adult. I'm 24/M.

After I moved in, small things kept piling up. I've noticed that while I thought my commute would be roughly 15-20 minutes, trains are often delayed as I'm going in and out of the city during the 9-5 rush and the station I live at is remote. Often, trains get re-routed and I end up waiting for a train going home for 15-20 minutes, adding a crazy amount of commute time. 

In addition to this, the apartment itself is not quite as ""luxury"" as I was meant to believe. There are leaks in the ceiling sometimes and the electrical will frequently short-circuit, forcing me to lose anything I was doing on the computer. The windows don't actually open all the way as some sort of design idea to block elements from coming in through the window - unfortunately this blocks cool air from getting in as well. This forces us to keep the a/c on or remain uncomfortable all day. After a quick check of my bill, I've already paid one month's worth of my last apartment's electric in a short 10 days. The location itself is also not as great as I perceived; I thought it was a hip, up and coming area. I'm realizing now that it's sort of dead, really busy with street traffic, and people my age are closer to the city or in other areas. For reference, Quincy Center to somewhere like Cambridge or Somerville.

On top of all of this, my roommate(s) are questionable. I was told moving in that my roommate had a very serious girlfriend, and that she would be staying for a few weeks at a time between jobs that took her travelling for months at a time. Since moving in, I've found out that she doesn't even have a visa, and is basically living in our apartment as an illegal alien. She cannot get a job until she gets a visa or becomes a citizen, making it extremely hard for her to get a job. So I'm essentially paying half of our rent, while she squats in his room. Also, they have other friends over for dinner parties frequently and make messes in our kitchen, waiting days before cleaning it up.

My lease allows for subletting which I'm looking into now - I'm talking to our landlord about my options and looking at cheaper places in better areas. I'm a frugal person at heart and watching so much money go to a place that I'm not happy in is just staggering to my mentality.

TLDR; My apartment sucks and I want out."
Ouch Mom.,"So my mom just told she'd rather me be pan that gay (I explained pan to her last week). Ouch mom. I'd understand if I'd just told you, but I've been out for six months. That stings. If we could have one fucking conversation about this without you bringing up 'I don't want you to put yourself in a box.'

FUCK THAT! I LIKE MY FUCKING BOX! Do you realize how fucking much I've struggled with this? Do you remember me throwing myself at everything with a penis last fall because I couldn't figure out what was fucking wrong with me? Seriously, fuck off!

I have tried everything I can possibly think of to find myself attracted to men. I've fucking tried. Quit saying 'I don't care, but' or 'I'm fine with it, but'. STOP! STOP! STOP! Either you don't mean it or your a shitty communicator. They both make me feel like shit. Please stop.

revenge,"when i was 18, a senior in highschool, my art teacher (jennifer havrey) told me “youre going to grow up and do nothing with your life”  i already have very low self esteem, and this killed me. it took everything i had to not cry in front of the entire class. i just played it cool. “ok whatever” and continued to put my head down like i didnt care. im 20 now and not a single day goes by when i dont replay this scene or repeat her words in my head. this has effected me more than anything else in my life. its only fair i effect her the same way she has effected me. every night i go to bed and i fantasize and think about how i can effect her psycologically the same way she did to me. ive been studying psychosis and mental illness and what causes these things and will continue studying until i can prove to her that i “did something with my life” and can show her not only did i do something with my life but also how a simple sentence can effect someone so deeply and emotionally. and she will experience the same pain that i experience everyday. she will understand whats its like to hate yourself. she will understand what its like to have people constantly laugh at your dreams. she will understand suicidal tendencies. its the wrong thing to do but you have no idea what ive been through, you have no idea how this has effected me. it will be done. jennifer will feel just as bad, if not worse than i feel about myself.

It's not even my problem but I've had enough of it.,"My best friend is in an abusive marriage. They haven't even been married that long. She sends me pictures of the bruises he gives her. They argue over the dumbest things! I've told her multiple times to report his drunk ass to the police but she uses the ""But I love him"" card... I've even been harsh with the cold truth pulling the ""If he really did love you like he said he wouldn't be treating you like that"" card. Her last boyfriend did this to her too, but this was before I met her. I save all of the messages she sends me of him threatening her, and the pictures of her bruised face and body. What really bothers me is that they act like the ""happy couple"" when I am around or when other friends are around. Even on facebook and Instashit they have pictures where they seem stuck in a surreal love cave. I've had enough of it. I don't want to hear any of the bullshit anymore. I told her to do something or deal with it.... She is choosing to deal with it, and me being the friend, it makes me deal with it too. She's begged me not to go to the police or to her family. What else can I do? I can't even stand being in the same room as that asshole without imagining throwing a hot iron at him. 

Yesterday was the last straw... I was dropping off her birthday cupcake, red velvet (her favorite). I met up with her at her house, she was waiting in her car & when she got out to greet me, she was limping. I walked with her inside, her husband was on the couch and he starting being a smart ass to me, of course I don't put up with anyones BS so I shut him up. I go to her room and tell her to let me see it... she looks sad & ashamed, takes her pants off... 2 goddamn bruises the size of my galaxy 4 on her thigh and calf... really??

I don't know what to do. 

Edit: Now that I think about it... The title should read ""I've had enough of it""... It is my problem."
Don't know if my friends like me,"There's actually a lot of stuff bothering me, but what's got me down right now is my friends. I'm a guy in Grade 11, and I've got a few good friends and several other kind of acquaintances. The thing is, over the summer, I haven't really spoken to any of my good friends. We usually play games every other night or so on Steam, but this summer was way different. To start off, I was away for two weeks at the beginning. When I got back, none of my friends were around. I'd text, message on Facebook, or try to talk to them on Steam, but nothing worked. I didn't want to alienate them by being annoying, so I stopped trying. The summer went on, and we didn't talk once. I didn't even get the chance, as they wouldn't be online when I was and still hadn't responded to anything I'd said earlier in the summer. Now, with two weeks left, I don't know what to do. I've considered talking to them, but I'm wondering if my persistence in trying to talk to them was what drove them away. I just really don't know what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated."
I can't afford my textbooks.,"I was recently accepted to ASU. My appointment with my advisor was today. She set up my schedule for me, and it's all online which helps a ton. The problem is I've been given three days to come up with a ton of money I don't have for textbooks that 1. are absolutely required because the course work is done from the book and 2. are exclusive to ASU so I can't buy them anywhere else and I can't find a place to download them. I'm freaking out, because I was all excited for going back to school, and now I might be completely screwed. I've emailed my advisor, but I highly doubt it'll do me any good.

As most of you may be aware, a lot of college students drink alcohol, and smoke marijuana. I do drink socially, but I haven't smoked in for many months now, but I would like to. But some circumstances lead to a lot of problems with my family, and forced me not to smoke anymore. I am fully aware that there is no *need* for me smoking weed, but I would like to as a social thing. Here's a little backstory:

Coming into college, I told myself not to drink or smoke weed. The first day I arrived for college, I went out with my roommate and we were looking for parties. I was a bit nervous, but after a half-hour of house-hopping, I had a shot of vodka, and I felt pretty okay with the idea, and quickly said ""I'll drink."" I still told myself that I wouldn't smoke weed, and I didn't until a few months later, when I got back home from college for Thanksgiving. I smoked my first bowl of weed at my friends house back home. I didn't get high, but I felt okay with trying it once. Come the beginning of winter quarter for the school year, and my friend brings back a jar of weed (an ounce). We bought a pipe to share, and me, my friend, and another friend down the hall smoked the weed for a good while. My friends throats burned from inhaling the smoke though, so we decided to invest in a vaporizer (Vapor Bros). At the time, the guys didn't have a lot of money on them. The vaporizer cost about $200 at the local smoke shop, and most other places that had it priced it a bit more expensive. So, I told my friends that I would withdraw the $200, and have them repay me later. I bought the vaporizer, and all was well. We would smoke a lot, but that quickly died down once the work started getting a bit heavier, but never enough to interfere with our class schedule and work-time. Our grades were fine, and the smoking was good. We bought a very nice ice water-pipe as well to cool the vapor even more. We had a great set-up, a good hook-up, and an all around good vibe, until my parents found out.

I was in my dorm room when I got a call from my father asking if I could Skype. He said it was very important, and sounded a bit frantic, and knowing my Dad, this must have been serious. I was thinking something terrible might have happened to one of our family members, so I got on to Skype as quickly as possible. I log onto Skype, and call them. They told me that they found a Facebook message I sent to my cousin. I originally asked him how I was doing, but then I started talking about how college was good, how I joined a fraternity, drank a lot, smoked a lot, and pretty much bragged about a bunch of stuff, and over-exaggerated a bunch of stuff as well to spice it up. I told him I was thinking about rolling (trying MDMA, or ecstasy) at a rave coming up, when I truly didn't want to, but I said it just to sound cool. He asked if I wanted to try shrooms, and I replied that I did, but same thing, I didn't want to. I just wanted to sound cool. All I liked to do, was smoke weed, and that was it. I really didn't drink much, in fact extremely little compared to a lot of college students. My parents found out because apparently, my Facebook was left on one of the computers they use. Keep in mind, I was gone from the house for a few months after they found out, and I hadn't used that computer since I left. They use that computer a bit, and they said they saw it left on, saw a picture of my cousin and his name, and wanted to see pictures of said cousin. They clicked on the message. 

So my parents find this message on my Facebook. My mother was in tears, and my father basically cussed every word in the book, and told me I was not going back to college next year. I was in tears as well, totally incoherent, and screaming. I wasn't sad at what I said on the message. I was sad that my parents seemed convinced I was a drug-addict, and I wasn't going to school next year. Right hand to God (even though I am an atheist), I had no intentions to trying any harder drugs other than marijuana. 

After a few months since they found out, they asked me what I actually spent the $200 on (we have a linked checking account where they could put money into my account when I need it, so they could check the deposits and withdrawals I made). I originally told them we bought speakers, but I confessed that I bought the vaporizer. They said I had to repay them back. At this point, they were still very mad and deeply saddened that I smoked weed, told my cousin that I was going to try harder drugs, and thought I was a drug-addict. But when they found out I lied about the $200, they felt even more betrayed. My friends repaid me, but they still took $200 out of money I earned, because my father felt I stole it from him, since he's the ""breadwinner."" 

My mother is extremely emotional, and very, very protective of me and my brother. She stays at home most of the time, and aches for when I get back to see her from college, since I live quite a distance to where my family lives. We are her world, and it's no surprise. My father loves me as well, but he is extremely moody. If something bothers him, it's a cancer to the whole house. We have to walk on eggshells with him. If his temper goes off, then get out of his way (he isn't violent in any way, he just screams, and is just an erupting volcano). He works a lot as well, and is one of the bosses of a large firm as well. 

I talked to some my family members about it, and they said my parents overreacted. I agreed. I am ashamed I did lie about the vaporizer, but it isn't atypical to smoke weed, or sound tough to your peers. But they were more mad about me lying to them about the vaporizer. But come a few months later, and my mom is now terrified I am going to die from a drug overdoes (keep in mind I haven't smoked weed for a good 5 months, and when I was it was pretty much every other day, a bowl and thats it). She says she can't sleep because she thinks she's going to wake up to a call from the school that I was found dead. Yes, I exaggerated about the harder drugs, and yes I am sorry I did that, but I would never do that again. She didn't believe me; however, things quieted down, and she began to open her eyes, and see I had changed.

I went to my cousin's house (the cousins I talk about here is not the cousin my parents found the Facebook message from), because her parents (my aunt and uncle) were out of town. Her being 21, she invited a lot of her friends to drink. My other cousin who lives with her (her little brother) has Fedal Alcohol Syndrome. I would never allow him to drink (for obvious reasons), but I felt smoking weed wouldn't be all that bad. Their parents were out of time, and so were their neighbors. The younger cousin tells me that the neighbors who are out of town have some weed. The neighbors told my cousins to watch the house, so they gave them the keys. So, I said sure, why not. We go in, find some weed, he gets high, and crashes on his bed at home. I drink a little that night, he walks around high and what not, and it's all fun. No biggie. The next day when I come back home, my mother wants to go on a walk with me. She tells me that my cousin (the 21 year old) told her parents (my aunt and uncle) that I drank, and my younger cousin smoked weed, because she felt guilty from hiding that. I think she did the right thing though, now that I look back at it. My mother told me this, and began to cry. She thought I learned my lesson with drugs, and since I was supposed to be a role model for my younger cousin, and him having a predisposed vulnerability to drugs and alcohol due to complications with his mother when he was in the womb (he is adopted), and me knowing he was vulnerable. This is where things changed. My aunt got everything out of him. My younger cousin told her everything I told them. I said I was going to smoke weed when I got back to college, try all these drugs, and what not, and rage like no other. I told him this, while I was in college when I came to visit, and before I stopped. My aunt on the other hand, pleads to my mom that I am drug-addicted, and am going down the wrong path. My mom says I have to see a therapist, or problems will arise. I had not smoked weed for 5 months at this point, and I just simply said the things about trying other drugs to sound cool. 

Everything is better now. I am still fixing ""broken"" ties with my aunt and cousins, and I am going to therapy, which has helped me a lot. But, I still want to smoke weed. I would not do it every day, I would only do it occasionally. I found no problems with it. But what's keeping me from doing that is that if I do, I might feel immense regret and shame because I told them I would never do it again. Therapy, and a lot of rebuilding trust went into fixing my relationship with my mother and father, and I would feel a good amount of guilt if I smoked again, knowing I am lying to them again, and throwing everything back in their face again, not to mention if they somehow found out, I would be *history*. But at the same time, I would know exactly what I am getting in to, and would never EVER try anything harder than weed.

The prospect of living at home while going to college instead of living on campus is really bothering me...,"So I am just finished Secondary School (High School) and I am about to find out on Wednesday if I got a place in college next year. Just to clarify for those who don't live in Ireland, when you are applying for colleges in Ireland, you don't just apply for the college, but also the specific course you want to do in that college (e.g. Civil Engineering, Environmental Science etc...) and you then go for four years learning everything related to the course you picked. It is not like the U.S where you pick your college and then decide what major you would like some time after you get in.

After lots of thinking I decided I would like to ""major"" in Astrophysics and that required picking a course in a college where I would not be able to commute from daily, because it is so far away (Dublin, which I live 150 miles from), and I would have to live on campus. Unfortunately my family would not be able to pay me to live away from home. I tried applying for a student loan and a government grant but I was denied both requests. So I decided in the week before the closing date for applications (around the end of June) since there was no way I would be able to afford to go to Dublin and do Astrophysics there that I would apply to my local University (University of Limerick or U.L for short), and then give myself the summer to think things through and decide for sure what I would do. The problem with U.L is that it does not have any specific course ""Astrophysics"", or really any Physics course that is purely science. The closest related course is called Applied Physics and that is the course that I applied for at the end of last June, but it is more engineering related then science related so I'm not even sure if it would be worth my time going there if it doesn't get me where I want to go.

The other Problem is that if I go to my local university I must live at home. It is the combination of problem number one, which is that I have to do a course which will probably not take me to Astrophysics and problem number two, that I may have to live at home for the next four years while commuting to college that is really bothering me. I live in a small village 30 minutes form the college, and I feel that If I don't live inside I will miss out on so much. I think /u/jadenray64's comment [HERE ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1h83c4/what_is_the_worst_permanent_life_decision_that/cartv86)sums up my thoughts on what it will be like living at home. There is really not much here for me in this village I live in, and although I love my family, my home and my village I feel as though I will begin to hate it if I live here for the next four years. 

I guess my options are to A, just go to college in U.L (A = last resort) or B take a gap year and try to save up some money so I can maybe go to college next year. I've done some calculations though and the money I can possibly save up in a year will only be a fraction of what I need to go and live in college. Couple that with the fact that If I do get a job it will be almost impossible to commute there as I don't have a car or a full license yet, it looks very unlikely that a job is possible but you never know either. Thank you for taking the time to read this, I really needed to get it off my chest.  I would appreciate any advice on what you think I should do, and if anyone knows any subreddits that you think would be a more suitable place to post this just let me know."
These stretch marks are bothering me.,"I've had all sorts of scars since about 12, and I've just now (few months) noticed them. I know some will disappear in a few years, but they ARE everywhere, under my funny bone, near my underarm, lower abdomen, crotch, and knees. Does anyone know any cheap, but really effective treatments for this that will usually work?"
"Still in love with my ex, and seeing her so happy with her new boyfriend is absolutely destroying me.","She broke up with me 3 months ago, became ""official"" 2 weeks later with her new boyfriend (who she met a month and a half prior to breaking up with me... while she was on vacation in the US Virgin Islands).

It absolutely destroys me to see the pictures she posts on facebook, especially the accompanying comments of ""he's perfect"" and how she ""finally found the right fit"" etc.
I still love her way too much, even after realizing that she was basically cheating on me (emotionally) with this guy for the last 1 1/2 months of our relationship. Even knowing that, I can't seem to let her go or move on from it. I haven't had any contact with her for 2 months now, and have deleted her #, texts, pictures, etc. I even deleted her off facebook almost immediately, but curiosity still gets the best of me every few weeks and I check out her page which has some stuff open to public view - that's how I'm seeing these pictures of the two of them together.

Anyway, there's a TON more to go along with all of that, but basically it has led me into a horrible spiral of depression that I can't claw my way out of no matter how hard I try. Some days are good, some bad, but it seems like there are WAYYYY more bad/""blah"" days than there are mediocre or ok days.

The worst part about it is that he lives halfway across the country (about 600 miles) from her (us), and she is somehow finding tons of time to go visit him (2 week trip this last time from what I heard), whereas she could hardly ever spend time with me when we were together. She was still in school when I was with her, so was extremely busy with homework and her numerous jobs... it just kills me to see her setting aside so much time for him (even though she's out of school now) when it was difficult to even find a day for me each week.


I wish I could talk to her and tell her how I feel - tell HIM how I feel, and that if he ever lays a finger on her I WILL make him regret it.

I know I should probably be mad at her for going behind my back and causing all this pain, but really, I care way too much about her and still love her, so can't force myself to be angry at her. Him, on the other hand........ he knew she was with me when they met, yet he still stayed in contact with her. I'm 99% sure he's the reason she broke up with me, but whatever.

Anyway, nobody wants to read it and nobody cares. I just needed to vent a little bit. There's too much fucking pain bottled up in me to want to deal with it anymore, so figured if I typed it out it might help. Guess I was wrong. Whatever."
My lover is travelling with his ex.,"I'm not sure how entitled I am to be upset, but I suppose that doesn't take away that I am upset.

Started a trip around the world, met a guy on a bus in Nepal. We ended up travelling for 2 months together, with not even a visit to the convenience store separated, and returned to our respective countries. I had a minor health issue that I wanted fixed, and he had to attend two weddings. We'll both set off again, not sure if together or apart.

He and his ex had broken up for about a year, it was really serious and he wasn't over it or ready to date again, which I understand. We didn't define our relationship, I liked him, I also saw his flaws which I felt made us quite incompatible for the long run. But I enjoyed his company, took it as a beautiful love affair and was fine with not needing to define a future. 

Absence makes the heart grow fonder, and while apart we text or Skype daily. It's nice because I never had someone who wanted to communicate so much with me. He surprised me by flying 8 hours to visit me for a week. But I know it wasn't me he was visiting; he needs to keep busy and have new, exciting stimuli all the time, and I think that's what I represented. I went to a meditation retreat for two weeks, and he decided to join his friend back home for a meditation retreat also.

I come back and call him, and it's beautiful, he's happy, wrote me a poem! He's busy and tells me he's leaving for London tonight and he won't really be able to chat until 5 days later. He tells me he met up with his ex to really get some closure, and they both agreed they aren't good together, and he feels good about it. He'll see her again in London.

He's honest. And he'll tell me things about his ex, if I ask. 

His car breaks down and the London trip is over, instead he goes to Belgium. Some things out of habit I see in what he's communicating to me, also he calls me all the time when he's alone and he's not doing. I remember how when he was travelling with me, his ex asked if he was alone, and he chose not to answer. I had been firm with him at the time, and telling him to be honest with whoever he's with and not to make empty promises or lead women on. Now it's my turn and I ask him if he's alone. And he chooses to not answer, and writes a long line of anything else. I know that his omission is admission.

I'm a bit hurt. Not angry. Hurt enough to create this throwaway and write this long text explanation. I wish he'd told me, as I was as supportive as I could be for him to be happy if it meant to reunite with his ex. And his visiting, telling me things were over, had me, unfortunately, making dreams and concessions in my mind.

He's texting me now a photo of the beach. And I'm feeling a bit bothered. How should I proceed?

**tl;dr:** My lover is travelling with his ex. What to do?"
I broke up with my girlfriend and I keep thinking about it,"So I had a pretty special relationship with my girlfriend. I really really love her and I think she does the same. But in the last month or so we had a lot of fights. She started getting pissed off on rather pathetic things, arguing that I say stupid stuff and when I was trying to explain that I did nothing and that she exaggerates, she stopped talking to me a while. And, well, I had enough at one point. I randomly sent her a short breakup text after 2 or 3 days of not talking and she was clearly taken by surprise. 

That happened 2 days ago. I tried to not think about it and just have fun with my buddies that I neglected a little bit, by I just couldn't. I keep thinking that that breakup was way too sudden and that we should have talk about it a little more. I really do love her and I think I did this just to raise a signal that I am here too and that I need affection from her. 

Sooo, any advice? What could one do? Should I just wait for a sign from her and if that doesn't come, just let her go, or should I act? 

Also, we are going at a festival from 14 to 19, and we will surely interact around there, but I don't know if waiting till then will be a good idea. 

Thanks! "
"My mother is going through a hard time, I don't know how to help or what to do","Some backstory: I'm 24 years old, I have a successful full time job.  I have had a girlfriend of 5 years and recently bought a house together.  Everything considered, my plate is pretty full, from a time and financial and stress aspect.

My mother was an excellent stay-at-home mom growing up, but her life has pretty much been shit since day one.  I'm no psychologist, but she is pretty emotionally scared and neurotic from the abuse she suffered growing up.  She met my dad (my dad is a great guy) and had me and decided to stay at home to raise me. They stayed together in a loveless relationship until I was ready to leave for college. She divorced my dad for a highschool sweatheart that dumped her to the curb a year later.  

Now that that's all out of the way:

She is terribly depressed all the time, she has trouble finding or keeping work at all.  She double majored in theology and english, so no prospects there.  Since she was a stay-at-home mom for so long, she is hugely out of touch with a professional career, and recently her job history can be described as spotty at best.  Shes been on unemployment for a while till that ran out, then she went to get her Masters in law (paralegal? idk) to do something.  Shes barely living off her financial aid and shes about to graduate into a field I fear is highly saturated already.  Shes 56 years old.

She is incredibly unhappy and usually calls me to cry on my shoulder since no one else is around to hear it.  I've been having her work for me to ""earn"" money so I feel like I'm not just giving it to her.  Thats about to run out though.

She often asks me to if it would be okay to just commit suicide, since her kids are the only things she has left to live for.  I obviously (not to mention its fucking difficult to hear regardless) say no. I cannot condone that.

Neither of us have the money to get her to a therapist or doctor.  I cant find her a job.  I can barely help her with her financials (food, rent) until she finds a job.  After that I have no clue whats goign to happen.  I'm really afraid she will either kill herself or end up homeless.

She is stuck in a bad rut and I feel like I cant offer much.  It's impossible to have a healthy relationship like this."
"I'm the bad guy. I've seriously hurt my friend's feelings, and this time I don't have any excuse","About a week ago I went to support my friend Anna when she performed poetry at a liberal arts loft. A lot of her friends, whom I knew and didn't know, also came to watch. She did really well. I, on the other hand, drank too much and was talking pretty loosely.

A few days later she's being super curt with me on facebook and refusing to go to anything I invite her out to. I ask my friend Brian and he says he knows she's upset about something, but assures me it's not me. A week later (today) I'm still suspicious, so he asks her again specifically and this is what she tells him:

""well he made a comment about Callum [her boyfriend] when I introduced them

hee bitched about my poetry performance in a non constructive way

he was a dick to my friends Dan and Erica""

I know I did do some of these things, and others I don't. I met her boyfriend Callum several months ago at a pub and when they were both out having a smoke, a friend of mine started making rude jokes about Callum behind his back, and I just went along with it. It seemed harmless at the time, but if he'd heard I'm sure he'd have been hurt and to be honest Callum seems like a really great guy.

I don't remember insulting her poetry. No, I wasn't black out drunk, I remember the night pretty well - I just don't remember ever saying those things, but I guess I did if she's heard about them. 

I don't know who Dan and Erica are. I spoke to Brian about it earlier tonight and he thinks they're a couple whom I borrowed a lighter off of outside. I don't remember ever being rude to them, nor does Brian nor any of the other people who were present - but that's neither here nor there.

I contacted Anna to apologise for anything, and she just didn't reply. My behaviour that night was clearly inexcusable. I'm totally disappointed in myself and ashamed of the way I acted. I want to use the excuse 'it wasn't me, it was the drink' - but what good is that? Whatever it was I said, I said it. Alcohol doesn't talk. I used my words and my words hurt people.

I didn't come here to soothe my conscience. I don't deserve to be made to feel better about acting so unacceptably. If I walk away from this without making reparations to those people I hurt, I've learned nothing and totally failed to better myself as a person. I'll remain the lout who totally ruined Anna's big performance.

I guess I'm just here to tell the story.

Names were changed."
UPDATE!!!,"I'm not going to bother linking the first few posts because lazy. 

I started me new (temp) job today! They called me about the position yesterday and I was like HELL YEA I'LL DO IT. It's only 3-4 weeks long assignment, but it'll be a huge help in getting my affairs in order for when I move out. Which is...in 2 weeks from now. (Thanks to a certain Redditor for the offer!) Also I've already made 2 sales on eBay; my PSP and my DS Lite. So that's another $XX dollars in my pocket for gas or granola bars or whatever else I need. 

Thanks again y'all for being all supportive and stuff. Now that we have these fancy new flairs I want you to abuse the hell out of mine so I can spread around some of the love I've been feeling here lately. :D "
Feeling.. weird,"It's my C/P from the http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1idrzr/whats_your_current_reason_for_being_unhappy/ thred where i got no answers yeah, anyway..

Oh, this is gona sound so pathetic and stupid, but i just have to share it, maybe i feel better....

The story is, i live in a small town in Bosnia, and here i didn't have much friends, i was born in Germany and moved here when i was little. I didn't know the language and i was always the freak in school. In Highschool things didn't changed much. Until i met her. She, a girl who i met in High school, she was one year older then me i started talking to her and we became good friends. She was kinda the onlyone who understood me. And so life passed.. She went to college, and I went to college in 2 different cities. She had a really bad period in Depressed because of private reasons, and was there for her I tried my best to help her.

The problem was i never really was beside her, i was talking over the phone with her and encouraged her to get on, to strive forward, and she eventually became happy again.

The problem is in the whole process i fell in love with her. I even told her and she replied that she doesn't want to change our relationship how it is, bcs she is like the kind of girl ""you can have my body but never my soul"" she is with a guy like 1-2 weeks uses him and breaks up with him.

She didn't wanted for me to be like one of those guys. now in the last couple of months we became distant.. She found some Boyfriend.

When I found out about it I felt devastated. I don't know why i just feel pain in my chest, like never before and i want to cry. I had other girlfriends too, i broke up with them they broke up with me and I didn't care that much honestly, but this is driving me crazy, im just sitting in my room trying to study and can't get a hold of myself. I feel really pathetic for having these feelings because of someone else, i sweared to myself that i Don't give a damn about other people who don't care about me..

I just feel completely overwhelmed.,"A few months ago my family and I were in an [accident](http://i.imgur.com/Ijujvq2.jpg). Our S.U.V., which had been a gift from my uncle, [rolled over](http://imgur.com/a/HgiRp) and I was [horribly injured](http://imgur.com/a/Ra2WQ#0) (warning some images potentially NSFL). Having found out upon calling my insurance co. to report the accident that my policy had in fact lapsed I found myself in a real bad situation and it has been a few months with no transportation.

Clarification as to how my insurance lapsed: Our policy began towards the end of Nov. when we received the vehicle from my uncle. I thought that my S.O. had paid the entire 6 months of the policy. We moved in the middle of Dec. For whatever reason (still not sure why) nothing from the ins. co. forwarded to the new address. My S.O. believed that I was paying the monthly bill., I thought it was paid, clusterfuck ensued.

No transportation means that I also can't get any follow-up medical care that I need for my head injury. I had an intraparenchymal hemorrhage and had to have reconstructive surgery done on my scalp to cover the  10 cm x 5 cm area where my skull was exposed. Right now it looks pretty lumpy and gross and scabby, I have no feeling at all in parts of it and extreme pain in other parts. I also still have nightmares and have a lot of trouble sleeping. I used to be a voracious reader, but can no longer read books, though I have worked my way back up to short stories and articles which is a huge improvement over a few months ago. I'm supposed to see a nueropsychologist in August to have my brain functions evaluated, but I figure that will be yet another appointment that will be cancelled without being rescheduled.

No transportation also means that my S.O. wasn't able get to work, he lost his job and has had no luck finding a new job within walking distance. With no income coming in the bills have been piling up. We had the water shut off 3 weeks ago and have to get water from a nearby spring for washing-up, cooking, flushing the toilet etc. Our landlord has been amazing and understanding through this but things have reached the point where he can't be understanding much longer.

The investigating officer upon interviewing me said things that completely contradict what he put in the police report. The skid marks at the scene in no way match up with the skid marks drawn on the police report. There were multiple witnesses at the scene who said that the other driver told them that her child had thrown something at her and she lost control of the car and she hit me, this is noted in the police report (at least it's noted that one witness said it, all other ""witnesses"" in the police report saw nothing at all). Yet the police report says that I sideswiped her. Her insurance company has not yet denied the claim, but they haven't done anything else yet either. I feel like my lawyer is barely even working for me at this point.

For comparison sake: [the other vehicle](http://i.imgur.com/5y1vxyV.jpg)

Meanwhile my entire life is falling apart, I am in tremendous amounts of pain and can't even go to the E.R. because I wouldn't be able to get home from there. I have been trapped inside my house since April, I had to explain to my child that we would have to live without running water for an indefinite amount of time, I know that worse is coming and I need to prepare myself for it.

I know that there really isn't anything that anyone can say to make this better or less overwhelming for me. I'm sick of being judged for it though and having people not believe me about it. I have a huge fucking crevice in my head, that's not something I'm going to lie about. Thank you anyone who took the time to read this.

TL;DR: Missing a chunk of my head and life fucking sucks.

Edit: Had to fix a few things because it read like it was written by someone with a head injury (yes I can still laugh at myself sometimes, thank goodness)

People disparaging people from commenting to people about their weight.,"I've always been too skinny, incapable of gaining weight and it's bothered me. People would always say ""Omg you're so skinny eat something ffs."" Or they would turn to my wife and be like ""Omg do you feed him wtf is wrong with you."" It was pretty simple to be like... Yeah I dunno fast metabolism I guess.

I quit smoking, quit drinking coffee and quit indulging in marijuana. I've gained like... I dunno 20lbs. Now everyone is like... ""Whoa you look good with those extra pounds."" And usually I respond with, ""Thank you."" 

It's 2020 now, we've endured a lot of flurries over the past few years. You know. Lots of snowflakes pouring in. I really think it's about time people realized intent. I'll give another example.

A lady I've known since she was 50 (like when I was born) is now in her 70's, the entire time I can remember she's been overweight. It's never bothered anybody but herself really because she's great and nobody is like..""Damn woman do you ever stop eating?"" She's constantly on diets with her left hand and eating chips by the bagful with her right. Nobody cares because that's her business. When she says ""OMG You're too thin."" and I would say ""Well I'm eating, doctor says I'm healthy, my BMI is good."" She would say ""Well you look unhealthy."" If I were to say maybe, ""haha you seen yourself lately?"" Those aren't compliments and it brings into question the intent of the situation.

If someone is genuinely giving you a compliment and you're going to be an ass and get defensive then YOU'RE an asshole , not them. If you can't tolerate people not knowing every single thing going on your head that doesn't make them insensitive it makes you insensitive and I think people should start realizing that most people have good intentions.

If you're so wrapped up in what's bothering you that you can't understand that people are just trying to be nice then you should work on that, not go after people for simply trying to compliment you. 

It's really interesting how people will lash out at someone with pure intentions but then defend people with misaligned intentions. It would be nice if we could start paying more attention to where comments are coming from and less of what they are. 

If someone were to say ""OMG you're so skinny."" I were to respond with, ""I know, I'm doing my best but I just can't pack em on for some reason."" They could simply say, ""Hey, your body is just built differently don't be so hard on yourself I'm sure you'll reach your goals.""

Or maybe... ""Hey, you've lost a lot of weight lately you look good."" and you were to say ""Yeah it wasn't intentional it's a tough time, I'd rather not talk about it."" they could say ""Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that, I hope things get better.""

You gonna shit on people for trying to be nice and you're going to isolate yourself from people who's intentions were never to hurt you."
just letting all my problems out,"am in my freshmen year of high school, since childhood I was bullied by pretty much everyone and got beat up a few times, this lead me to develop an inferiority complex. plus with many other family members that I deeply cared about died and I was left alone with no one to talk about my problems. I would sometimes arrive home feeling like absolute shit and I would cry in my room and only come out for basic things. I haven't had much luck getting a girlfriend either and this always has bothered me and can bring me to tears just thinking about it cause since childhood all I've ever wanted to feel loved and have someone to love back, to be with me and I feel hopeless and scared of dying alone. in 2016 the bullying finally stopped but I was still a bit of an outcast. in 2017 I finally managed to get a group of friends who, to this day am still with. despite this, I was always the butt of jokes and got pushed around by them but I didn't leave them because I had no one else and they knew this too and took advantage of that. I became depressed and would cry myself to sleep almost every night. after some time I finally had a small light of hope come to me, I developed a crush on a girl and do to my lack of social experience I would do many weird and cringey things to get her to notice me (thankfully I've learned how to interact with people properly). the one normal thing I did for her was a poem I wrote. I took an entire week to write it, to make it perfect. then I gave it to her, it turns out she had a boyfriend, I was heartbroken and also felt ashamed of myself. I felt hopeless like no one would ever love me. my friends made fun of me for that it got so bad that one day I attempted suicide. failed. am not glad I failed, but neither would I want to do that again.my parents are religious and they think mental illness is stupid and that even if I killed myself I would still be a sinner in the eyes of God. my parents are not abusive thankfully, they are just ignorant I suppose, but it still hurt to hear that not even god cared about my problems. and by the way, I am male so my father telling me to ""man up"" is a bit of a problem.2018 was quite calm, my depression calmed down, my friends started to respect me more, not much but still something. I would often cry about past events though.now in late 2019, my first year of high school began, I made friends with this girl, she was by far the nicest anyone had ever treated me, she suffers from depression and anxiety and so we would relate to many of each other's problems. I have become close to her and also a bit attached. I deeply care about her and do everything to try and comfort her when she's down. it turned out she has a boyfriend but I have recently reached the point of loving her. I am desperate for what to do, I have never felt this close to anyone before. a week ago she revealed to me that she was only nice to me she felt bad for me, she told me that she does care about me but I am not that important to her. I don't know how to feel about this, I feel like I've been lied to and it makes me sad that she also will most likely never feel the way I feel for her. thinking about this has made me fall back into another depression, I feel desperate, I love her and I don't know what to do.

I simply wanted to let all of this off my chest after keeping it in for so long. sorry for any grammar or any errors I've made, English is not my native language. I didn't know how to word some things but I hope everyone can understand what I've written. please don't make fun of any error, am already uncomfortable enough sharing this."
Something that shouldn't piss me off,"I never wrote in this subreddit before so i hope i fit the rules, but anyway I'm, really pissed off with the modern memes community, i feel like all the memes are like this

self esteem issues at work over small things,"I was recently hired to a place recommended by one of my family members who also works there. Today, I just started training (computer based), I finished it early, and had literally nothing to do, so I went to my boss for further instructions, he said he was busy so he directed me to go to my sister, which was the family member who works there, she's a manager. It was supposedly awkward and not ethical, there's a rule against that, but we still proceeded. I went to her, she commented that it was awkward and weird, but still directed me to do this and do that, I went and did the job, and felt so out of place and was like ""wtf am I doing here?"", a customer came up to me and asked for help, I literally have 0 clue about the job yet and fucked up my answer and the customer got slightly upset, then later after my break, I was directed again to go do another job, several customers came up to me again and asked for help, I literally don't know the answer and always had to deny their requests, and my voice was just so weak, it just felt so shitty, I also messed up placing some stuff in the wrong area and another boss scolded me a bit in front of my sister, and she also personally scolded me saying ""you need to do something"", ""you're not doing anything"", and then another co-worker complained about me, and my sister had to tell the co-worker that I'm new and is a family member as an excuse. Also as silly as this might sound, I passed by several mirrors, and I had a look at myself, and just had these negative implied thoughts to myself, like ""look at you, you're such a failure"", ""you look so hate-able"".

Overall, I just felt so useless, and my ego was constantly being bashed, even though these were just small criticism and I am new, so it's expected, but still, I suddenly felt like everybody in the workplace just hated me, out to get me, etc. What made it worse is my sister had high hopes for me, since everything went very smooth prior to today, I just felt like I led her down. By myself, I was confident and doing pretty good with the training, and didn't get into any conflicts at all, she always asked me how was work, and my answer was always that it was smooth and everything was good, after today, it all just changed, my mood and feeling towards the workplace went from something I really am looking forward to doing, to now wanting to quit and avoid having to deal with issues and disappointing co-workers and customers, and I can also definitely sense some negative feelings coming from my sister after today."
I lost a lot of Money this Year,"I am from morroco and i just lost a sum of 1320$ i am a student and i bought a laptop for 850 i used it for like 8 month and know it s broken and i can't fix , i really need it right now , and last month i got scammed for 470$ .
i dont feel alright and i feel like i am losing my future for some boxes the world we are living at is really hard sorry for this but i needed to take this of my chest ...."
Why do they just remake everything.,Party of five? Oh but this time it’s a Spanish family. Make something new. Assholes.
I went no contact with my family and it hurts knowing that I probably won’t have a good relationship with them,"Long history of abuse and controlling behavior from my family. I would have panic attacks at seeing a text message from my parents, and it got way worse around the holidays with them constantly asking me to come out and see them. And I couldn’t handle it anymore, so i cut contact and changed my information. Decided to stop letting the anxiety from then rule my life. 

And it sucks almost as much. They’re gone now, and I wouldn’t say I miss them because all I can think about is what they put me through. But despite planning to do this for years, it’s so much harder than I thought it would be. I am so sad that they’re gone for real now and I won’t get to have a real family. It wasn’t going to happen, realistically. But now the slim hope of it is gone."
The internal monsters,"Im a 19 yr old male who has so much insecurities 
the first one is my teeth the front two are buck and the rest are crooked however they are  relatively normal clean (i tell myself maybe cleanisees can substitute for their imperfection),another of my inecurities is one of my fingernail is bad like only a part of it,im so ashamed of showing it in publicand now after 3yrs i finally seen this girl who im atracted to and i want to get to know her but my insecurites stop me from apporaching her.I hate these things about me and i cant try to have a relationship if i dont even love myself"
I don't know how to stop,"I hate that I like making fun of people. 
I hate that I can't stop myself from mocking people. And I just don't know if I'm just going through a really bad rough spot or I'm just really fucking mentally broken. I really can't feel like I can live without making fun of people. Like I don't know what else to say. I really wanna stop and start living life without feeling the need to mock someone. Is there something wrong with me? Or am in just a bad person."
All I see is my hands,"I feel weird because all I do is look at my hands, i just stare at them and I sink into this pool of thoughts that only relate to my existence. like how I am here right now and everything is happening and I’m essentially experiencing nothing and it’s all so quick. I was coloring in first grade and now I’m 19 and my heart is racing because tomorrow I’ll be forty and in a week I’ll be dead and not know it, never knowing I was ever alive but you’ll be there driving past my grave living your life and I’ll be a tomb in the corner of your eye that will only ever be the background stroke in an infinite painting. I know that while I glide across the canvass now soon my stroke with cease and one day another soles paint will brush over me and when the world looks at yesterday’s portrait They’ll never know I was the color purple, and I’ll only ever be the texture for someone else’s green. I think about when forever ends, because its only for existence and one day my existence will end and while I know what that will be like, when I think about it it scares me. I’m I love, I’m a son, an employee, I’m a thousand things to the world and one day I’ll be nothing, not even a mind in a dream limbo I’ll just be nothingness. I don’t know how to stop looking at my hands. Every wrinkle and scratch, each movement and pulse, I’ll always only ever see my hands and life will never notice they were there, I wanna forget I exist and just exist, I just wanna stop looking at my hands.."
Wanting something that'll never happen.,So there's this girl I talk to sometimes and whenever I do it seems like for just that split moment of me talking to her my troubles and pain goes away. I really wish I could tell her this and everything but between the significant age gap and the fact she's dating someone right now I know it'll destroy any friendship we have. I know I have to let it be but being single for so long I just want someone like her that can do what she does. I feel crazy for thinking about this so much but I don't know what else to do besides just not think about it.
"Girlfriend trouble, but not serious?","I've been with this girl for about a year now. I really want to tell her how much she means to me, but I simply cant. Whenever I have anxiety attacks, she always sits there and tells me it's ok. She'll message me throughout the day ""You got this!"" And stuff like that. She is really amazing and I'm scared that whatever I say wont ever be enough to truly explain to her how much she means to me, so I don't. I keep closing myself off and it's kind if frustrating. Is there anything I could do to tell her that I love and care about her, without her thinking that I'm just trying to pass it off as not caring or being lazy? I dont want to lose this one."
"I'm having my vestibular system removed/destroyed in both ears tomorrow, and I'm worried since I read an article saying you need vestibular hair cells to breathe. Is this true?","19, female, hispanic, 5'3'' 115 lb .

I have meniere's so i get extremely bad dizzy spells. i opted to have my vestibular system in both ears removed, but since the referral for surgery i accidentally came across a news article saying how you need vestibular hair cells to be able to breathe during sleep. the scientist's name was Reubens and he said the hair cells in your vestibular part of the ear detect CO2 and tell your body to breathe and if both vestibulars in the ear are damaged, there will be no or very little response to CO2, and he said people with damaged vestibular hair cells could stop breathing in their sleep. this worried me a lot. the study was done on mice but a review said the experiment also damaged the mice's brains so i am unsure if it was damage to the brains causing the results of the study or chemical removal of their vestibular system.

a follow up paper said mice with damaged ears lost 60% of their respiratory drive to CO2, meaning 60% of the cells responsible for telling the body to breathe were gone."
Lately I've been feeling so awkward when going out in public.,I get insecure and scared. I get the feeling of being nervous. People intimidate me. I feel less than others.
I hate my class,"So in my school, the classes are split. This wouldn't be a problem if the teachers didn't put every single annoying 8th grader in the same class. Basically everyone except for 2 people (my only two friends in my class) are annoying. Every single person just talks and talks and talks all the fucking time. Teacher talking and you want to learn? Well too bad, I'm going to talk all the fucking time during the lesson. Sometime they're even yelling across the class to their friend to tell them a stupid joke. I get headaches during every single lesson because it's so loud and it makes me so god damn tired after every single day. They also almost always pick on a single kid because he has said some regrettable things. Sure, he's kinda weird, but it's not to the extent they ramp it up to be.

Tl:Dr: I hate my class because they're alwatlys talking and picking on one single kid."
My mom thinks I won't be able to keep a job because I changed hobbies,"So last night my parents asked where we prefer they move for retirement and I told them they need to move wherever works best for them. They said what if I'm still living with them and I said ""what, you guys are moving within the next two years?"" And they said ""no probably in eight years."" These people think I'm gonna be living with them in 8 years?! I already have plans to move out after community college (lucky enough that they're letting me live at home), or maybe even while I'm in it (depending on when I get hired as a sheriff service officer since it takes at least nine months).

I tell them all this and my mom says ""well you change your mind a lot so."" I said that's for hobbies and she's like ""well you don't wanna do orchestra anymore so."" I said that's a hobby and having a job would be different. She said ""you can't quit a job right away just cuz it feels awkward or something."" I said that I'm quitting orchestra next semester because I'm *burnt out* from my former *passion* which is why I'm not gonna have my passion be my job so I don't get burnt out and want to quit or be miserable anyway or whatever. Plus I'm doing orchestra for the rest of the semester anyway and I do/have done other things I didn't wanna do anyway so why wouldn't I do that with a job?

She thinks that because I don't wanna do violin or orchestra anymore that means I won't be able to keep a job ever and I'll be living with my parents for *eight years* because of it. Wow. Ignore all the shit I'm doing to be more responsible and be able to live on my own and provide for myself, and pay attention to my fucking hobbies instead (she also brought up ASL cuz I was super into it at first but not anymore).

Then she brought up I wanted to be a musician but not anymore, and I told her I decided not to cuz it's not as realistic and I probably won't be able to support myself that way (on top of losing passion and stuff) so I decided something else. I dropped an unrealistic career for a more realistic career, but since I changed at all that means I won't be able to keep a job.

My dad was on my side luckily. He said that I'm right about a job not being a passion and just being something cool. He also said that an SSO is a good job. Being supportive and encouraging basically, instead of doubtful like my mom. I'm finally starting to get a solid and reasonable idea of my future and it feels like she's trying to tear me down.

I hate how my mom thinks I can't even move out of the house because my hobbies change. When I still did violin she had no second thoughts on anything,  I ditch violin and suddenly I'm gonna move out of state with them in 8 years still living with them and probably unemployed. Unbelievable."
How do you make friends with people that you have no similar interests with?,It's been a while since I started going to a new school and I haven't been able to make friends. Most of my classmates are into sports and are actually quite popular at school but I'm more of an introvert and like to stay indoors. A lot of the time it's just small talk about school work and that's about it. How do I make friends?
"We’re together, but I’m confused.","So I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 3 months,  she’s head over heels about me, at least she was.... it wasn’t until the past few weeks I’ve noticed a change in everything, the way she’s text, talked, body language. She finally told me she’s still stuck on her Ex and she doesn’t know what to do, she’s struggling with us, she’s said she doesn’t want to hurt me at all, she really likes me, she thinks we’re meant for each other and everything, but she’s saying this stuff.... I’m very confused and hurt, we’re still together right now, but she goes back to school in about two weeks and she told me when she gets down there she’ll finally be able to really think about us. I don’t really want to lose her, I really like her, I just really really hope we’ll be okay. Sorry for the long post, I like Reddit’s community and I thought they could help/talk to me."
I found some articles from events that happened when I was in school.,"Article One: My primary school teacher was killed shortly after I left to go to high school.

The article was published five years ago but seeing it just felt weird. I remember going back to the school in year 7 to pick my brother up and she wasn't in her usual place outside the doors of the year 5-6 classrooms. My aunt was good friends with one of the teachers, who could tell something was wrong and tried to help.

Article Two: One of the year 11 students jumped from the top floor balcony when I was in year 9.

One of my best friends was in the building at that time - about five minutes before I arrived - and she saw it happen. The school went into lockdown and classes continued like normal after two hours but everyone was hysterical and refused to do anything. Most of us ended up sitting in classrooms listening to people screaming and crying about what happened. His sister had to be taken out of her lesson and sit in the office for a while. No one got sent home but no one really had lessons that day, either. The year 11 student did live past the event but I don't know what happened to him after we both left high school.

I don't know, I just saw the articles again today and it felt weird reading them again since I knew both of those people and I'd talked to them or seen them around."
I am very insecure/depressed about my body and I hate myself because of it,"I hate that I'm below average in everything. I have smaller hands, smaller feet and I am shorter than the average man.. I even have smaller hands than women. And this insecurity I have makes me want to kill myself. I just hate being insecure all the time. Especially when I'm out in public. I just automatically compare myself to others... Sometimes I have to go hide somewhere and start crying and it makes me feel so pathetic and stupid. I even cry myself to sleep sometimes because of it. I've had this insecurity for like 10 years. I've always hated the way I look. And today I just feel I feel that I can't take it anymore. I've had suicide thoughts for two weeks now and I know that I'm going to do it. Just have to find the courage..."
How can I accept the life that awaits me?,"This is gonna be awfully long, I understand if you don't want to read this. You can scroll ahead.

&#x200B;

I like to think I'm aware of what's waiting for me ahead. I'm 22, I dropped out of school, I've never worked and I've been isolating myself for the past 5 years... there's no way I'll have a decent life.

&#x200B;

I say isolate, but that's not entirely true.

&#x200B;

I live with my family and I don't have a room so I'm alone only in the bathroom. I even go outside with a friend, even if it is only 5 or 6 times a year, attend the local cosplay con once a year and go to my father's for some days twice a year.

&#x200B;

The fact is, I can't even show how I feel for one moment. I can't be honest with my family so I'm faking happiness, without even doing it right, and that's kinda tiring. 

I could be honest with my friend, but she has a lot of problem of her own so I don't wanna burden her with mine, she can't even help me so I'd just make her worry.

At the con and with my father is even worse. I don't really know how to approach people, so I kinda have created a fake personality to exhibit in such occasions, but people try to befriend me and I'm not strong enough to stop them so I just let myself be dragged... after the con reality hits back, I lose contact with those I met and feel incredibly shitty about myself as a result, thus my self hate keeps growing.

&#x200B;

As for my father, I've piled up a huge number of lies and the only way to not make everything crumble is to keep lying... I do feel bad doing it to my father but there's no way back, I even told him I graduated from high school! As things stand now, I can't go and casually say I've told him a bunch of bullshit for years and that my life is actually shit but I'm fully aware that one day everything will be destroyed...

&#x200B;

The solution to all my problems, even partly those with my father, is far too known to me: go out and work.

&#x200B;

Sadly in my country even to clean the stairs they want an high school degree, that cuts me off from about 90% of the jobs, and that's just the least of my problems.

&#x200B;

I'm paralized by fear, so there's no way I can just go out and work. I'm scared of changing the fragile balance that's created in my house and, since what I'm afraid the most is confrontation with other people, the only thought of doing something that's different from my usual routine terrifies me.

&#x200B;

The other problem I have is that I can't bear the thought of spending my life doing something I hate. I know I'll never have my dream job and that I'm far too miserable and ugly to find a lover, but if i leave those out what's left?

In the best case I'll get a job I'll hate that makes me scrape through life until retirement, when I'll be too tired and empty to do anything but wait for death quietly.

In the most realistic scenario I'm just gonna have to nurse my relatives all my life and live off their money like a parasyte.

&#x200B;

The fear problem is gonna solve itself, for better or worse, in a few months when I'll move in another city and my family will kick my ass towards employement, and since I'm a spineless coward, I'm gonna quietly obey.

The other one still remains though, how can I accept the shitty life that awaits me? I've already crushed my dream, suffocated my hopes and negated my wishes, but it worked only partly and didn't even resolve a thing, it just hurts a lot.

&#x200B;

I'm gonna ask all those of you that have experienced life more than me, is there a way to accept life? Am I just automatically stop thinking about it while working my ass off? Should I keep destroying myself by exposing me to all that stuff I've been avoiding because it hurts until I'm an empty shell? (By the way, the last one is what I'm currently doing)

&#x200B;

Before you reply therapy or something similar, that's not an option. That would man face my family and there's no way I can do it. Online therapy also isn't an option, as I said before I can't really hide stuff in my house, even for writing this I had to leave another browser page in background to switch to.

&#x200B;

If you fear I might commit suicide don't worry. I am depressed and suicidal, but I'm not gonna end my suffering to make more people suffer, I'd rather keep the pain for myself.

Thanks for staying with me for this gigantic rant, kudos for your patience. I usually don't say how I feel online, as it makes me feel like I'm looking for somebody to pity me and that makes me hate myself even more, but since life's gonna hit me soon I thought I might've asked for once."
My dad is a fat-shamer,"Title says it all. We were eating at a restaurant and an ample couple sat next to us. My dad just gave a look over and didn't say anything. By the way, my dad is a little *cough cough* on the overweight side. When we were leaving he said ""Did you see the couple next to us? They're so overweight."" I overreacted a little and said ""Excuse me? That's so rude of you!"" He responded,""Can't I say what I want? This is America (eye roll)"" I said back,"" How would you feel if someone else called you fat and shamed you?"" He said ""I'd slap them."" I responded,"" Great, why don't I slap you?"" My mom was there and said,""Hey, stop it. Control yourself (to me)"" I was really pissed (at him) and overstepped my boundaries. I'm often ashamed of my body, so this was like an indirect slap in the face. He is a republican and tbh I nearly 100% disagree with him on basically everything, political or not. I refused to talk to him the rest of the night. God, this really ticks me off. My dad has a lot of problems, but this shouldn't be one of them."
"School is hard, man.","I'm an English major, currently a junior. You see, I've always been very good at school. I kinda just costed through and got A's. Well, this year has kicked my butt. I used to think getting anything less than an A was the end of the world, but lately I've been of the mind set that C's get degrees lol. I'm just worried that the papers I'm working on now are not even C worthy, but I really am trying my best. At this point it feels like I'm kinda winging it and my connections between my research and my own thoughts are a bit of a stretch. I'm slightly worried about failing because I don't want to have to do another semester or two of school to make up for classes, you know? I'm trying my best and I just don't know if its good enough anymore.

Just wanted to express my woes and maybe someone will relate. Thanks for reading."
I was dumped,"I was just dumped by my girlfriend last night, and I don't know what to do. ""I can't really say I'm in love with you"" is what she said. This just came out of nowhere and I feel like I can't breathe. The day before yesterday I thought we were still madly in love, now I'm heartbroken. 

&#x200B;

I just wish I knew what went wrong. I wish she would tell me that I did something wrong, tell me that I fucked up, tell me I had abhorrent personality traits, at least then I could make \*some\* sense of it. But she just said that she changed, and no longer felt the way she used to. She loves me but she's not \*in love\* with me anymore. How am I supposed to react to that? How can you say you love me on Sunday, then no longer be capable of loving me on Friday? She keeps insisting that I didn't do anything at all, that she wanted to feel it but couldn't; but how am I supposed to understand that? I'm just hurt and confused.

&#x200B;

She stopped by my house last night to return some things I left in her apartment, one of my shirts she had (she kept the other one, and this one still smells like her 😢 ); and what really stings is that she returned the presents I gave her for Valentines this year. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I spent all night crying, I feel empty, like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. 

&#x200B;

It's like I'm trapped in a nightmare I can't wake up from. Whenever I was with her all of my depression and anxiety just melted away. Despite all the bullshit I deal with on a daily basis, I always felt alright, because I knew that no matter what happened I had her beside me, and she made everything alright. I honestly don't know how I'm gonna make it through the rest of the year.

&#x200B;

The worst part is how nonchalant she was. She seemed just so apathetic about it. Our relationship was amazing, we've been through so many good times, and I was always there for her when she was going through rough times, and she was there for me. But when dumping me she was so casual though, like we had only been on three dates. We were together for a year, and she didn't even seem to care. She said she doesn't see us having a future together; I saw us potentially getting married one day, I definitely saw a future with her. And she used to see one with me, I just don't know what changed.

&#x200B;

I don't know how to deal with this. Without her I just feel dead inside. Just last week I was so happy, now I don't know how I'm gonna live without her. She was the best thing that ever happened to me, now I feel like my heart is shattered in a million pieces. She said she doesn't think she was the right girl for me, but we were perfect together. I don't think I could ever find anyone else as amazing as her.

&#x200B;

The only one I feel like I can turn to at this moment is my best friend. They try to be sympathetic, but they're more of a tough love kind of person, they tell me to put my dating profile back online right away, right now; but I'm a crying mess right now, and I don't feel ready to try to date again. "
My SO has no friends.,"My SO moved to my city to get married about 2 years ago. They're an incredibly charming, social, smart, cool person. But they've been very stubborn about making an effort to make their own friends and it's starting to affect me. 

Every couple has their spats and needs to talk shit to someone else, and the only friend they have is MY best friend. To be fair, she's awesome and is a great friend to both of us, but she's told me directly that she is primarily my friend first (from before I even met SO). I don't want to have her keep being in the middle, because my SO doesn't have any friends for themselves after being here 2 years. We get into a spat, we both start bitching at her about the other person.

I try to encourage my SO to participate in clubs and organizations since we live in a big city and there are plenty, but they get defensive and angry when I bring it up. I don't want to drag them to clubs I think they'll like because it'll inevitably end up with me having more friends and them with half-friends. I don't know how to get my SO to really, truly understand why they need their own fucking friends."
"I don't really have any friends I can truly rely on, and my best friend ditched me","Ever since my best friend got a girlfriend 3 years ago, I feel like I've been kind of tossed to the side and have been a side thought for a long time. My fiance is still there for me which is nice but we work on opposite schedules so I don't get to spend very much time with him and the rest of the time I'm pretty much by myself. 

My friends don't really reach out to me and I'm always the one having to reach out to them, I'm not really that close with my family, and I just really wish I had a person. 

My best friend was my person, and now his girlfriend doesn't like me and so we don't hangout often and he doesn't really reach out or call unless I do. On the TV shows you see these people who have these friends that are there for them, and I just don't have that anymore. I miss having a person. 

One example is when I bought my house me and my fiance did everything ourselves. My best friend came and helped for 2 hours which is fine but no one else offered or cared to help. Now this friends moving and our entire ""friend"" group  is gonna go help and I feel jealous. He still has those friends and those relationships and I've got far less. He's unaffected by this and him and his girlfriend get to go off and be happy as shit and I'm left for shit. 


I'm not normally depressed or sad and I'm very happy with most of my life and I do have some very special and important people that I am lucky to have, but this has just been at the back of my mind for so long. Thank you to anyone who reads this, you're a kind soul for taking the time to. "
My friend killed himself and in one of our last conversations I was kind of rude,"We would talk pretty often and I did like the guy. He would just say really cryptic long winded things and it would get frustrating cause he's clearly talking over your head intentionally. One of the last things he said, which apparently he sent to other friends too, was that one of his problems over the past few years was ""slurping first order desires while as opposed to second and third level and mixing them dirtily with feelings without consistently using a refocus mechanism in the moment to returning to using the brain to think"". 

He was a good writer and I kiiiind of know what he means but mostly not. It's an example of where he will use undefined terms and a conversation with him can be just everything he says requires more questions before any meaningful response can be generated. I told him if you want to talk I'm here, but that I was getting tired of nonsense stuff. It was kind of rude and maybe I was one of the last people he felt okay sharing things with and I sort of rejected him slightly. 

I actually felt that way though and I'm not always nice to my friends. It just took so much effort to parse through the messages, run on jam packed sentences and difficult ideas, using abstract terms, using words outside their definition.. It was really exhausting just to understand and respond and I said something like 'frankly I'm getting tired of fielding this crap'. Very upset that I gave into the emotion and framed it like that, discouraging him from talking with me.

I don't think anyone is always sunshine to their friends, you kind of miss out on opportunities to help your friends if you are always positive as a rule it just didn't feel natural. Well after that conversation he said a few things which I didn't have a response immediately to. Fast forward a few days later I send him a video he never sees. Two days later I find out he is gone.

The lesson is definitely not lost on me that you never know where someone is at and things can affect people in ways you don't expect. I don't think that this was a major reason obviously but it sure didn't help to kind of tell him to stop sending nonsensical stuff. That's how I felt though. The other kind of conversation we had I was cool with. He was a funny guy and very creative but took some things seriously and wasn't really set up for stability. I don't know what happened but I think he killed himself. 

About a year or two ago when some people from our home town bullied him with this video mocking him he took it really seriously and went on a hunger strike. I talked with him and went to his house, we talked about life and I brought him to a restaurant where he did eat some soup and break the strike. Since then we talked about exercise and stuff online, and he came over once and played smash bros. We were all positive mainly, I was never rude except for that one time, but he was getting more cryptic and weird and I was not feeling it and didn't know he was feeling like that."
I can't stop crying,"My girlfriend of 3.5 years broke up with me a little over a month ago. I thought I was fine cause after a couple weeks I had stopped being sad for myself. 

But yesterday it all started up again. And now I just can not stop crying  and I don't know why. 

I'm a complete mess. 

I want her back so badly but she's moved on and it wasn't a very healthy relationship. But I was happy with her. 

I know I'll feel better eventually but it doesn't feel like it right now. Things I used to enjoy no longer entertain me at all. It just feels like I'm trying to rip off a bandaid that's super glued to my skin. 

I'm reconnecting with old friends but that's not really what I need right now. I just want to move and and stop being sad."
"Everything feels awful, and I’m not really sure why","Sorry if I start rambling in this post. I have a lot I need to say, and I don’t know exactly where I’m going with this.

I’ve been feeling perpetually sad for a while now, and I feel like I don’t have the right to be. I have a nice life. I have people who support me. Income isn’t great, but it is good. Yet every day I feel completely drained of happiness, and I don’t know what to do about it.

I have a lot of inspiration for things I would love to do, but I don’t have the motivation to take the necessary steps to actually achieve those goals. It’s been leaving me desperate and wanting for something that I don’t feel I’ll ever reach, and I don’t know how to turn that attitude around.

I feel alone. I’m terrified of talking to people outside of my family and the few close friends I have, and even then, I am still nervous about some of the things I say. There are some things I love, one in particular that I don’t want to say, that are completely harmless, but I can’t talk about because I still feel some embarrassment towards letting them know so much about me.

My brain feels like an emotional mess. With those things that I can’t talk to people about, and I can’t find anyone in person who shares those same interests without specifically announcing it myself, it all just feels built up in my head, and it keeps weighing me down, and yet I am to nervous to talk about it anonymously or in person.

I feel like I have no true direction. Although I don’t like where I currently am, I don’t know where I want to be that would be realistic. I want to be a part of something, but I don’t know what I want to be a part of. I just feel like it’s all completely hopeless, and that I will ultimately be forgotten in the future, no matter what I accomplish.

Nobody really likes me outside of my close group of friends. More than anything, I probably just get lost in a sea of background characters in other people’s lives, just trying to carry on while other people have something that they actually feel like chasing.

It feels like there is just a hole in my head, and all of my thoughts get lost in there. I have a multitude of thoughts, but it’s all a mess, and whenever I try to reach in there and get something out, it makes little to no sense, and it keeps me from actually being able to talk to people about anything.

I don’t want to be a burden on others. My biggest fear is that people only treat me okay because they feel obligated to, not because they actually like me. I don’t want to cause other people pain or discomfort, and I always try to please as many people on each side as possible, but it also results in me being the last person I take into consideration for these things, and it is really starting to hurt.

My life feels like it’s made up more of distractions than actual choices. I will constantly be doing something simple to help ignore and suppress how awful I feel and how awful I am, and they are honestly one of the main things that has been keeping me going outside of my involvement with a group that I’m so embarrassed about that I won’t even talk about it anonymously over the internet, even though it is one of the main sources of happiness in my life.

I feel like I’m dying, and that I have already accepted my death, and that I’m not doing anything to prevent it, as I have completely given up on life. I don’t feel suicidal, but I do constantly wonder how people would react if I died.

Although everything seems stable, it feels like my life is falling apart, and I don’t care enough to stop it. I feel broken, awful, unlikable, lonely, disappointing, directionless, meaningless, etc... and I feel bad for feeling these things, and zi feel bad for how others will feel about it. What the hell is wrong with me?

Sorry for the long post, and sorry if some of it isn’t described well. There’s a lot of this that I honestly don’t know how to explain myself. Sorry."
Mental day off?,"I honestly don't even know how to start or how to explain at all but I'll try.

I've been struggling with depression, anxiety and ocd for as long as I can remember. Over the years I've stopped going to therapy and stopped taking medication due to financial reasons. But the past few months have been getting quite rough for me mentally. I know I need help, but until I can afford it again I just have to keep my head above water but it's difficult. 

My long term relationship is taking some hits as I'm struggling to figure out my issues, and at work I recently got a promotion so that's a lot of extra pressure on me, and I'm struggling to keep up. I know it's not difficult work, I just feel mentally so exhausted that I can't get myself to do a thing. And I've been thinking of asking for a personal day so I can get some rest. But in all honesty I'm scared shitless. 

I struggle to talk about these things in person, so I don't know what to do. I want to ask for a day off before I mess up my relationship or work. And I can't afford either right now. I just feel so hopeless and powerless. I simply don't know which way to turn anymore..."
My ex is a whore,That's really it. Angelina is a whore who uses people. I hope she's always unhappy. I do not wish her well. Fuck her.
I have no hope that I can survive in society.,"Yesterday, my mother admitted to me that if she had the power to have me put down peacefully like a family pet, she would do it.

I turn 26 in a few months.

I am hyper sensitive. I get easily drained by very insignificant actions. Things like going to my therapist take less than 3 hours out of my day but leave me feeling unable to do anything for a day afterwards. I also suffer from very bad allergies. My room has to be kept as a clean room, no clothing or bodies that are not washed or showered are allowed in. When guests visit, I have to be sure I sit in MY spot, or else them sitting with outside clothes in the place I normally sit will cause me to have sneezing, itchy and painful throat, and clogged sinuses which often leads to infections. 

When I worked a 15 hour a week job, I became so drained both physically and mentally that I could no longer keep my relationship healthy. I lost contact with every nearby friend I had. I ate only boxed meals because I had no energy to make anything healthier. I no longer enjoyed gaming or writing, two hobbies that normally distract from my depression. I would get home from work and make my food and sleep, or watch YouTube until I could sleep.

My entire life is a burden. A huge financial burden. I am keeping my mother and sister from being able to save for their retirements.

I have to earn money and live on my own eventually, but doing so will only cause me to no longer enjoy anything in my life. But not earning money makes me a burden and puts me into a depression because I'm burdening everyone around me and I am only alive for three reasons.

1- I am terrified of death.

2- The people who care about me don't want me to die.

3- I am greedy and have things I want to see or experience.

I don't have any hope that I will ever be able to live a normal life. I don't think I will ever have a job that doesn't take over my entire existence and cause me to be depressed. But I also know I will continue to be depressed because I'm actively harming the people who care about me.

I want to help people. I want to create things that make others lives worth living. But I know, statistically, I won't ever be able to obtain a living doing anything remotely like that and even if I did, it would drain me into depression regardless.

I wish I believed anything could change. But I stopped believing in that years ago. Every time I leave the house or even Skype call a friend... After its over I just have this instinctual gut feeling of, ""thank the universe that is over. I never want to do that again."" But I always do. Because everyone says I need to leave the house and have friends. But how many times do I have to slam my face into the brick wall before others will acknowledge the brick wall exists for me and they just can't see it?

But then there ARE some rare times where I enjoy things. 

But it's like fucking gambling. I've lived for 25 solid years and I can think of all the times I've been happy with my life... And it adds up to maybe 2 to 3 years of it. 

What if I live another 25 and that number stays consistent? Is 50 years worth living if I can only look back on 5-6 years of that and say I was happy? 

I feel like I should quit now while the ratio is slightly more likely to be less dismal. I'm terrified that is only going to get worse. I'm going to live till I'm 100 somehow and the number of years worth living for will still be only 8 or so.

I don't know what to do. I'm so tired all the time. Tired of crying. Tired of trying so hard for things that others do like it's nothing. "
Anxiety feels like drowning,"It always sneaks up on me-anxiety and depression that is. I try not to expect it because it's like always waiting for the other shoe to drop but it often sneaks up on me when I'm not expecting it. Usually it's after I've had a really amazing time out with my friends that I feel at my most prone for attack. Anxiety and depression often tagteam me with thoughts of worthlessness, exhaustion, and paranoia. Often times the paranoia is whether or not my friends hate me, whether or not they wish I was gone, and whether or not I am worthy of any real love. This time the issue is  compounded by missing an ex who was ultimately a pretty shit boyfriend. I could feel the tendrils of anxiety and depression  sneaking up on me wrapping around my throat pulling me down. You're worthless your friends hate you they put up with you -your dads right about you. On an intellectual level I know none of that is really true but intellect doesn't really factor into depression.  I'm so tired of trying to be strong and tired of feeling weak. I feel like I'm hurtling headlong into an abyss of  a breakdown and I can't slow it down and I can't stop it. I miss being loved and feeling companionship I feel like I'm always worrying about never being loved. I just feel really alone and afraid and I don't know if this is the right place for this but I would love to feel like I'm a part of something and that someone really does care. I'm really sick of hearing that I'll find the right one and that he's out  there and I don't need a man. I just miss feeling loved. "
Didn't get into my major and my shitty roommate did,"At my college, we apply to/declare our majors in our second year of college so the first two years are spent trying to get the prerequisites for your future major. I wanted to major in something that you had to apply to so I knew their was a risk of getting rejected but I was still very passionate about it. The major is a global studies major, so it involves a lot of sensitivity and an open mind. The problem is that my shitty roommate also wanted to apply. My roommate is very rude and self-centered. She's very set in her ways which are usually offensive. She's also very lazy and if we are taking the same class, I usually get the better grade. Not only is she just really not my cup of tea but she's also racist and has said racist remarks about me (I'm hispanic). My first year was a little rough and my GPA was less than stellar. Fast forward to the beginning of my second year and I've raised my GPA but not by a lot because it was low to begin with. My roommate also has a shitty GPA but is taking easier classes. Spring semester comes and we both apply to the major. We both get our rejections within the same week. Then a couple of days later, she gets an acceptance letter saying that the program let more people in. I wait a week and still do not get an acceptance. Now I've been depressed for like two weeks and I don't know how to feel better. "
Excluded,"My friend who I play games with online a bunch recently came out as queer, and despite their normally upstanding character, they started lying about how their party is full when it shows an open spot. They've also been playing games with people they met through the queer discord, which I totally support. But it feels like they are playing games with them and I'm not allowed to join because I'm straight.

I don't want to bring it up to them because it's a really fragile time, but I feel rejected. Skilled or noob, gay or straight, I would never exclude someone when I have room for more, so I don't really get it. It's not like I was demanding to be put in their voice chat lobby or get in the way. They were already getting paired with 1 random team mate from matchmaking anyways, so I feel bad that they'd literally rather play with anyone but me. I also realize how selfish this is which is why I'm venting here instead of whining to them."
"Left my weed in friend's car, now his parents froze his card and took away his license.",I made a woops and now my friend gets punished for it. I feel sorta guilty but I don't really know what to do with these feelings.
I am afraid,"Recently my apartment blew after someone left a bomb at the sub level, I was lucky and I survived with minor injuries, however when the police were clearing up the room, they found me and thought I was the bomber, they beat me up, they were around twenty people, it went on for a long time,  afterwards they took me to prison and found out I was an innocent bystander, they let me go. My body has healed but my mental state has not improved, I cant stop thinking about that day, I cant stop thinking about the fact that the people meant to protect me were the ones who violated me, I cant stop thinking if people in general are good, am also very afraid of the future, will this happen again, how can I not end up in the same situation. Am also thinking about suicide as a way to just end it all. "
my friend had to cancel on our Saturday plans.,I don't really have anything left to look forward to.
Unsure,"Everything is trivial. I have no interest in anything no matter how hard I try. I am in a constant loop, everyday ghosting around with no meaning. I do not remember life before this. I have never had a mental connection with anyone, and cannot tell if this bothers me. I feel heavy. I feel light."
I came up short 32 dollars over the last two days at work,"I work at Jack at the Box (maybe not after tomorrow) and somehow I came up short 19 dollars on Saturday and today (Monday) I came up short 13 dollars and I'm so worried about being fired and I'm probably rightly so. I even received a note today saying I was short 19 on Saturday and that at any time the company may terminate my employment. I just learned that at the end of my shift and then, I came up short 13.


A lot of my plans rely on me having this job and having a steady income. I feel so depressed and frustrated. I almost cried when I realized I might be fired. I'm going in the morning to talk to my manager but it isn't a guarantee that I'll have a job. Fuck."
A birthday that wasn't,"My birthday passed a few minutes back. Nobody wished, except mom. Even dad forgot... Now I'm crying. I just worked all day. Downloaded a movie and watched it alone. Now I think I'm about to start crying... But that's not just today. 

For my 9th or 10th birthday, I thought today is my birthday, I'm going to be happy for the whole day and at least today my sister won't abuse me. But she did... I then told myself, when I grow up, I'll be happy. I failed to do something so simple, be happy. "
My boyfriend of one year just confessed that I am not sexually appealing to him.,"I'm a 24 year old male and he's a 19 year old male. We've been together for a year now. 

December he cheated on me and admitted that I was not giving him the amount of sex he desires. In February I tested my testosterone and the levels were quite low. I went on clomid to help raise my levels of testosterone and it tripped it, however it didn't increase my sex drive. I am investigating this further. 

So we have been talking about a possible third to add to our relationship to help with his desires. This past Friday someone came over and I was not prepared for what happened next. 

We started drinking a little bit and my boyfriend started complementing him in ways I've never been complemented. It progressed to the point where all 3 of us were in my bed and my boyfriend started to give this guy a blow job, which I was completely ok with. Then I noticed that they wanted to move beyond that. That's the point where I couldn't take it and said that they should not go any further, just stop. 

They listened but I was still hurting, for one I was not getting any attention, and the second thing is that my boyfriend didn't understand why I stopped him. This other guy left shortly after I told them to stop. 

Once we were alone I asked him why does he want a third person so badly, and that's when he told me that I wasn't sexually attractive for him. I broke down crying. All my insecurities that I kept bottled up were confirmed by the one person who I truly love. 

He has assured me that it's just for sex and that I am everything he wants in a person, except for my body. And he truly loves me. 

I don't know what to do next... "
Money and family.,I have debt thanks to my parents who really haven't helped me at all and only seem to mess me up more. Most of my struggles are just paying for school even though I got a part time job. And honestly I just want to move out asap.
Today's my 21st birthday and I'm totally depressed.,"As bad as they were I'm going to miss the development years when things are malleable and you're at your physical peak.

I feel like I don't have an identity beyond being a developing young'un, and it hasn't hit until now that I don't have that option any longer.

I suppose I also feel like it's too soon to be this old. It's going to be just a few years until I'm 25, then just a few years until I'm 30, etc. Yes, I don't feel young at all."
I failed my driver's test for the third time at 20 years old. My god I'm pathetic.,"The first time it all went well but then he had me park next to the kerb and back up, and I drove over the kerb.
The second time, I'd only had three hours sleep because I just wasn't tired the night before, so I made mistake after mistake.
The third time, I automatically failed right away because of nerves. I didn't register that the examiner told me to turn right away, and I jerked into the turning lane and almost hit another car.

Yes I know I failed for a reason, but MY GOD, I'm almost 21 years old. And it's going to be a whole four months before I can try again. I'm so tired of being immobilised by my own incompetence that I can't seem to get out of."
I doubt myself too much.,"Hi.

I'm not sure if anyone else has ever felt this feeling but I suppose it has to do something with my low self esteem. For some reason I can't help but feel insecure about my relationships with my friends. I find myself doubting why people want to associate with me. Probably because I've been alone for such a long time, growing up, that I'm not used to this or perhaps it's because I don't understand, but..

I doubt myself at every turn. I don't want to. I want to believe that people want to hang out with me, but there's that voice in the back of my head that keeps going ""Why?"". I don't think I'm fun, in fact I think I'm rather cringey. I think I'm annoying.

I don't know, it's depressing me lately and I'd love to just believe but for some reason I can't.

It's tearing me up inside. Worse off, at the end of the day I feel like I'm not even needed.

I'm really not. I'm just a placeholder until people get bored. I fail to be interesting or show any knowledge of anything other than video games. I have a hard time picking up on things and am very slow mentally entirely. It's hard to not think that people are just being with me out of pity.

It hurts."
I lost my dream job,"Hey guys I got fired from my dream job yesterday. I was working in a music store fixing guitars and doing quality control, apparently I'm not experienced enough in fixing them that they feel comfortable to let me do it and they feel that taking the time to teach me as I go would take too much time for them. I don't know I was hoping I could get some advice, maybe you guys can help me feel better."
Our engagement is leading us to misery.,"I pray that next year when the ball drops, I not be as miserable as I have been these past three months. 

My fiancé left me last fall. He returned a week later, and we've been working on our relationship for the past three months. 

I was fully on board with marrying him before this went down - hell, I proposed. But since he returned, I have not been the same. I've been less tolerant of him walking over me. I've been standing up for myself. I cared about myself as much as I cared about him. 

The thought of even setting a year to get married in is enough to throw me into a tailspin. Reddit, I love him, but I cannot marry him. I'm 22, been with him for three years and nothing good has come of my sacrificing for him. I paid 80% of the bills and set my life for him for him to utter blow it all up in my face... and make me realize that I can do better. 

I have come to the realization to say ""yes"" to him is to say ""no"" to a hypothetical other (or if I'd stay single, then a ""no"" to Me Myself and I).

I'm horrified of what would happen if I ended our relationship for good. I love his family, and his family loves me. My family loves him too. My family has experienced separations a million times worse than this... but I'm putting myself on an unrealistic pedestal. I want the perfect carefree life... but that's not life. Life is hard choices. 

Reddit, I'm terrified. I want to wake up tomorrow in a different life. So far away from here. I need help making an adult decision when I'm barely an adult. Help me help myself. "
"Pretty sure I have depression, not sure what to do about it.","First off: sorry about the wall of text. I tried to organize it a little bit so similar issues are near each other and it flows a little bit, but it's almost 3 am and I've been awake for 18 hours on 4 hours of sleep.

Just to preface this with a little bit about myself: I'm 23, in my sixth year of college and what should be my last year of engineering school. I grew up in an upper-middle class family. My parents pay for my rent, school, car insurance, gas, and cell phone. I had an internship over the summer and they liked my work enough that they're letting me work part time from school (about 10 hours away; they gave me a laptop and I connect remotely). Not sure if any of that is relevant, but it just makes me feel like I have no reason to be depressed, which just makes me feel worse.

For the last year or so, but especially since September, I've been having a lot of trouble with just about everything. I have no motivation to do anything. There are things I want to do, but when I finally get around to doing them, I don't enjoy myself, and quit. The only thing I seem to actually enjoy is when I get a chance to go out with friends, but even then, I'm worrying about the things I should be doing. There are even times I wont go out when I get the chance because I know I have something important I have to do, but I know I won't be able to muster up the effort required to actually do it. I'm essentially doing none of my homework (one assignment per class, per week - easily several hours per assignment). One of the classes I'm in is being offered for the last time this semester and I don't know what will happen if I don't pass. Everybody is expecting me to graduate in May, and I don't know if it will happen. I just want to be done with school, but I can't make myself put forth enough effort to pass any of my classes. I would love to talk to my family about it, but they don't seem to care. If I get a bad grade, all I hear from my parents is things along the lines of ""We know you can do better"" ""Are you talking to your professors and getting help"" and ""Are you still going to graduate on time."" I would talk to my professors, but when I actually do manage to do my homework, I procrastinate so much that there's no time for me to go see them. I was a straight A student through high school and got a 28 on my ACT so they expect me to be a straight A student in college. I mentioned that I was planning to stay at school and take one last class over the summer, and my parents' reaction was asking if I could take the class in the spring semester because they want to stop paying rent. I understand what they're doing for me is expensive, but there's no inquiry of why I'm taking a summer class. Even though I'm so close to finishing, I really just want to take time off of school and figure out my life.

My mom is also obsessed with losing weight. She lost a bunch of weight a few years ago and still complains about being fat (for the record, at this point she is probably underweight), but that's an issue she has to worry about. What bothers me about it is that she's always pushing me to lose weight. I want to lose weight, but I barely have the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. At one point she said if I hit 250 lbs she would take me to get some form of weight loss surgery. I understand that she wants me to be healthy and live a long time, but the way she goes about it just makes me feel like a fat piece of shit.

And if that doesn't kill my self-esteem and confidence enough, I've never had a girlfriend, or even been on an actual date. One girl kissed me at a party once and I obsessed over that for a week. I have plenty of female friends, and I have no more problems talking to girls than I do guys, but I either can't read the signs when a girl is into me, or they just don't seem to be into me. I feel like part of my problem is that I suck at/hate small talk, but I'm so self-conscious about everything that I can't seem to carry a conversation unless I'm really comfortable with the person I'm talking to.

I seem to spend all of my time on Reddit, Netflix, or both. I used to love reading and video games, but now I get bored within a few minutes. The only game I seem to be able to play for extended periods is Fallout 4, but even that gets boring after an hour unless my friend is on Teamspeak with me. I remember when I was playing Fallout 3 and New Vegas I would just get sucked in and play all day and have a blast. I miss being able to do that. 

I feel like I don't have anyone I can actually talk to about my life. I tell my friends the ""fun"" stuff, but I seem to pretend that if I don't talk about what I'm really dealing with, it doesn't exist. It works great for evenings out, but it's not working long term. 

This post took me an hour to type when I really should be working on a lab report that's due in 5 hours. I haven't started, and the reports for this lab class take longer than that to get a passing grade on. At this point I'm just going to sleep for those 5 hours and force myself to go to class. It just all feels so pointless, especially this late in the semester."
I didn't get tested,"This is a throw away account,

My ex gf cheated on me and I never got tested after that. I've been with my current gf for 2 years and we have never gotten tested while with each other. She's only ever had one previous boyfriend and they were only ever with each other. 

She has a doctors appointment coming up and we are both afraid of the Doctor, I told her last night about me not getting checked and she's been crying ever since. I'm an idiot and I feel like dying. I can't believe I was so careless and irresponsible. I don't know what to say or how to fix it. 

What if I have something and gave it to her? The first time I have an actual relationship that was working. I don't know how to feel or how to console her. I think it's over and I don't want it to be..."
I'm fucking useless and I need to die,"I go to work, I try to make friends I try to talk to people, I try to get girls interested in me. I'm just so fucking unattractive, pathetic and I'm not interesting enough for anyone to give a fuck about what I have to say. I'm just a boring fucking piece if shit. 

Yaya someone's talking to me and I'm having a conversation but not without me saying something really fucking awkward! 

I'm useless and socially inadequate. No one will ever want to spend the rest of their life with me. No one will ever love who I am, no one cares who I am, I'm nobody and it's always going to be that way. 

My fucking family members don't even listen to what I have to say! I have to say things over and over, what I say doesn't matter, what I believe doesn't matter. I'm close minded to them. 

I'll always be unattractive and awkward, no one will ever truly care.

I fucking suck.

Attractive people get everything in life and I'm not attractive. I spam likes on Tinder and rarely get any matches. I'm fucking pathetic."
I don't think I can afford college this year.,"Uni starts back at the end of the month. We were bad at getting financial aid the info they needed so I think that's part of why my financial aid package this year isn't enough. I could take out loans, but I have over 20k in loans already. I've sat around like a loser for almost four months, and have accomplished nothing when I could have at least been earning some money. This would be my senior year. I won't get to graduate with my friends. I know it's stupid, but 2017 is an ugly number and I don't want such an ugly number to be my graduation year.  
I have to make a decision, because I still don't have housing figured out. Or employment, health insurance, etc. Even if my dad worked 40 extra hours per month to meet the payments, last year was a real struggle. So I could end up costing him like 22k just to fail everything.  
I just want to curl up into a ball until everything goes away."
A girl I went to high school with is getting divorced.,"It's weird but I remember when they met almost 15 years ago, when we were in 10th grade. They got married a while years back, and now they're getting divorced. I know no happy marriages end in divorce, but it's just so sad."
Long distance is hard,"I've been with her for about 2 years. It's a long distance relationship too, and we have yet to meet each other. And I want it to work out. But, it just seems like it won't. We've been fighting a lot recently. And we both decided it was because didn't Skype/facetime as much as last summer. Last summer we would be able to face time all night, and I really miss that. Now, the face times last 2 hours at most. I miss the time we would spend together. And I just feel like now I bother her if I want to spend more time face timing. It just fucking sucks and I hate it. And I feel so fucking clingy, I feel pathetic. I don't know, but it just sucks. 

Thanks for reading though guys!"
just had to cut lose my group of friends.,"nothing too serious, but my group of friends have always been different to me. small bits in common but whatever. i live in a small town and people who are tolerable are slim picking. i've had a group of friends for 5 years now and most of that i've been at uni. they never do anything for anyone else and tonight i wanted to go out, asked everyone and nothing. check instagram while with my best mate (for 20 years) and a photo of all them with #bestfriends . that's the last straw. problem is as a 22 year old who is already done with this town but stuck here for another year or so it's hard. i guess i just wanted to vent and hey, any internet friends would be cool haha"
I have a dance recital tomorrow & no one is coming to see me.,"Sorry this is so trivial, but I'm just feeling super bummed out right now.

My family's not coming, for reasons I'd rather not go into. We've just kind of been falling out lately.

The few friends I have all happened to have other stuff going on the same night.

I've been practicing for the past five months, and now I almost feel like there's no point in performing. I'm just so disappointed that I can't share one of things I love doing most with the people I love most.

Would love some encouraging/motivating words right now. <3"
Life is taking its toll on me as of late.,"For the last month my life has been on a sharp decline and honestly have no one to talk to about it. 

As of late April my sister totaled my Honda Civic leaving me with car loan that I have to finish paying for and no money to get another car. Thankfully my boss paid me for 2 weeks in advance for another car but with my credit being so bad I can't get an auto loan. 

I have my sister to co sign but that may not work since her credit isn't any better. 

With all that going on, the girl I had strong feelings for suddenly stopped talking to me a couple of days before the accident. I haven't spoken to her for about a month until last night where I reached out but that went nowhere. She replied a couple of times and stop replying back. 

Which hurts  I was there for her and all of her small time issues and I'm here with a serious unforeseen event happened to me and she nowhere in sight. I just wanted someone to ease this shitty situation that I find myself in. 

I feel I have no control with my life and everything is just going to shit. I have no girlfriend, no car and I'm carrying a lot of debt with an internship that barely paying me and on top of that im suffering from depression and can't talk to anyone about it. this is really taking a toll on my welL being. i don't know what to do to get my life back on track. "
Where the hell has my motivation gone ??? (Possibly struggling with depression),"In regards to the depression and before I launch into my rant, I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13 after suicide attempts and self-harming. I took medication for 6 months but haven't since. (Now 24...)

Last year, I was in New York, studying for my Master's degree. I had a part-time job, a social life, it was stressful, but I managed. I cleaned my apartment regularly, I cooked myself healthy dinners, I went to yoga once week. I liked my life, even if there times then that I wasn't so happy since I was away from my friends and family in Texas. 

This year, or at least since I got back to Texas in July 2014, I feel like my life has been a mess. Most of my friends didn't even notice I was back in the state, my parents decided that as soon as I found a job, they were going to move to Florida. I did end up finding a job, 40 minutes away from my hometown, to which my parents quickly rushed me into an apartment 10 min away from the job so they could move. Nobody comes up here, I hardly ever make the drive to see anyone. I work 9-6, usually later, Mon-Fri. A majority of my friends are working part-time jobs to fit with their university schedules and therefore aren't off on weekends.  

Because I end up working late, I usually eat something crappy for dinner, I don't take my time to cook, so I just throw together whatever (frozen food or the like). I don't do yoga anymore. I tried to get into running with coworkers during lunch, but ankles were burning since I haven't been doing physical activity of any kind. So I""ve stopped for the time being lest I hurt myself. My weight's gone up, my clothes aren't fitting right and I hate it.  

The icing on the cake is that I'm in love with someone who is over 5,000 miles away. I'm ecstatic he's visiting soon so I won't be alone and have someone to motivate me into being cleaner and cooking more. But I feel like I shouldn't have to rely on him to motivate me, since I did it all before... Sometimes I get angry with him because the quality of our video chats goes to shit, if I'm stressed out I'll lose my patience and take it out on him.  

Thanks to my year in New York, I have around 45k in debt. It's another source of anxiety for me, but I can't seem to stick to a budget. I've looked at personalfinance but I can't stay motivated or cut the impulse spending. I guess it doesn't help I changed my payment plan and the payment is lower so I think I can ""afford"" random stuff I probably don't need. 

So there it is... I guess I lost my motivation, I don't know what the fuck is going on my life anymore, but I know that I can't keep drifting about and making excuses. How the hell can I get my groove back?? "
I am too sad to eat.,"My boyfriend cheated on me with a girl who has repeatedly stolen 2 other of my boyfriends. He admitted to me and his sexual intentions with her.

I'm really upset.
Last week he gave me diet pills to help me lose weight.
This was before I found out.

I've been serious about fitness.
But I'm scared.


I'm so sad I don't even want to eat.
But I can't be left hungry.


I keep hearing that I'm strong and that girl and my now ex boyfriend are not worth it. But it's reaaally hard to see that.

Me not eating is just started last night.
Help?"
I get embarrassed when doing my hobbies around family members.,"Whenever I am home and working on my hobbies I tend to feel embarrassed. My main hobby right now is medieval reenactment. Recently I've been working on making armour for combat. 

My grandmother lives with me and my father visits recently. Whenever she or my father sees me working on anything (not just this hobby) they tend to look at me tilt and ask ""what are you doing"" in a tone that, to me, implies I'm doing something strange. 

They don't ever discuss my hobbies with me directly. They have a tendency to ask my brother questions about my interests. So, if it ever gets brought up, I feel really embarrassed talking about my interest and hobbies. 

How can I relax and just get on with my business without feeling like a weirdo? I have to sneak around whenever I'm working on stuff and it's really stressful, especially when I'm trying to do something I enjoy. "
I feel like a failure.,"I received an email last night, informing me my uni application had been rejected. I've been rejected from all three courses I applied for, and now I don't know what to do with myself.

The plan was that I'd move in with the boyfriend (who's currently living about 2 - 2 and a half hours away by train), go back to school for two years, qualify as a teacher. Get a job, get married, have a family. But now I'm not going back to school. And sure, I can apply again next year, but I don't want to have to add another year on to basically starting my life.

At the moment I'm working two part time jobs, while still living at home with parents and 17 year old sister. I'll be 26 next month and I just feel stuck. I don't really know what I want to do now, beyond move in with the boyfriend, but I can't do that until I have a job in his city and I don't even know what I want to do. 

My sister passed her driving test this morning - something else which I've also failed at. It's been several years since I failed, but I don't have the time or money to retake lessons again. I just...I don't really care so much about the driving, I hate driving, but I just feel like it's one more thing that I can't do.

On top of this, I woke up with a horrible head cold this morning, so as well as feeling like a failure, I'm also miserable and snotty."
life in general,"I grew up being told to get a career, focus on school don't worry about boys, there will be plenty of time for that later. Now it's later I'm 36 single, with a law degree and massive loans in a job I hate and now realizing I'm never going to get married and have children which at this point is all I want to do.  I look around at friends and family who ""screwed up"" got knocked up and they are all happy. "
I don't think he wants me anymore,"We've been together for more than a year, our first real and meaningful  relationship, it has had its ups and downs (like a normal relationship I suppose), but I know how important communication is, so we've always have found a way to fix our issues. I found so much love and comfort with him, like I never thought I could ever experience... this is why it's hurting me so much, I don't want it to be over.

The past few weeks I've been feeling that he somehow has been losing interest in me, I know I'm not perfect, but he isn't either, I've tried so hard to get his attention, but I don't know if I should even have to try this much. He doesn't seduce me anymore, he doesn't hug me from behind and kiss my neck anymore, he doesn't send me dirty pictures anymore, he doesn't say anything if I send him dirty pictures anymore... I'm 25, I have a boyfriend and I haven't had sex in a month, for one or more reasons we've seen each other very little this last month. So I stopped telling him how much I want him, because I expected that it would make him say he wants me.

He once tried to break up with me because I ""deserved someone better"", I told him I'm the one who decides what I deserve, that I deserved love and that I had that with him, so we stayed together.

Today he said we need to talk about us, that he would try to leave work early so we could talk; he wasn't able to leave work early, and since I have to make an hour long drive to his place and also wake up early in the morning for work, I told him I wouldn't go (this is a usual thing, he knows I can't visit him on weekdays if he doesn't leave work before 6pm). So we said ""fine"".

We've barely seen each other in two weeks, like we watched a movie past Friday and that's it. He said ""well let's see if maybe we can meet on Saturday "".... He knows I had planned to be with him the whole weekend. I asked why the 'maybe' if we hadn't seen each other in a long time and I wanted to see him, he just gave me a sad face emoticon... nothing else has been said.

I think he wants to end it, but I still love him, am I being clingy?, I want him, I don't want anyone else. I don't know if I should try to save this relationship for the second time, or if I should just let him make the decision and not try to make him reason anymore, should I just let it go even though I love him with all my heart?

I'm so scared of losing him forever, I'm scared of getting my heart ripped in pieces. I don't feel good."
Why can't I do it?,"She gave me the ultimatum: open relationship or break up. I love her. But for the past 3 years she has been changing from artist to hippy and she needs to ""be herself"". She doesn't want to break up but she's miserable not being able to have sex with other people.

Why does it bother me so much? Why can't I get over it? I'm an engineer, as logical as they come. But I can't get over this, despite the lack of logical rationale. 

I love every moment we spend together and I don't want to jeopardize that. But why does it make me so bitter? Why do I think things like  ""she just can't shut her legs"" and terrible slut shaming vocabulary?

Why can't I accept it. Why can't I be who I want to be."
I'm so lonely. I can't even imagine what my future will be like.,"[throwaway]

I'm a senior in college who turned 21 about 5 months ago. That seems crazy to me. The last 4 years have just been so lonely.

Back in high school, I used to hang out almost entirely with girls. These days, my few friends are guys, the list of girls that I can call friends is getting shorter and shorter. They've all moved away or gotten boyfriends or joined sororities, and don't want to hang out with guys like me anymore.

It seems like every girl I try to talk to just doesn't want anything to do with me. I think I'm an average looking guy, but in this college town it seems like every guy is extremely attractive, successful and outgoing, making me pathetic by comparison. The few girls I meet in class don't seem to want anything to do with me outside of class.

All I ever do with my friends is go to bars or parties, where my friends just try to find girls to hook up with. Every girl I try to talk to or dance with just turns me down. On the rare occasion that a girl seems interested in me, anything I do just ruins it. I'd almost rather just stay home, but then I'd have no social life at all. 

I'm not suicidal--I'm very passionate about my science and that gives me plenty to live for. But what if I'm not successful in the field? I'd be left with more debt than I dare to count, poverty, failure, and my loneliness. I think I can succeed and make an impact in my field, but there's definitely a chance that I might not--so I feel like I need something more.

The other night, I spent about 30 minutes making out with a girl that I did not find attractive in any way. Her friend asked me if I wanted to kiss her for new years, and I was like ""sure"". Everyone at the party was taking pictures and laughing at us. She really was quite gross. I felt really bad for her, and I feel really bad saying mean things like this, which is part of the reason that I let it happen. But mostly I let it happen because that was the most action I've gotten in years.

Last night, a couple of my friends almost ordered an escort, after having no luck at the bars. I was tempted to join. I wouldn't have done it, but I was definitely tempted.  I'm worried that I'll end up there in the not too distant future.

I really don't know what I can do, if anything. When I try to get out there and find a girl, I fail. And every time I fail, I become more hesitant to try again. I don't know what my life will be like a few years down the road, but if the trend continues, it'll be even lonelier than my life now.

I've posted this to a few different subs. Maybe somebody out there can help me. If you've read this far, then I really appreciate you listening. Thanks for whatever advice you can give, or if none, then thanks for your time and sympathy."
Lost,"So I have been in a depressed state for over a year now, I'm 23 and and I recently just dropped out of college to try and get my life together. My girlfriend and I broke up a little over a year ago and I can't seem to find the motivation to do anything anymore. For the first time in my life I was able to be completely comfortable with someone and be myself, no reservations. We dated for close to 3 years and I admit I wasn't the best boyfriend. I became too comfortable with my position in life at the time and had started to take her and other things in my life for granted. So she graduated in the spring of this year and ended up moving back home, about a 14 ish hour drive. Even though we broke up a year ago and she graduated this spring, we had been talking every day and hooking up still but she was also talking to another guy back home. So of course she ends up dating this guy as soon as she moves back home and I feel like absolute shit. They broke up after only a couple months of dating and we have still been talking on and off while they were dating because we were very close and shared a real connection. She says she loves me but she is scared for what could happen to us because of the situation we were in before and how it negatively affected both of us. And although I can't argue with her on that point because we ended on a stupid fight that was my mistake, I know in my heart that this is the girl that I am supposed to marry and I can't find the motivation to do anything anymore for myself. Nothing seems worth the effort to me anymore, I don't find humor in anything and I am overall just filled with regret day after day for over a year now. I've hooked up with other girls and hung out with friends more and done all the moving on advice, I have even gone to therapy for about 7-8 months and took the pills they gave me but it didn't seem to do anything for me. I felt like an emotionless zombie while I was taking the pills and no matter what I did that day I would always be lying in bed for a few hours thinking what could have been and what should have been if I wasn't such a shitty person and took advantage of the great opportunity I had in front of me. Now I don't even care what happens to me. My uncle committed suicide nearly 25 years ago and I don't think I could do that to my family and my Dad after what they have been through with all of that. So I have been talking to this girl a lot recently over the past month or so and she just got back together with her new boyfriend after breaking up with him less than a month ago. She talks about moving back down here when she has the money saved up in a few months because she doesn't enjoy living back in her hometown. And part of me believes her because we talk so much and I know she doesn't like it there from her job to her situation at home with her stepdad. She tells me she doesn't know what she wants from her new relationship with her ex boyfriend now that they are dating again but I know if she were to give us and me another chance, I could be everything and more she has ever wanted. It's just if I am not her everything, I might as well be nothing. And I know it sounds sad to feel like your happiness is so dependent on another person but I really haven't been happy my whole life. I remember in high school before I ever met this girl in college I got so drunk over spring break and locked myself in a bathroom threatening to kill myself. Honestly I don't consciously remember doing that but I know that there was probably a reason behind it and that these suicidal thoughts and depression were something that was ingrained in me without myself really knowing they were there. I just feel that I could get my life on track and make myself and my significant other so happy if she would just give me the chance. I don't know what else I can say to her that I already haven't to try and prove to her how serious I am about us and our relationship. She even went as far to say recently, while she just got back with her boyfriend, that she wants me to be the father of her children and spend the rest of our lives together because it is something I know we both deeply want and have talked about multiple times while we dated for 3 years. I just feel so lost and do not know what to do with my life, I feel I have the wits and capabilities to do anything this world offers me but I could not care less unless I am sharing my life with her. I know things are supposed to get better with time but every single night for over a year I think about her and just fill myself with regret for what I let slip away. I feel I don't deserve to live anymore because I haven't done anything significant with my life and I haven't thoroughly enjoyed anything for multiple months. Right now I am at the point where I have realized that not everybody can live a happy life and I will just be floating on feeling like shit until I eventually die one way or another. When you know nothing else will make you happy but you can't get the one thing in the world that will make you feel like you are worth something, what are you supposed to do with the rest of your life?

I found the love of my life but...,"Hey guys.. So.. Ya. I pretty much did IT. I found HER. Or we found each other. And it was so crazily random and.. Thats it?


Okay lets start at the beginning.


We met when we were 14. We had our ""confirmation"" (protestants, yay). We met us weekly because of the church. And then someday we actually got together.. But young as we were... Well. Nothing more than a few shy kisses and she ended it three weeks in or so. No biggy. We hated each other for a bit and then came closer as the end of our confirmation neared. We had fun, talked a lot... And then she had a boyfriend. I was pissed off and such.. But hey. We still talked but it was less and less and then we lost contact. 

Fast forward a few months. We are both 16 now. She breaks up with her boyfriend and contacts me. And.. We became really really really close. We told each other everything.. And in the summer when I was on vacations with my friends for a week she tells me...That she feels like we are soulmates. And I dunno. It just felt right.. And I really felt that way. As if we are connected. I come home after a week and we meet us and talk.. And two weeks later she has another guy. I dunno why and how and all that. But hey. Its her life. Maybe something physical only? We are really young...


We try to stay in contact but I cant stand to see her with her boyfriend so I write an epic wall of text and tell her to decide.. But she cant and wont. So I do it for her and break every contact. 


We get older. I get my first real girlfriend. Yay Sex yadda yadda. Occasionally I think of her and she tried to text me twice or so but I tell her to delete my number. early this year I feel like I will break up with my then GF pretty soon so.. I message her. She is excited and its like there was nothing. We talked and talked and talked. Then close to our A-levels I break up with my GF. Unrelated to her but it was the right thing to do.



However. We met and did some stuff.. And I never ask ""How is your love life?"". Which was fatal. One day.. I realised that she is still together with that guy. WELL. Thats fucked up but we still talk a lot.



Then the fatal things happened. On our prom.. She is there.. And we are both drunk.. And then we dance.. And kiss. And.. Talk. Like, a lot.. She tells me that she is just together with her boyfriend because they already paid their vacation and she cant take it back. So she is just waiting for the right moment. The next day we meet and kiss and cuddle and talk.. She talks to me as if I am her boyfriend and gives me ""advice"".. Because I so insecure about what we have I ask her if its an affaire or if we are together because I couldnt wrap my head around it.. And she answers the next day...
TLDR: She was drunk, it was a mistake. Yes we belong together but not like this. She loves her boyfriend. And we should probably take a long break.

But I cant. That was not right. She just fucked up our friendship and her relationship so... As a hurt 18-year-old boy would do I told her boyfriend what we ""had"" and drunk. All by myself. Just Jim Bean and me. It was horrible and noone should do that but hey. And this evening. She calls me. I told her absolutely brutal things. Fucked her completely up.. And then we both cried. We fucking cried for ages. Just sitting there on our phones and cried. And then laughed. And we had fun. Sent us funny pictures and videos. And talked about the past. The good old times.. And ended it pretty retarded. Her boyfriend didnt allow her to talk to me... But hey. In the end I stopped to text her but if she ever wanted to talk I would answer. Always.



She changed her number (unrelated) and we had a month long break. I really thought I was finally over her. You guys know ""500 Day of Summer""? Fucking best film out there. SPOILER: In the end he asks her why it never worked out. And she said it just hadnt made ""click"". And I thought, well fuck. Thats me right there. We were perfect. But it never made ""click"". And then 3 weeks ago I had birthday and she sends me a fucking letter with her new number and talks about some memories we share.. And I text her. Of course.. 


NOW: Im completely fucked. I am not over her. I never was. I lied to myself, to my best friend. To her. I cant stop thinking about her. She is the one. I know it. Whenever I feel bad or weird or just want to say SOMETHING, she is there... And she always will. But we are not together. We may never will. Who knows? Its not like she has to.. But I can never love anyone else. Yeah believe that its some childish shit.. No its not. Srsly. Its 5 years now and I lost many friends and got new ones. But this one constant was her. I changed in character the last few years but whenever I text her its just plain perfect. We just fit together so well. But it never made click...



Yesterday I had a fucking break down. Given, it was a lot of alcohol involved but only children and alc says the truth, right? I told one of my best friends.. But he couldnt help either. And today I told it my 2 closest friends and they were just quiet. Nothing. And she is there. Somewhere. Maybe sad maybe happy. But will we ever make it? Is it fucking retarded of me? Should I quit all and every contact again? ""Fight"" for her? Fuck up her life AGAIN?!


Sorry guys. Its a long story.. Thank you for your ear.


Und Eva, wenn du da draußen bist: Ich liebe dich. Das musste mal gesagt werden.."
This fucking cankersore.,"I used to get then more when I was younger. They crop up when my immune system is low, I'm stressed and/or I'm not getting enough sleep. This week has been a combination of all three. I can't seem to keep up with my shitty life. It sucks when I feel like I am just trying to tread water and the pond is full of sewage. I am applying Orajel every hour or so in hopes that this will go away soon because no sleep and yes stress are both here for the foreseeable future. "
"My crush is seeing someone else. It's not bad, but it still hurts.","Background: I'm a 19 year old male, studying at college.

I've met this awesome girl, let's call her Julie. Julie was good looking, fun, a nice person overall. I'd give her a 7/10. We started talking after she asked for my help during Programming class. It seemed like she was interested in me. We texted a lot, talked a lot, all that stuff.

Then she became colder and colder. She didn't talk to me with the same interest as before. Then Julie started talking to this other guy. ""No big deal"", I thought, ""she's just talking."" Then they started dating. 

The worst part about liking someone is when they don't like you back. Maybe I bored her, or maybe I was just misinterpreting her. But even worse than that is when they begin dating another person. EVEN worse is when both are in the same classes as you. You're forced to watch them kiss, hold hands, hug, be happy, while you're lonely and bitter because you don't have a girlfriend and never had one. It's like a psychological torture...

You know that one moment, where you walk out of the classroom, and see your crush and her bf kissing? It got me by surprise. It was a Monday, they started dating on Saturday. I walked outta the classroom, and saw they kissing. It's that moment when your heart stops for a second or two. A friend of mine described this feeling: ""It's like a guitar string snapping"".

And the same thing happened last year. First year of college, met another awesome gal, I'm gonna call her Mary . She was interested (I'm 100% sure of that), but due to my stupidness (and a small misunderstanding), Mary started hating me, and then began dating someone else. Of course, as time passed, she forgave me, and now we're good friends, though she is still dating the same dude.

I know that being bitter because of a girl sounds stupid. I'm not angry nor bothered by the situation, because I know it's my fault.

I got a friend who's been through a similar problem. Yesterday we talked about our failed love lifes, comforting each other. He then jokingly talked about becoming gay, because ""happiness is at the tip of a dick"".

That last part was unnecessary, but it was funny. Anyway, sorry for my rant and my poor grammar (English isn't my first language)."
My girlfriend and my views are changing,"I've been dating my girlfriend for about 3 years now, and we've always been generally interested in the same stuff. I'm 20 and she's 18 almost 19 and since she turned 18 she's been in a rush it seems to get all these tattoos and piercings and she moved out a week after she turned 18 because her mom has always been controlling. And I used to want all these pointless tattoos 2 years ago too but now I don't at all I only seem to want ones with great art and meaning not just get one to get it. And she has 5 or 6 already and keeps wanting to get more and I keep trying to tell her to wait and see if that's something she actually wants because they are permanent and she never listens. And now her friend has convinced her to get her nipples pierced and while its her body she can do what she wants I'm against the idea, but again its her choice. But I feel like we both just have completely different priorities and that I've grown out of that phase and she isn't going to and don't know what to do about it. Sorry for the wall of confusing text. "
I'm ruining my own life because I don't seem to care about my future anymore.,"I've always had a bit of a problem with procrastination. And I have ADHD on top of it.

College started out great. Made a lot of friends, got to learn cool things, etc. However, it has slowly but surely been getting worse and worse and worse, and it's entirely my own fault. I made mostly A's and B's my freshman year. But starting in sophomore year, I got more and more C's. My GPA within my major is horrible. 

All this because I can't seem to make myself do *anything* anymore. Even this very moment, I should be starting a take home exam I had a week to do, which is now a day late. An EXAM. I want to make good grades, I made fantastic grades in high school. But I just can't seem to make myself put in the effort...

This all has been taking a huuuuge toll on my self-esteem. I used to think of myself as smart, competent, and at least somewhat responsible. Now I'm sort of a worthless person. I can't study for shit, can't work for shit. I haven't had ADHD medication since the last semester of my freshman year, and I keep wondering if that has something to do with it. But I was never really that severe of a case, never needed anything but a tiny dose of medication. Do I want amphetamine to be the magic solution anyway? Am I that useless without drugs?

I'm sort of teetering on the edge of a breakdown. This is what I do. Pretend everything is okay until I can't ignore it anymore, then break down (dramatically). I'm sort of concluding that I must not care about my own future anymore, because I'm pretty much doing the opposite of anything that would help it. I can't see myself in the future, at all. I'm finding myself questioning how much of a future I want anyways..."
There they go.. jail again.,"If you want to know more you can ask. 

I've been trying to go out with a girl for a while (around two years.). For almost two months I was debating telling her how I felt, and I finally did Thursday night. At around 4 am, you know, so she'd wake up to the love note kinda thing. No response all day. I see her online on Facebook and I start to talk to her. Turns out it's her mom. She and her sister are in jail. Apparently they got into a fight (they like to wrestle each other)and they found ""Drug instruments (and weed bowl). Since they're adopted the parents said ""Fuck it, I don't want them."" So now they're in jail until they're 18. This isn't their first time in jail. One always runs away because her adoptive parents abuse her mentally, the other always gets in fights..

To compact it even further, I haven't eaten since Thursday since my ulcer gets worse with stress; I can't even hold down liquid. 

Oh, and I had a fight with my own family. To the extent that they threatened me with forcing me to live with my abusive dad if I went to go see them.. I'll give you five guesses which I chose.. so now I may never get to see them again.

But is that a bad thing? I mean would they even remember me or care about me after 487 days of no contact? Would they be the same people? Will I?

Teenage drama.. yay.

EDIT: Apparently the one guy I've been grieving with all night is going to jail too because one if the sisters ran away to his house."
I feel like there's nothing I can do.,"I don't know exactly what is wrong with me, but I haven't been feeling well since January.  I used to cry once, maybe twice a year.  Since January I've been crying myself to sleep almost every night.

I got out of my poor living situation.  I thought this would help greatly but it's the same problems, just better scenery.  I got a job I like over the summer, it helped greatly as it distracted me from my problems, but I don't have the time to work during the school term.

Some problems I've tried to fix, but they keep persisting.  I have no friends, so I tried to put myself out there.  I joined a couple clubs on campus, and went to some social groups organized over meetup.  I had a good time and met some people, but after a few months of this I've only managed to make more acquaintances.  I've tried talking to a school counselor, but I can only see him every 7 weeks because there's so much demand.  He recommended I see a therapist but it costs more than I can afford on a student budget.

I've tried to improve myself.  I don't want to be like this.  I feel like no matter what I do my problems can't be fixed."
Homecoming Date,"Homecoming is in a week and I bought two tickets hoping to ask a girl to go with me. I am really shy and awkward when it comes to people I like so I come off as such. The thing is I don't think she likes me, we talk but she seems like she is purposely trying to distance herself from me. I'm a hopeless romantic and I planned everything out perfectly in my head, but she already bought a ticket. Now I'm in an awkward situation, I am terrified of being rejected and I'm too afraid to even ask her to go because the thought of her saying no is heartbreaking. She knows I bought two tickets but she doesn't know I wanted to ask her to homecoming, she has me so far in the friend zone she even wants to help me ask a girl to homecoming. I know this isn't the place to ask but what do I do? Any suggestions would be great. Any motivational words to give me the balls to actually ask her would be kindly appreciated too."
Fuck not driving,"So 17, and still dont have my Class 7 license yet. (basically means i dont have my learners to get my full class 5 license) I've been reading the book for such a long time and every time I go into do the test I just blank, or i get to 29/30 and fail the test. its gotten to the point of hearing about the drivers test I get anxious about it. I really want to be able to drive and burn this fucking bus pass. And im in my senior year so it's like I am expected to have this license; or at least have the chance to get behind the wheel and learn. I feel like I can't even ask my parents to help me study for it because they will just guilt me about it, and it has happened in the past. "
I'm not sure what to do with my life anymore,"I'm stuck at work and feel like I cant handle my life. I'm a 22 year old biology grad that is unsure what to do with my life. I have been fighting with my parents due to indecisiveness of career. Things with my parents have deteriorated to the point were I actively avoid them or a fight is guaranteed to happen. About 4 days ago I decided to finally pursue law school and felt pretty good about it, in fact much better than I had in a long time, things seemed like they could be on the upswing. However, the next day my girlfriend if 5 years broke up with me, this was a girl that i defended from my family and friends, she wasn't just my SO but she was my best friend and one that I would have married in a heartbeat. Its hard, I feel lost and unsure and I find myself on the brink of losing it while trying to keep it all in. I cant talk to my family about it and my friends seem to preoccupied. Idk I just feel empty and lost. I miss her and don't know what to do other than throw myself at work to distract myself, this is my fourth 13 hour day in a row. What should I do?"
I think I have bedbugs and I don't know how the fuck to deal with it. Also family problems.,"So, as the title says, I think we might have bedbugs in our house, specifically the basement.

I'm sorry in advance if this seems scattered, and for all the swearing. I'm just in a very stressed out frame of mind.

This is the worst possible time to get those, as I was supposed to be taking all the stuff in the basement into my new apartment. Now I'm terrified that I'll get bedbugs not only in the basement, but also in the apartment and the other apartments too.

Oh God I don't know how to deal with this. This is a nightmare.

I've gotten bites all over my body and I can't tell whether bedbug bites or not. They're even on my fucking FACE. I've researched bedbugs, mites and fleas till I was practically an expert, but I still feel like I don't know anything. 

I bought this powder spray that goes in the crevices and baseboards and bed and whatnot, but I don't know whether I got everything. I sprayed it everywhere I think it may have been. I don't even see the fuckers, how the fuck am I supposed to know where they are? 

There is just so much work that I wasn't prepared for and I don't know how to deal with it. And the exterminator won't be open till Monday. I don't even fucking know if it IS bedbugs. 

And to top it all off, my bag of shit step brother decides that, since I'm the only other person in the house right now (as his mom and my other brother are out of town) that he gets to walk all over me and disregard anything I have to say (as usual) and  invite all his friends over at 2:30 in the morning and have their own little fucking concert upstairs, and then let everyone sleep over without me knowing SHIT about it. It was a real surprise to wake up and see some guy sleeping on the couch not 10 feet from my bedroom. YEAH YOU LITTLE FUCKWAD THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE OVER SO I DON'T FREAK OUT WHEN I SEE PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW PASSED OUT ON THE COUCH IN THEIR UNDERWEAR, YOU LITTLE CUNT. FUCK YOU.

I'm moving out in nine days (hopefully without bedbugs) and I cannot wait to not be around him. 

In all honestly, I just need someone to tell me that everything is going to be alright and that somehow I'll figure it out, and I won't get kicked out of my apartment.

**TL;DR: bedbugs suck balls and my step brother is a raging, infected asshole**"
My best friend from back in highschool is moving tomorrow to university in another city.,"It just feels really sad. Im gonna miss him alot. I dont deal with negative emotions very well and have trouble articulating them. Hes been around through my darkest days. When I got cheated on, when people I loved died, when I lost my job girlfriend and home in the same week. he was always there for me. He always let me sleepnover if i didnt have anywhere to spend the night and took care of me like his own brother. I just dont know how to feel now that hes leaving. I only have two other friends besides him and one of them is moving to california pretty soon. One by one im being left very alone and its just getting to me."
"I haven't seen my grandma in a year, and the first thing she says to me is that I'm getting fat...","Things haven't been super great for me lately, but they haven't been super terrible either. For the most part, I'm happy and I'm content with having to work slowly to reach my goals rather than becoming successful overnight. 

I've have body image issues since I was about 12 years old. I'm a fairly introverted person so I don't appreciate comments about my appearance no matter what they are.  I've just never been comfortable with my body and I'd rather people just say ""Hey, nice shirt"" rather than ""Aw, you're pretty/sexy/whatever"" if they're going to pay me a compliment related to my appearance. 

Anyway. Yesterday my boyfriend and I visited my mom for the holiday, and my grandparents and uncle are in town as well. I say hello to my grandma and she immediately says ""Looks like you're gaining a bunch of weight"", then my mom agrees with her. I'm kind of stunned, but not really that surprised. My mom has been known to stealthily call me fat and insult my body to my face without provocation. What was a slap in the face was my grandma adding on later that I will DIE if I get too fat. Wut. 

Now, I know that I'm heavier than I was last year. I attribute that to my eating real food instead of snacks and sodas all the time. I've also been avoiding the fitness center at my complex because of some creepers that live in my building constantly ogling me whenever I'm out. One of them even tried to feel me up one day, but that's another story. 

So I'm sitting here now, feeling gross and wondering what I could cut out of my diet and how often a week I should work out to shed about 25 pounds or so so everyone can get off my back about how I'm rapidly approaching obesity. I just filled my face with a bunch of rice and lentils and it's a struggle resisting the urge to throw it all back up again. 

I know it's stupid, and honestly should be the least of my worries right now...but I've already been beating myself up about the weight gain over the past few months. I don't need to hear it from my family every time I see them, too. :s 

TL;DR: I already know I'm fat, and I don't really need to be constantly reminded of it by my own fucking family. Bleh."
My family is suddenly ignoring me,"I don't live near any of them and I haven't changed anything I've done. It started by asking my brother where my dad lives now (he's been jumping around a lot lately) to send him a fathers day gift. No response past ""He doesn't live with me anymore.""



So I facebook my dad directly, as he lives on Facebook, because ruining the surprise was better than risking him getting mad over me not acknowledging him at all on father's day. No response, marked as ""seen.""


Fine. I guess. Dad gets moody.


So I tell my mom about this all (divorced) and she sympathized, and I said when she takes my young brother to go see him in a week, Id just send the package with them when they pass my town along the way. Ever since that, though, she's been ignoring my messages (insurance inquiries, asking for advice, etc) on facebook, even though I saw them marked as ""seen.""


I don't know what I did or what's going on... I know my family and I aren't very close and I know I don't call much (and when I do, they aren't that interested or just ask if I'm pregnant), but this is just out of the blue cold shoulder... I'm 22, socially inept-ish, but I hold my own and I don't mess up. Full time employed, have my own place, generally responsible. I just don't know what to do anymore, but this is really hurting me."
My friend seems to be fading out.,"I know this is how life works--- You have friends, some of them stay in your life and others fade out of it naturally. I was venting to someone about one of my faded friendships, and she brought up a good point. Now that you can have all these connections on social media, your faded friends are still kind of ...around. but they aren't and it's unnatural. It sorta goes against the natural order of things.

So here's my latest faded friendship I'm currently sad about-
I dated this guy for a year 7 years ago. we broke up and about 2 years later we became friends again. We would catch up every now and then on the phone, talk about people from high school and college and stuff. I texted him last month for his birthday and he didnt respond for a few days and texted again and he did. But he didn't hold a conversation with me. Yesterday I got curious about what he was up to, so I visited his Facebook page to find he had deleted me. 

He has a new girlfriend now, so maybe that's why. I dunno. He told me a few months ago this new girl was special and it seemed to me that he'd finally met someone that he had mutual feelings with. Maybe talking to me upsets her, or maybe he doesnt want to risk screwing this up with her? 

He was the last friend I had from high school. All the other ones have completely faded out for various reasons, I didn't have many to begin with. My oldest friend from childhood stopped talking to me after i went to college, giving me no explanation. This guy was the last holdout, and I guess it kind of stings that there doesn't seem to be any closure, just another fade away.

I texted him congrats on graduating last weekend, and sent him a brief fb message asking why we aren't fb friends anymore. Maybe he will respond, but I dunno. Maybe he doesn't owe me any explanation, but I wish he'd give me one. I feel like he's done a lot of things for me and I never got to return the favors. I hope I wasn't a selfish friend, and I wish I didn't always look for things to blame myself for. It's tricky to be friends with ex's, so maybe that's why it's done."
Uphill battles are getting so old.,"In December I was having martial issues and moved home with my parents. I have a five year old, my job transferred and promoted me and at the time it seemed like a good decision. 

My husband and I reconciled and he moved here and found a job right away. We've been working for 90 days and my father is being unreasonable to live with (we've had issues in the past, he's verbally and physically abusive and I thought he had sought help but apparently he's worse than ever) and I need to move out to keep my family safe. 

Well the apartment we lived in never sent us our certified letter and itemize bill so we haven't paid them anything. We went to get an apartment today and we're denied because of our rental history (this other apartment is the only place we've ever rented). I'm so furious and broke and cannot pay the outrageous amount they are asking and I have no help. I have nowhere to go. I need to get out. I'm so stressed out. Ugh."
I don't really know what's wrong with me.,"I have feelings of intense sadness and even feelings of contemplating suicide, even though I know I would never go through with it. I could never do that to my parents, they are the most kind hearted and loving people I know. Often I just feel no motivation to do anything. I know this probably doesn't make any sense, but I know that I'm attractive and people who know me tend to like me a lot, but I still feel like I have no confidence. However whenever I feel like I should tell my parents about this or book an appointment with a doctor, my feelings seem to instantly change and I feel like I don't need to, my mood begins to lift and I realize that things aren't that bad, but this is only temporary. I still feel like I should just man up and that my problems aren't so bad, as I'm typing this out I feel like this.

I think a reason for this is that my ex who completely broke my heart is going to the same university as me, I feel paranoid that everywhere  I go I may see her and she'll somehow judge me, but even when we were together I still had feelings of sadness.

One of my closest friends at University's Mother has passed away recently, and I know he relies on me quite a bit to get him through this, but sometimes I just feel completely drained and, as selfish as it sounds, I just don't want to deal with it. I'm just really not sure where my head's at and what I can do about it.   

I'm not great with grammar, sorry."
Nobody is interested in getting to know me!,"It doesnt matter what I do. Nobody wants to know anything about. 

Maybe I'm really ugly."
I want to see my infant son,"Hey reddit,  I have a son who is just over a year old.  I have only met him once when he was 3 months old,  his mother hates me,  has blocked all ways of communications,  sued me (and won) for child support, Not that I mind I'm more than happy to support my son.  She won't let me see him,  I live 7 hours away and all I want to do is see my baby boy I love him so much it breaks my heart,  I'm ignoring all grammar rules right now that's how much I don't care I just want my son I could cry. I took a loan for thousands of dollars and hired a lawyer,  I sued for basically joint custody or visitation,  pretty much whatever I could get,  she in turn counter sued me for full custody,  claiming I'm unfit to be a father,  that fucking heartless bitch how dare she.  Tears roll down my cheeks as I type this reddit. I just want my son. After she counter sued I haven't heard anything back from my lawyer,  it's been a couple weeks,  never been more heartbroken in my life. "
I hate that it seems like everyone does better without me.,"Especially with my last few exes, and friends who i've lost and even others..it always seems like when I drop out of their lives, everything goes better.

First ex-girlfriend: happily in a relationship and about to move out of our soulless town. Second ex : Now in an apparently ""much more steady"" relationship and getting ready to go to Grad school. Hell even the guy I ended up hurting because I dated my second ex has a hot girlfriend and has gotten his life back on track quickly.

It's just weird because everyone says ""oh well they weren't the one, the right one will come along""...yet everyone else's ""right one"" either comes along that much faster or maybe my ""right one"" just isn't coming. Just weird to hear all of my old friends talking about how life is so good for them all but yet..life just doesn't seem to get much better for me compared to everyone else. Maybe i'm just expecting too much, maybe i'm just too depressed to worry about it. But you would think after 3-4 years that things would get a lot better for you , and you would maybe have something to come back with when everyone else talks about how awesome their lives are.

Somedays I really just hope i'm expecting too much and that my time's coming..."

I ended up telling her how I felt, and she is actually not interested in a high school relationship, she just needs friends, she told me. I understand what she means, but she actually got really upset. Angry and depressed at the same time. She said that she felt like shit for having to reject me, and that I really was a cool guy.

And I guess it turns out that she hates A, at least, that's what she told me. Since then, she went on a vacation to Orlando for 10 days, and she just came back today, and it really is tough to move on. I guess, I just need advice on how to move on.

Is there anyone who could help with this? I want to be her friend, but I still feel overwhelming feelings towards her."
I just found out earlier today that one of my closest friends has been murdered.,"Part of me feels morbidly curious about the details of the stabbing. I want to know why, how. I want to know what his last moments were like... I think I'm angry that this happened, only right now I'm not sure of how I feel.

Right now, I feel guilty. I havent seen him in over a year. The last time I saw him, I was walking in the mall with my husband two floors down from where he was, and somehow, my friend saw us. He yelled for me. in my confusion, I almost just walked away. He yelled and yelled and told me to just wait there. He ran down two flights of escalators to me and tackle-hugged me. He was just heading home and so were we and we took the train together. I told him he looked good in his outfit, dress shirt, slacks and suspenders. I teased him about his murse.

It still doesnt feel real... "
I might have to have back surgery,"I have an appointment today to tell if I will have surgery or not. My doctor saw a bulging disc, a torn disc and a cyst on my spine. She said there could be more, but is sending me to a specialist to look at the MRI closer. I am scared because I have a 7 month old and I know the surgery can be risky, and what if I will never be able to chase her around or have other kids? I am trying not to think of it that way...but it's hard not to."
My dad may be made homeless in a month so he's sending my step mum back to America.,"**I apologise before hand about my writing, I don't feel like making it be all nice.**

My dad married my step mum about two years ago and brought her over from the states. She had a really well payed job as a police officer. All her family were over there too. The plan was to work at his gym for a while and then move back to the states.

But recently everything which could go wrong with his buisness has. He recently introduced cross fit to his gym but the people who designed it and installed it, did it wrong, and now the floor has broken. This means one of the rooms is useless and will cost a lot of money he doesn't have. He asked them to pay for it but they're refusing, so he was going to take them to talk. But his solicitor said that it might take as long as till next year to get them in court. Plus the solicitors fees are already at £2000.

And this week he also found out that one of his employees was messing with the files and has made him loose ~£10,000 ish. And his previous wife who had been doing the accounting, had not done it well, so he offers a company several more thousand pounds plus interest.

He approached his own father who has is capable of helping him, but he said he has to go and talk to my own granddad. My granddad also owns a business but can not help him at this moment in time. My dad did not want to do this because he does not owe him anything, and he is a proud man. So today he is going back to his own father to talk to him again.

If he does not get the money then the gym will close and he will have to sell his house. He does not want his wife to have a shit life or be homeless so in one final effort he is sending her back to the states where she can rebuild her life. He however from the sound of it will be made homeless.

All in all he needs about £40,000 which he doesn't have.

**TL;DR My dad's buisness is going bust and his own father who has the potential to help him is refusing. This means he may loose his house and business, so in one last effort he is going to send my step mum back to the states, so she can rebuild her life.**

Edit: I should probably mention that my parents are split up and I live with my mum. I only see my dad every two weeks and my parents hate each others guts."
I went so long denying that I was depressed - This is a synapse of my journey to realizing my own depression and my plan to recover -,"Hello. This is a rather long post about my journey through fighting fatigue and the realization of my own depression. These are the observations I had while going through it, and my current state of recovery. I hope whoever is reading this can gain some insight to their own problem and seek help themselves.

For years (I'd say about 6 or 7) I've had this nagging feeling, this exhaustion, a fatigue that would never leave no matter what I would try. I tried everything that was suggested to me: running, hobbies, delving into my work, yoga, meditation, sleeping pills, vitamins, breathing techniques, counseling, and many more, but I still felt this exhaustion. No one was giving me a solution to this nagging issue and I blamed myself. For so long I wondered what it could be.

""Why can't I be strong enough to fight through this? Why can't I do what others are doing when I am trying oh so hard? Why am I so lazy?"" I would ask myself these questions and criticize myself for all the issues in my life. I put pressure on myself and only made it worse and pulled myself away from realizing what was wrong. I'd put on a mask, always smiling and willing to lend a hand to distract myself from my mind. My grades were suffering, and I couldn't seem to pull myself out of this spiral.

This last weekend it seems that I finally crashed, I made an appointment with my doctor and spent the weekend doing no work and just pondering. I was ready to admit it: *I am depressed*. For some reason I was so scared of those 3 words. I went so long thinking that I could will myself through depression. I irrationally thought that it was a personal fault and that others would look at me different for being depressed, but this way of thinking hurt me for so many years, and those are years that I will never be able to get back.

My doctor gave me antidepressants to try out and I am on my second day of using them. I don't know if it's some sort of placebo effect, but I don't care. The difference between my attitude and energy levels now compared to just 3 days ago... it's like I was a different person. Today was the first day in a very long time being able to go through the whole day without feeling tired or in need of a nap. Although this is only the second day being on these antidepressants I feel so much more optimistic. I feel like I have the energy to be able to focus on myself and prevent that low feeling through personal care. 

The reason that I post this is to help all you out there that have the same symptoms as me and don't realize that it is depression. If you feel like you might be depressed, do yourself a favor: **admit it to yourself**. It is the first step to reaching out to getting some help. Whether it be support from family (or us on Reddit), counseling, or prescriptions, you owe it to yourself to be happy, and just about everyone is willing to help. Don't waste another second of your life with depression, please, for yourself, make a change for the better.

Thank you for reading."
"I have a crush on someone, and I'm sick of it. (Somewhat long.)","Last year, I had been mostly uninterested in girls. Then, I seemed to develop a crush on a friend of mine. She was in my choir, and she was delightful to be around. Her smile is usually infectious, and it is tough for me to be upset around her. However, that same year, her mother had developed some kind of cancer. I felt really bad, and I decided to really support her. I tried hard to cheer her up, but she became depressed on some days, and I don't blame her. I was only able to really talk to her after choir most days, because she was usually surrounded by friends. I'm too shy to actually talk to her in front of people, because I get worried, what if they find out? Enter a guy, let's call him A. He and her seem made for each other, and soon after, they actually start dating. This made me really upset, because a few weeks earlier, she said she wasn't interested in going out with me. I sulked for about a day, but then, I thought I grew out of it. The Choir went for a trip to a Milwaukee Brewer game to sing the National Anthem, and that day, it was official that they were together. I didn't react at all, I grew out of it, right?

Enter this year. At our first choir concert, one of her friends told me that the girl I liked and A have stopped dating. I was like, ""What?"" and I was actually surprised that they stopped. Earlier, I have been saying her after every first hour on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and every day after fifth hour. Hearing these news and seeing her every day rekindled my crush for her. I was barely able to see her, but when I did, I got really excited. I was happy when I saw her, and she usually stopped to say hi and exchange pleasantries.

This last semester, I found out she was in the same study hall with me, and also in the same gym class as me. However, in the same gym class is A. I started sitting closer to the girl I liked, she talked to me more and more. I noticed her being on a social networking site that I didn't have, so she told me to get signed up on there. On that same day, I got her phone number (although she thought I already had it.), and we carried on like that. In gym, I noticed that she and A were still spending a lot of time together, even though they weren't together. She missed a few days of school a few days, and when I asked her why, she told me she was feeling depressed. Of course, this makes me feels sad as well, so I told her that I would be there for her, if she needed someone to talk to. She told me, ""Thanks. :)"" and I started our normal humorous conversation that we usually have. She seemed to be doing better, and she was better the next day. However, aside from this instance, she usually doesn't respond to my texts. I ask her why sometimes, and she usually tells me that her phone died and she didn't feel like charging it. I know the feeling, so I decided to let that be. However, this happens again and again, and I don't honestly think that her phone always dies.

I usually ask my friends for advice about all this, and two of my friends told me that they asked A if he and the girl that I liked were still together, and A said no, they broke up mutually, and were to stay friends. I was excited about this.

A few days ago, I decided to ask her to hang out with me over spring break, which started today for me. She told me that she would ask her dad, and she told me that she probably wouldn't be able to, that she has a lot of plans already, and that her dad is probably planning a surprise for her. I was upset, but I carried on about it, and I kept on talking to her. Today, she told me that she's feeling depressed again, so right again, I was in a bad mood. She's really good at hiding her feelings. So, in gym today, I was talking with the girl I like, and then A decides to randomly come up and join the conversation. I got really anxious about this, and I decided to just walk away and talk to other friends. Throughout the whole hour, she just walked and talked to A while I walked alone listening to music. I've been trying to find a good thing about all this, but I was only able to come up with small things, like, ""Oh, she gave me her oreos today, doesn't that mean something?"" or, ""On a trip last year, she told me she lives close enough to me that she could probably bike over to my house, that sounds like something."" But other than the small things, I have nothing.

What do I do to salvage this situation? Would I be able to? Do I have any chance?"
I don't have strong emotions,"I really want to be an emotional person. I struggle to befriend new people because I do not connect with them on an emotional level. People think I am cool initially but they never find me all that memorable. I really want to change that but I don't know how...

I feel like it is telling stories about myself when they are related to whatever we are talking about. But also I am just trying to find my emotional motivation behind things that basically make up my life. I imagine it is important for when people ask what major I am or why I chose to join the Air Force. And I just have no idea what my emotions are behind them. I started writing down what I believe my emotional reasoning/motivation behind what I do and I showed it to my friend and he told me ""You're kidding yourself with some of the stuff you said"" so I guess I don't know what my emotions are behind them- if I even have any. 

So as you can see I am a very logical person. Everything I do in my mind is just because of logic. It just makes sense for me to be an engineer and it just makes sense for me to be in the AF but I mean...at some point it must've started from an emotion even though of course both of those things will lead me to success in character and money-wise. Maybe I just need to evaluate what my goals are in life first?

Just a side note: I am a 20 year old engineering student in AFROTC who was put on zoloft about 6 weeks ago due to depression and anxiety. Although I am starting to think that zoloft is not the answer. I feel like I have difficulty concentrating and finding motivation and such because I have low dopamine, not serotonin. 

Thanks for reading and hopefully helping me find myself and understanding myself. "
I'm not sure I want to stay in school,"I spent all day battling myself with this.  I know that I won't get to where I want to go without school, I know that nothing particularly good will come of my leaving school, but I can't bring myself to be excited about the next quarter.  

I turned 18 3 days ago, and I'm in my first year of college, which I started a year early.  I started college a year early because I left high school twice due to medical issues (mostly resolved now), and just basically said ""fuck it,"" and got my GED.  

My brother took a year off after his first year of university, got a job, and ended up hating it.  We're now going to the same community college.  I know this is exactly what will happen to me, but I just can't stand the thought of continuing to go to school.  I've been bored of it for as long as I can remember, and I don't enjoy myself at all.

I spent all day today crying on and off, and when I wasn't crying I was on the verge of tears and the slightest thing set me off.  I just don't know what to do, and I feel lost.  I know what I want to do eventually, but right now I don't feel like I'm accomplishing that."
My best friends forgot to include me in planning our tattoo.,"My roommates/best friends and I decided we wanted to get similar tattoos to represent the city we're studying abroad in. They both have multiple tattoos all over, I have none, so I was a bit hesitant at first and said I probably wouldn't, even though they managed to strike a deal with the artist for a cheaper price if we all went together. I reconsidered and said yes a week ago, I wanted to, and they were both ecstatic. One of them tells me casually on our way to class that they decided to make the appointment tonight to get it done in another week or so. I was a little taken aback as I expected more time to decide on a design and everything, as I wanted something a little more ornate than them. I asked why, and she said that because of the various trips they were both planning (some of which we're going together on) and other tattoos, they should just go ahead and schedule it. I expressed that I was upset that they went ahead and planned it without mentioning it to me or taking my preferences into consideration, since this was something we were supposed to do together. She responds that ""I guess we just forgot you weren't involved in that conversation"".

I've already felt a little left out of our trio, since my schedule is pretty different from theirs and they go to the gym together, so then for them to say they FORGOT to include me in plans to get a tattoo together really hurts."
Co-worker I'm interested in has a girlfriend,"Just got a new co-worker at my office about a week ago. Super attractive, great personality. We immediately hit it off, have tons in common and IM each other throughout the day to discuss things we enjoy. Today I overheard him mentioning his girlfriend in conversation with another co-worker. Boo. Oh well, hopefully we'll still develop a good friendship. "
I have to go to a meeting in about an hour and 1/2. 2 of my managers will be there and I'm at my wits end as it is...,"One of them decided to send me an email asking about an assignment I haven't finished with the other copied on it, making it look like I don't do shit (ironic I'm on reddit right now, I know)

I hate the asinine projects they give me that would have never been a problem in the first place had they given it half a thought when creating the product. I hate almost every aspect of my job with every fiber of my being and have been on the edge of quitting for months.

I can't afford to quit, but I'm afraid if one or both of them reprimands me, I may say something I will regret.(Even if it's true)"
I found out that someone I cared about doesn't like me the same way that I liked him,"Some background information on this person: we met in 2009, our 10th grade year. He liked me but I never felt the same way and told him so. We grew close and actually ended up going to the same college (it wasn't planned). Our first year in college he became really assertive which I liked and we started a sexual relationship with one another for the whole school year into the summer.

For our sophomore year, I couldn't live on campus but he did. As soon as he moved on campus, I heard less and leas from him. I thought he was just busy with moving in and whatnot so I didn't think much of it. Throughout that fall semester, he would ask me to drive him to Walmart and I would cause I thought ""hey, at least I get to spend a little time with him.""

I forgot to mention that for my birthday in September (of my sophomore year), he said that he loved me which further my interest in him thinking that everything was fine between us.

Come this school semester, his birthday was in January and I said I loved him and he said he loved me back. So I'm thinking cool, we still have that bond. 

Today, I send him a text saying that I miss him and he asks where is this coming from and after that I find out that he doesn't feel the same way that I do about him. So now, I feel real shitty and told him that I can't talk to him anymore. 

I don't blame him. I just wish he let me know when he didn't care for me on that level anymore. Mainly, I was too blind to see that the lack of attention was his way of showing me. Still sucks tho.

Tl;Dr - Fell in love with a best friend of 4 years buy just found out that he doesn't feel the same way."
My father killed himself 19 years ago and his family have completely shut me out.,"It's an incredibly confusing and knotted situation so I've bolded the ""off my chest"" rant, the paragraphs before the bold text are just background.


My father died in prison 19 years ago when I was five years old. and I feel like my aunts shame towards him has been pushed onto me and my sister.


From now on we will call her Susan.


Susan seems to have a control complex where if nothing goes her way, she pushes it out of not only her life but the rest of her families life too.


The best example that I can give of this is this: I last spoke to Susan when I was seven, but three years ago I found her on a genealogy website and contacted her again, hoping to learn more of this family that I had been shut out from.


Something happened, we didn't get along and she seemed in denial about her brother which made her tell me truths which ended up being false.


I met my other aunt a year later on the same website, we will call her Rachel... Me and Rachel got on extremely well but Susan was on speaking terms with her, what happened a few weeks after me and Rachel were getting to know each other is Susan found out and told Rachel that I went to Susan's house and caused trouble, to the extent where the police had to get involved and this made Rachel cut off contact with me.


It wasn't true, I'm nothing like my dad and I haven't seen Susan in roughly 15 years


A few years later (Last year, July) I e-mailed Rachel asking why she cut off contact and she explained everything but then explained that Susan had been lying to her about a number of things and that they weren't talking anymore so Rachel was prepared to give me a chance.


This was amazing, someone giving me a chance and not painting me with the same brush they paint my dad with! Fantastic! And These past six months with her have been fantastic, through Rachel I met my sister (My Dad wasn't on either of our birth certificates and I had no idea about her name or anything until a letter Rachel gave me helped me trace her). and I found out that I'm an uncle... I love both of them, my cousins and my two Nephew's to bits...


Though I digress, the main ""off my chest"" rant is this:


**Susan has contact with the rest of my cousins and another aunt, none of them speak to Rachel and Susan has been known to go to Rachel's house and cause trouble... I know all of my cousins names and even their Facebook profiles but even if I sent them a message I am 100% sure it would trickle down to Susan and Susan would give Rachel abuse for it... So I'm stuck, I have family who I can see but they're family that I can't let myself touch (For lack of a better phrasing)...**


**It's horrible, all my life this family has been shut off from me and because of this sociopath of an aunt I don't think I will ever get to meet them... It's so damn frustrating**"
My boyfriend can say some very rude things when he gets angry with me,"He doesn't seem very apologetic either, things are tough right now"
"Okay, I need help on ssomething that's bugging me","So my ex told me that she wants to get back together but at first I wasn't sure, but then when I asked her out like 2 days later she said she wasn't sure. That was last week and yesterday she just kissed me for no reason out of nowhere, but today she seemed like she didn't want to be with me."
I don't like where I'm living and I can't find cheap or free things to do here.,"I've honestly never been happy with Florida.  I was born and raised in Daytona and have lived in Miami for the past 2.5 years of college.  I feel like I'm letting the city itself keep me from really living my life to the fullest.  I have a good circle of friends, I'm a pretty social guy (but also an introvert), I like trying new things, but a lot of times I feel like my city doesn't offer many new things to try.  Certainly, everything I see that's interesting is really expensive.  I go to South Beach sometimes with friends, which is fun, but I can't always do the same thing.  I've tried Lincoln Road, everything is really expensive, I've become a regular member of my rock climbing gym (but most months don't have money to renew my membership), gone to the Everglades and hiked (there's a half-mile trail and it takes over an hour to get there from campus), and been to bookstores and record stores, most of which are tiny and cost way more than online shopping.  I'm not interested in the Ultra Festival.  When I asked a question about no-money-fun on the Miami subreddit using a throwaway, people laughed and said the best way to not spend money in Miami is to leave Miami.  I've had the same reaction from peers and adults I ask.

The thing is, it seems like the friends I've made since I've been here aren't interested in adventure, and aren't willing to try new things.  I know this is closed-minded of me to think, but I'm getting the sense that it's kind of like that in Miami in general.  Maybe I haven't been hanging out with the right people, but every time I recommend something new instead of routine to any friend group I'm with, I get a strong negative reaction, or called a hipster.

I used to think depression was causing me to hate whatever area I lived in, but I'm not a depressed person anymore and I still hate Miami.  I also love other places I've been to, like Asheville, in a way I didn't love Miami in the times I visited before attending school here.

So, I can't wait for graduate school which will hopefully be out of the area.  In the meantime though, what do you guys do to make the most of the areas you live in?"
"I'm tired of being a nice, responsible, honest, overall ""good"" person.","I feel like these traits make people take advantage of me. Everyday I see people who lean more on being bad (cheaters, liars, dicks, irresponsible people, etc) get away with it. Sometimes they even get more than what they deserve.

I'm tired of being ""nice"" but I can't help it. I feel guilty when I hurt other people, when I don't take care of my responsibilities. But it seems like I don't even get anything for it. Do you see what I mean? These dishonest pricks get away with being dishonest pricks, and I on the other hand, gain nothing. So what's the point of being good anymore? I should grow a mean spine.

Being nice/good makes me feel weak.  I hate it. I'm tired of it. But it's who I am. I don't like hurting people and I don't like being irresponsible.  

I don't like being taken advantage of, so maybe I should just be mean."
"The only sense of direction ive ever had in life haseither been from a toxic dependence on women, or drugs.","Taking myself out of addiction to stimulants, and ending my toxic relationships ive found myself very lost. i have no sense of where to go, who i want to be, or what i want to do. I tried making a list of goals, and they feel so forced. ""get fit"" ""save money"" ""practice music"". it feels so meaningless, and while i would like these things, they dont seem to invoke that drive in me. when i was in a very dependent relationship at different times in my life i had direction, the need to cling onto my SO consumed me, it gave me a role to fill, and it made me happy. the same went with drug abuse, that passionate need for something, that sense of direction, i knew what i needed. i was an addict, i knew who i was, and what to do.

everything else feels so mundane and uninteresting, anything i try to get into just doesnt really do it for me anymore. i dont feel like i fit."
It's over,I broke up with my GF tonight and now I can't sleep because to a certain extent I wish I hadn't
I don't like talking to people,"I love listening to people though; most of the time, when i talk to people, i end up just nodding my head and going ""mhmm"" and ""uhuh"", not because I'm not interested in the conversation (I'm usually pretty engrossed) but because it sometimes just doesn't trigger in my brain that, in order to listen more, i have to say something. it didn't really bother me until a close friend stated that it wasn't fun talking to me because it feels like he's talking to a wall. I don't really know what to do about it though."
My dog is unwell and I'm not sure when to call it a day,"Just before thanksgiving, we took our 13 year old greyhound mix to see the vet because we were concerned that she felt thinner than normal. The vet determined she hadn't lost any weight, but found a small lump developing on her side. We decided to just keep an eye on it, and if there was any change, we'd go back in for more tests.

Last week, we noticed she started limping on her front leg. Couldn't find anything wrong with her paw or leg - nothing stuck between the pads, and she didn't react to me touching or applying pressure. The limp disappeared after a few hours, but we noticed her back legs shaking a little while she stood. The shaking got worse and she started walking very stiffly on her back legs, so last Friday we headed back to see the vet.

Bloodwork was done and came back fine. No problems could be heard with the heart or lungs. X-rays were taken and showed the lump on her side and nothing more, but the vet wanted to get a second opinion.

By Saturday morning, our dog was able to stand but could barely walk with support. By the evening, when the vet called us back, she could no longer stand. The specialist who'd looked at the x-rays confirmed the growth on her side, but couldn't see anything on the internal organs. Due to her loss of leg control and unusually dilated pupils, they suspected there may be a second tumor on her brain or spinal cord. Further scans would be needed to confirm this. The scans would around $500, and would reveal if they could treat the known tumor. However, as the treatment would run north of $6000 - a sum we just can't afford, nor really justify for a dog her age - the scans would be purely academic. We opted just to try a course of steroids and try to make her as comfortable as possible.

I picked up the steroid pills on Monday morning. By this time, our dog had lost most of her bowel/bladder control so we're spending most of the time cleaning her up, washing towels and carrying her out to the back yard for her to attempt to do her business.

She's still eating well, and doesn't appear to be in pain. Although still early days on the steroids, she's showing a bit more energy, but physically no change. We're supposed to check in with the vet tomorrow. At this point, I have no idea what to do. Although devastated, I'd prefer to say goodbye sooner, rather than wait until she's in pain. But on the other hand, I feel I'm being selfish for seeking a quick way out."
Loneliness and lack of intimate relationships,"I want to meet a girl that would become my soulmate (I'm a guy). It's hard. Ridiculously hard. I am in my late teens and am living in a foreign country. Not particularly attractive, maybe average looking at best. The problem is that I just keep thinking about that all the time. Fuck. Even doing my hobbies, which I enjoy a lot,  feels like I'm trying to escape and compensate for not having an intimate relationship with a person of opposite sex. I lack companionship so much, even though I socialize a fair amount and have a lot of friends (albeit mostly male). It gets unbearable sometimes. Not even sure what my problem is to be honest. Stumbling upon all those ""I met a girl..."" and such stories makes me feel like shit because it seems like it will never ever happen to me. I thought that urge would go away, but it has only grown larger, and it's been eating me from the inside.

I got high with a celebrity's nephew.,"because it's easy to obtain the identity of this person, i wont give out anymore information on his identity. 
so, what bothered me was that i believe this person has a real drug problem, and even so much as feel genuinely sorry for this guy. 
while a friend and i were smoking weed, this person left the room for about an hour, and came back a completely different person from the nice guy i thought he was. he was itchy, twitchy, talking fast and about nonsense and moving all over the place.
it hit me: this dude wasn't high on weed. he was on something far worse...
when i later asked my friend in privet what his deal was, all he said was: ""we think he has a drug problem. but we don't talk about it.""
i guess it just bothers me so much because i sense how unhappy this person was (even though being related to a celebrity and able to grow up so privileged)."
Wrong place at the wrong time or how I can't be with the person I've always wanted to be with,"A good 6-7 years ago I met and fell in love with a Canadian girl. To this day she is the only person I've ever loved. Due to moving across the Atlantic to study in England, we never got in a relationship because the separation would have been too brutal. However,  in that time we spent almost every day together.

Since then we have both gone through uni, gotten stable jobs on our different continents. We have both had relationships but nothing ever stuck. I've come close to loving others, but it never was the case. In my case I still thought of her on occasion and wondered if she remembered me the same way I remember her. I always got to a stage where I thought I had finally left her behind only to be pulled right back in as soon as we talked for any length of time. Those feelings would come rushing back and once again she made me completely vulnerable and truly happy. 

In the last few years I've come back to Canada twice to visit her and my friends and both times we instantly hit it off again, as if we never left each other. Both times we have expressed how much we want to be together. This last time circumstances sadly only allowed us to see each other for a couple of hours but in those couple of hours I felt whole again. I am thinking of someone for hours on end for the first time in years. After all these years, I just want to be with her. 

Unfortunately it cannot happen.  We both have amazing jobs and we're both dedicated to them. No matter how much I want to be with her, my well being comes first. 

And that, reddit, is what's bothering me; I just want to be with the only person who's made me feel alive, but circumstances never work in my favor. Maybe one day. 

Thanks for letting me rant :)"
"These 2 months: Broke up with my LTR, got an opportunity to study abroad, started dating my long time crush. Sounds perfect right?","To put this into context: I'm a creature of habit. My friends are restless and adventurous, but I'm happiest when life is going smoothly. So when you're reading this keep in mind that these drastic changes are more traumatic to me than they seem or should be. My life looks nothing like it did 3 months ago.

I was in my first ever relationship for 4 years with H. Things had been getting gradually worse for a year or two, and I really tried to fix it but finally decided to end it. We had become different people. Things had been going bad for ages so I don't have any lingering feelings for him.

A week after the breakup I got offered the opportunity to study overseas. I've never been away from my home town. I'm afraid of being terribly homesick. Part of me feels like this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it would be stupid to give it up... the other part of me thinks I won't regret it much. I've never wanted to live or work overseas, I already have a good job in my home town I'm happy with. I'm pretty sure that I can fix things with work so that I'd keep my position when I get back though, so that's no excuse. I've been putting off deciding if I want to go or not because I felt like I'd made enough life-altering decisions for that month.

Last week (2 months after my breakup), after much flirting and anticipation I finally started dating a good friend and long term crush of mine, D. This guy has given me butterflies for the past year, and he means a lot to me. I know a week isn't much but it feels like more, because we were friends long before. We're so similar.

Life should be perfect, right?

I need to decide whether I want to apply for the thing abroad by end of November. I haven't told D about it yet. Everything's so great on that end, and I would hate to ruin it. Assuming we're still together I'd have to leave in 6 months time and be long distance for 3 months. And I'm not sure if I want to go in the first place. Homesickness.

And about D... I've been happy, I've had some butterflies, but sometimes when he looks at me with that massive smile I freak out inside. I know he's as crazy about me as I am about him. I don't have any feelings for H but I think that this past year has really made me jaded and mistrustful of other people and most of all of myself. What if I mess this up? D is really cutesy and romantic and I know that if I was okay I'd just love every minute of it, and I do, but sometimes it scares me.

I feel stuff with D is so new, I don't want to put it through all this stress. I know that if I tell him I would feel better, but it would make him feel worse. This should be my perfect happy moment but instead I'm crying as I write this. I thought I was holding it together better than I actually am. I wish I knew what to do."
Anxiety and drinking,"Every time I go out with my friends I feel like I have to drink to get rid of my anxiety. This results in me getting really drunk before I really even notice it, and I start acting like a complete jackass. I try talking to new people thinking I have this new found confidence but I end up just embarrassing myself. I always wake up the next day with anxiety that is worse my hangover and swear that I'm never drinking again. This weekend was the lowest I think I've seen my self, I was  getting really belligerent and rude to everyone I talked to and feel like I made a really bad impression on some new friends. I think I need to take this as a hint to stop drinking all together, and to stop putting myself in these situations where I can make my anxiety worse."
"From dating to being friends, I feel conflicted about her new relationship.","Hey guys. I don't know how to format on Reddit well, so I apologize.  
   
   I'll call this girl Aria.
  
  I met this girl at the beginning of the year. We just started College. Wt met on the last day of the first week in class where we sat next to each other because there weren't many seats left. After getting to know Aria in class, I asked for her number with the idea that if we were going to be classmates for the next two years, I might as well be able to contact her.  
  
 As the weeks go on we got close. Relatively close, in-between breaks we would share information about ourselves, from basic information to even things we wouldn't normally share. I began to have feelings for her. As a pair, we would always be mistaken as dating because we were so physically close; cuddling on couches, walking to class, always spending time together on campus when we were there, I would even walk Aria to her car after classes to keep her company and she would drive me to a friends house each day after classes (The house is about five minutes driving from campus).
  
 As time went on my feelings got stronger.   
  One day, I told myself ""I want to ask this girl to date me."" We attend class as always and I walked her to her car. I had asked her ""What would you think of us dating?"" and Aria replied with ""I don't know. I never thought of it."" Needless to say, I felt rather hurt because of how close we were. Our relationship seemed to be more than friends and yet she never put a thought into it. I went home that day emotionally crushed. After I got home, Aria had sent me a text asking me to go to a show with her that was on campus. Thinking it would be weird of me to ignore her or simply say no since we were still friends, I said I would go with her.   
  
 After I went to the show with her and her friends I came across one of my friends who was at the show. This was a friend that would tell me ""Hey, you and her would be a really cute couple together"". When I saw him I moved away from sitting next to her and went to talk to him. I began to tell him about how Aria said she never thought of us dating and that I was feeling pretty down about it. He bought me a beer and we talked through the show about how it was an unfortunate situation. He decides to buy me a beer; she notices this and takes my keys saying ""You're not getting this back until you sober up!"". It was a kind gesture. I thought she was just being a good friend and ignored it. As we're talking and I'm not paying attention to the girl, he tells me that she was looking over at me a lot. When the show was over he asked Aria to take care of me saying he didn't want to be accountable for an accident if I got into one.
  
  At this point the show was over. Everyone left, both her friends and mine. It's been hours since I drank that single beer talking to my friend. I ask for my keys back after thanking Aria for inviting me and saying I'd be going home. She doesn't budge; doesn't want to give me my keys.   
  
  We walk to her car and we have small-talk about how she had fun and was glad I came. I just wanted to leave though. This was a girl who had just told me that after all of our interactions she would never have thought of dating me. It hurt, really.  
  
  When we're at her car, we stand outside her door for a while like we normally would after our classes. She hugs me and asks if I'm okay to drive. She gets really sad suddenly instead of having her bubbly, upbeat attitude. I figured this was because she didn't want a friend dying in a car accident (I've been hit by a car before as a pedestrian so it worried her). She drives me to my car across campus and stops me from driving. We talked for a long time about how I would be okay since it had been a while. More talking through the night and she says ""Don't push your luck! I need you alive."" I already thought my chances at dating her were non-existent. I said ""Screw it. I'll push my luck. Hey Aria, will you go out with me?""  
   
  She said yes to dating me. I was ecstatic, I felt lucky. A week later, we break up. Aria told me she wasn't able to be in a relationship because of her problems and that she didn't want a boyfriend. That feeling of being crushed resurfaced. It left me empty. We were still friends after this.   
  
  One month passed. During one of our lectures she had looked upset. Curious, I asked Aria the for the reason. Aria said ""I have a date later tonight. I'm nervous."" I felt like time had stopped. It was shocking to hear that. Having been told that she didn't want to date for personal reasons and that she didn't want to date, she had agreed to date this new person. She had told me that if I was upset with her choice she wouldn't date him and instead wouldn't have a boyfriend. I'd feel guilty being the reason that she can't be in a happy relationship, yet at the same time I don't want to lose her I suppose.  
  
  I feel empty. I don't resent this girl but I'm not happy with her choice either. I'm unsure of what to do. To be honest, I don't even want to be around.  
  
  TL;DR: I met a girl and dated her in college. Dumped me because she didn't want to be in a relationship or have a boyfriend. One month later she dates a new guy. "
[Quick list] ish,"- My grandpa passed away on Tuesday night, I feel like I didn't spend enough time with him near the end
- Although I'm technically accomplished in my career, especially for my age I still feel like I've hit a wall that I can't move past (I'm a graphic designer.)
- My love life has come to a screetching halt. I manage to bad a one nighter once every month or so but my life is completely devoid of any meaningful intimate relationship and has been for over 10 months now
- I cant seem to get my finances on track so that I can save a decent amount, no matter how hard I try
- The friend I'm supposed to be moving in with is so bad with money that we've had to postpone the move date by 3 months now
- I'm trying to start up my own studio with a friend, we both work for a studio currently and have the skills to go it alone except for the fact we're both completely disorganised. "
I'm feeling a repeat of what happened to me as a freshman.,"When I was in college my first semester ever, I failed nearly every class.  It wasn't just that I didn't go, but I didn't put in any effort.  Of course, part of that was my raging ADD which at the time I wasn't medicated for, part of it was that I never had to try in high school and managed to get into the school I wanted to go to, and part of it was that I was depressed and didn't even really care enough to register with the disability resource center, or really even attend class most of the time.  My grades game out, I was almost dropped from the university, and my parents threatened to stop paying if I didn't get my shit together.  At the time, I was in a serious relationship with someone, and not wanting to lost that, I spurred myself into gear, got onto methylphenidate (which helped me tremendously) and started caring more about school.  Three semesters of all A's plus retakes of those classes I failed on has resulted in my current 3.25 GPA.

This semester, things are slightly different.  I'm no longer in that relationship, I'm more confident and not really depressed, I'm looking to transfer to a better school, and I've switched from sociology to pre-med.  I'm not medicated anymore - I missed a couple of appointments over the summer - and I'm feeling the heat from my lack of ability to sit and concentrate on studying, no matter how hard I try.  On the other hand, I've been more creative than I've ever been before, I write raps and have been putting out about five every single day, of a quality that I didn't think I'd ever be able to write.  I know that if I get back on the medication, that won't be happening, the medication sort of stymies my creative, big-picture side while reinforcing my logical, practical side.  So, I feel like part of me doesn't even *want* to be medicated anymore.  I know it's dumb, I've come this far and I have a good GPA, I only have a couple of years left and I **just started** rapping, but I feel like it's what I really want to do.  Practically, I know it will probably never happen, no matter my skill level.

That being said, I'm not even sure I'd be able to get back on the medication if I wanted to.  I live four hours away from my psychiatrist and our HMO doesn't cover anyone where I go to school.  I have classes 6 days a week, and the one on Saturday I can't miss even once without getting an automatic F.  I'm really hating not being able to go home every now and then, especially when it's for something that's really important, like this.

Meanwhile, I just took my first round of tests for the semester, and got an F in Spanish II, an F in College Algebra, a D in Biology, and an A in Urban Geography.  There's still time to make it all up and do better, but I don't know what to do.  I know this is all muddled and jumps around a lot, but I'm more looking to vent and wondering about general advice in my situation."
Long term girlfriend and I are having serious problems at the same time someone I'm interested in has become available,"I am very confused right now and I just feel like I need to get it all out. I made a post a few days ago that my girlfriend was unsure if we should be together anymore, now another big complication has arisen.

My girlfriend and I have been together for several years, and through that time we have seen our ups and downs. We live together and have been building a life together and we have very similar interests and we both care about each other. We get along fine most of the time, but that ""spark"" has diminished a great deal. She doesnt feel like I am passionate about her and I dont fulfill her romantic needs, while I dont feel satisfied sexually and havent for some time. We have talked about marriage several times, but always in a ""someday"" context. 

A few months ago, I became very close with a female coworker of mine at another job. Over the course of a few months we became very good friends and texted each other constantly, mostly about mundane things but overall we had a great time together and enjoyed each other's company. Nothing explicitly inappropriate happened, but it made my girlfriend uncomfortable that we got so close. There was definitely some mutual attraction between the two of us, but she was in a long term relationship as well and there was never any chance of anything happening. I feel guilty even typing this, that there were times when I wished things had turned out differently - if we had met under different circumstances maybe we could have given it a shot. But I never pursued it, and I never made any steps to cheat, at least not in a physical way.

I came to realize after a certain point that part of why I connected with her so much was I liked how she made me feel - she thought I was smart and funny and made me feel confident in ways that I hadnt felt with my girlfriend in months, maybe even years. I had this emotional relationship with her that I was using to supplement how lacking my own one felt was at home. I realized this after a blowout with my girlfriend, and decided to try and cut ties and salvage my relationship. That happened about a month and a half ago.

Recently, my girlfriend went to a wedding and seeing the other couples there made her start to seriously question if we were right together. She is afraid that we are together now out of comfort and habit more than anything. We got together in college and we have both changed so much since then, she feels like maybe we just grew apart. She is worried that we are going to end up being just good friends who live together, rather than two people in love. I still love her and care about her deeply, but I have had the same fears at times. Sometimes I feel like she just isnt happy with the person I am naturally and wants me to change to fit her needs. I've been trying to reassure her and show her that we can make it work, that the things we have gone through are natural and happen in all relationships and that we can fix things if we work really hard. But honestly, I dont know if thats true because I haven't dated that many people and I dont have enough context to be sure.

I just found out that the other girl, who I felt so connected to, recently broke up with her long term boyfriend as well. I feel like this just adds another huge layer of complication to what I was already going through. If I broke up with my girlfriend now it would be a huge, painful, complicated mess, but I would be free to pursue this other person who I feel strong chemistry and attraction towards. Sometimes I feel like my current girlfriend likes me for who I was and who she thinks I have the potential to be, whereas this girl likes the person who I am now. But maybe thats just because things are fresh and new and I had used them as an escape from my problems.

I'm not planning on breaking it off with my girlfriend anytime soon because we have invested so much time and effort into being together, but I cant help but wonder if we are just forcing it when we could be happier with other people."
Secretly fallen for a guy who isn't available.,"I've ended a long term relationship 2 weeks ago because of many reasons, after a year of problems. These past few months I've also fallen pretty badly for a guy friend who is currently in a relationship (for a year or so). It happened gradually, without me really noticing, and now I'm here and it doesn't come with an off switch. The way he acts sometimes makes me think he has feelings for me too, but that just might be me projecting. 

This is the first time I've been single since I've known him. I don't know if he knows I'm single yet. I'm bracing myself for the moment when he finds out or it comes up and I'll have to tell him. I understand how complex and fragile relationships are and it's not like I expect him to drop everything now that I'm single (assuming he even thinks of me that way), but I can't help but wonder... hope... dream...

I would never actually say anything to him at this point, I know my place and am happy to stick to men who are actually available, but I can't help but be a little sad. I'm bracing myself for the disappointment which inevitably is to come. I'd like a metaphorical shoulder to cry on."
I can't enjoy reading anymore.,"I used to be really into reading. Mostly books, but also comics and video games that involved a lot of talking/text to read, such as RPGs. But ever since I've been in college, reading has turned into this giant chore. All the reading required for classes, with such boring writing, it just makes me so sick of seeing letters. 

When I'm even in a mood to read, and I open up a book, I think to myself ""shouldn't you be reading your school books?"" So I feel too guilty to continue. And if I have the freedom to read for leisure, it just feels like work. I want to slam the book shut after a chapter, even when I have nothing else to do.

And with video games, it's worse. I can't stand conversations in games now, so I've limited myself to playing shooters or games that don't require reading. Games where you can just get into action and not worry about the story. 

I'm worried that I won't ever enjoy it again. Like college has irreparably damaged part of me that liked to read."
One simple thing a girl I was talking to said to me caused a big hit to my psyche,"About a month ago a girl I've kind of known for awhile from work started blatantly hitting on me on night and was very forward with how much she liked me. She's really cute and I thought I'd be interested in getting to know her better too so that night I mustered up the courage to get her number and for a week or so we texted back and forth a good amount and I was getting ready to ask her out to a Cleveland Indians baseball game over the weekend.

At work word quickly spread that I asked for her number and that we started talking and immediately one day I felt bombarded by a group of coworkers and a couple managers, and they were either saying a some things about her, asking what we've done and what we're going to do and just wouldn't stop getting involved in my business and that kind of scared me a little bit but I tried playing it cool. 

The next day or both the girl and I were working the same shift and lets just say I had a ton of anxiety built up regarding when the appropriate time was to ask her out, how I was going to do it, and what kind of stuff to talk with her beforehand and I was so trapped in my own head and thoughts that I shut down and barely uttered a word to her that entire night until she came up and asked ""Where've you been all night?""

 I have a hard time opening up and expressing my emotions a lot of the time when I went to her and told her about how I was feeling after basically feeling *interrogated* by everyone else and explained to her how that was the reason why I hadn't said much, she responded with a simple ""you need take a chill pill, dude."" That was basically when we stopped talking and things have been pretty awkward between us since. That lone comment made my general anxiety even worse and it completely changed the way I interact with people. I've been much more quiet and reserved at work since, keeping to myself for the most part and haven't been my previous outgoing self since and I think most people have noticed that. I'm in a pretty weird funk right now."
"Cheated on my girlfriend, can't take what I deserve.","My girlfriend found out that, in a moment of drunken weakness, I kissed another girl who I'd been texting for a while out of boredom. It was over in less than five seconds, I hated myself as soon as it happened, and I cut off all ties with the girl immediately after. I can't deal with the thought of losing her over this, or explaining to my son why he'll never see her again. Not looking for sympathy because I know I don't deserve any. I just don't understand why she doesn't see that I still love her, and always have, even though I made this stupid, shitty mistake. Is there any way for me to prove to the love of my life that I can change? Or should I just accept my punishment?

EDIT: My little boy isn't...her little boy. They're just really close, as young as he is."
My friend isn't being my friend,"We've been friends for five years, five years of daily contact with nothing but happiness and good conversation. Then, communication stopped. (we moved away from our home town). I received a letter with nothing but positive things about our friendship and a section of encouragement ""for rainy days."" I know she cares about me, we've been through hell and high water together. We know everything about each other; yet she wont respond. We've accidentally met while visiting home, and its been jovial and pleasant. We sat and talked for 2 hours on two separate occasions. But she wont respond to emails, phone calls, or texts. One response I did happen to receive was that she wasn't purposely ignoring me, but the circumstances seem to say otherwise. I feel that ive lost my closest friend for no reason."
"I've been hopelessly infatuated with a girl for 3 years. I know what I need to do, but I don't know how.","I know I need to tell her how I feel,  no hope for anything if I don't, but how? And what then? If she says no should I distance myself from her? I have spent every hour for 3 years thinking about this girl. I asked her out 2 years ago and she rejected me then, I doubt things have changed, but I'll never find out unless I ask. We're very good friends and I value our friendship very much. 

I don't know any way to express my feelings to her though. I'm better at text communication, but that seems insincere.

Sorry for this not being very well constructed, I'm trying to figure it out myself. 

"
"I don't like to say the word ""love"".","For years. Why? peoples families: they have many conditions, for example, if they ""love their child"" some families will hurt their children (violently, sometimes) if they did something they disliked. Relationships; Some people will reject your caring and compassion if you don't have sex with them, sex is called ""making love"" (if love is caring why does there need to be sex?), some people can say ""I love you"" and then end up doing the worst things to you (such as destroying a PS3 if someone isn't paying attention to them but rather video games, or killing you for who-knows-what, beating you, etc.) or even cheat on you. Or just eventually stop liking you.

I like someone a whole lot right now but just can't say ""I love them"" although I pretty much have the feelings as what the word ""love"" is described. A friend told me that if someone loves you and you can't say that back, they will eventually stop. 

Although I truly really like this person."
The thought of being in a relationship opens the floodgates of negative emotions.,"I've dating and had a few relationships before, but I've been single for about 10 months I guess.  
Since the last relationship I've tried dating, but it hasn't worked out.

But I've developed, sort of by accident, an almost-dating relationship with someone.  
We spend a lot of time together (2-3 days a week), we go out to eat every other week, we're close intellectually and at times physically - but the concept of us ""dating"" or being in a ""relationship"" does come up directly.

But when I think about us being together, and all that would come with that, I feel just horrible in ways that are hard for me to put into words.  
"
"I am a failure at jobhunting, and probably at life","Hello guys, I need to get this off my head asap. This has been bothering me for a year+. I am currently 23, soon to be 24. Last year I have graduated with a first class degree in maths from one of the top universities of the uk. I have ""great"" GCSEs and A levels with awards to match. So you might be surprised then, as to why I have no job, and here sighing.

Last year when I graduated, my dad, who owns a takeaway needed a trustworthy person to handle the counter, organisation of the service, the documents, finance and all that compliance stuff. It turns out I was the one to do it. At first, I was like ""huh? but I don't want to do this, I want to find a real job, a job where I don't work for a member of family"". Well I did it anyway, but as I did, I was wondering what job I actually want to do. 

You see, during university, I tried to apply for those big investment banks that everyone was talking about as well as the normal banks along the way and it didn't work out. I don't know what is wrong with me, but I absolutely hate interviews, whether by phone, or in person. Often the interviewers ask these questions on leadership, stuff that gets out of control and how I approached this and that. To be honest, fair enough if they have to ask it, but it doesn't mask the fact that I feel like pulling my fingernails off everytime they ask me a question. I just dislike talking for some reason. I just remember every failure I did during the interviews, from what I said that I felt could have been better, to the rejection emails. I still remember my epic fail from 2010. Am I just not capable to move on?

So fast forward to today, and I have given up the idea of working for the big guns, because I'm doubting whether i'm actually suitable for the job. But I need to get a job, and many of my friends recommended me to go onto accountancy. The thing is, their procedure of hire (especially for the ""big 4"") is just as, if not more... talkative. There is a phone interview, first interview, final interview and group excercise. ""Oh dear god, give me strength"" is the thought that went through my mind when I read through that. I find it difficult to muster the courage to click ""send application"". I mean, i'm actually quite happy to do those online verbal and numerical tests and stuff which could take 40mins+, but a 15 min interview? No way! Hence, I procastinate big time when it comes to those applications.

I don't know what to do anymore. To add on top of this, I see myself as a failure in society, because I don't have a strong ambition. I'm halfway between going all in on accountancy and i.t. . When I am alone, I just think of how awful I am. I envy my friends. Some are doing what they always want to do. The others? Well, they may not be doing their ideal jobs, but at least they got a job. I envy my brothers. My older brother is rather successful with his career as a banker. I had recently got rejected from one of the big4 with no real explanation, whereas my younger brother (who graduated this year) managed to go pass where I failed.

To take my mind off those feelings, I pass the time by doing what I dreamed of doing when I was a kid - to make computer games. With minimal programming experience, I learnt some Java and some android, and with those armed with google and 2 months, I published a game. It isn't going to compare with ""Cut the Rope"", (in fact there is plenty to improve) but it was the only time since graduation when I felt a little bit happier. I think I will move on to Unity and C# to make a better game.

This feeling does little when every now and again I look out the window, and I see my mother doing some gardening. One time, when I saw her, and her grey hairs floating in the wind, I just broke down alone in my room. I couldn't take it anymore. I am a terrible son, unable to provide any financial resources for her. I told her, that when I earn money, the first thing I would do, is to save up and let her go on holiday. She hasn't been on one since I was born. Instead, I am a leech on her house, her food and her electricity bill.

I wish school took stuff like interviews more seriously. I wish I was taught programming when I was a child so I can pursue a career there. I wish I wasn't so pathetic as I am so I can pursue a career in accounting. I wish for anything that would totally tell me ""I can do this"". My ""success"" in education only adds to the pressure that I am not succeeding. I am failing in life, and I don't know how to fix it."
I lied to a girl I am crazy about and it caught up to me,"So I began talking to this girl a few weeks ago and we hit it off like crazy. I had just gotten done with some sort of relationship that wasn't official right as we began hanging out. The girl I'm with now saw me texting the old girl and I told her it was just a friend. I only lied so I wouldn't scare her off because I knew from the moment we started talking that I would develop amazing feelings for her. Well she mentioned it last night and I told her straight up that I was just getting over the old girl but we were not together while I was texting her(which was mostly true). The girl that I like now flipped out and pretty much won't even talk to me. I am so bummed out that I want to puke and I have no idea how to make it right. She won't ever trust me again and I don't know if she'll ever like me as much as before. I am so upset and feel like I'm lost without her. I have no idea how to make it better and it is all my fault. She doesn't even believe me when I tell her how much she means to me. I am sick about it and I really don't know what to do/how to cope.

I know it isn't the usual heavy stuff that most people share here, but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Thank you for listening."
I was in a relationship with and I did not realize what I had until I lost it.,"8-10 months ago, I made someone quite lovely, gorgeous even, fall head over heels for me while they were still in a relationship with someone else. They were in a relationship with someone extremely jealous and controlling. They needed someone to listen to their problems, they needed someone that understood. I made sure to completely make them feel special, I made them feel like their problems were being heard and understood. I even sent them sweet poems and letters. I made sure to completely woo them over. I made them feel like they were on top of the world. Eventually, they did break up with their SO just to be with me-the understanding one, the one that listens, the one that they thought was the good guy. 

And to my surprise they were the type of person most people would kill for to have a relationship with. They were the sweetest of the sweetest. They would always be there for me whenever I asked. They made other people jealous of me. They bought me expensive things, they took me anywhere I wanted, they even took me to a concert that was pretty costly.

It doesn't sound like much of a problem to be in a 5-star relationship with someone as excellent as the person that I was dating. Except, I am not a person to get attached to someone, nor a person that opens up easily. I am a person that has flings and short relationships that last for about a month, not committed relationships. I am afraid to fall in love. I am manipulative, a sweet talker, you would call me a 'player'.

After a couple of weeks, I abused the privilege of being in a relationship with someone who would do anything for me. It started out with me refusing to kiss them or hold their hand, I imagine it felt like being a bit rejected. I made them jealous and I liked the fact that they were afraid to lose me to someone else. I stopped calling, or answering any of their calls. I stopped texting. I ignored them on purpose. I made excuses to why I didn't want to see them. I lied to them about quite a lot. I don't know what was my goal, I don't know if I wanted them to feel bad about themselves or if I grew bored of them.

Eventually, I broke up with them. It broke their heart completely. Although they refused to give up on me. They were still there somehow. They were constantly looking for ways in, trying to figure me out for about a month more. I didn't realize that they were the only person in my life that actually cared for me. And my biggest mistake was that I told them to move on, that I never wanted a partner and I've never loved them, that they are free to leave. They stopped trying, and they stopped talking to me.

2-3 months later, they popped up in my mind and stayed there. They refused to leave my thoughts. And the strange part, whenever I saw someone that looked like them, it completely hurt me on the inside. I wanted them again. It was a weird feeling but, I NEEDED to talk to them. 

Prepping and preparing what I'd say to them, I went on their twitter to what seemed like forever (I deleted their number a long time ago) and found out they're back together with their last SO. Strangely, I don't want to ruin what they have with their last SO. They seem happy together. I've been ignoring my feelings until now but it's gotten to the point where I want nothing but my ex. 

I feel awful for the things I did, and I want to start over with them. I don't think talking to them is a good idea, and I don't know what to do. I don't think I'm in love. I don't know why I'm feeling like this. It may be because I want someone to care for me again? I'm lost.

Edit: I was in a relationship with SOMEONE. I can't really change the title."
Can't be happy without my girlfriend,"My girlfriend is Muslim, and has very strict parents who don't let her out much. Were both 16, we've been dating for 9 months now. I care about her very much, so much to where I can't bring myself to be happy or do anything other than mope when I'm not with her. I don't see her very often so this happens a lot. I need to find a way to be able to be productive/ happy even when I'm not with her."
I can't stop thinking about a girl... unfortunately she's married,"I met her about a month ago at work (I work in a building of about 500 people), and we hit it off from the start. She was engaged at the time, so I didn't want to make a move. The next weekend we went out drinking and she started making out with me. The hanging out/making out continued for a few days, then she got married. We haven't hung out since her marriage a few weeks ago but I can't stop thinking about her. I see her almost every day at work which makes it even worse. I have morals so I really don't want to get involved with a married girl, but this is really bothering me."
Success = Happiness?,"I'm a simple man of simple means; I didn't graduate High School (Did get a G.E.D), I have an above minimum wage job, I rent my own place, I have the ability to buy things that I want, I've time enough for hobbies, and to top it all off I'm in great shape. 

I live a life that I should be both happy and content with, and yet I can't help but feel like a failure. I've no idea what I want to do with my life and I don't have a degree of any sort. Usually these things don't bother me but lately its seems that my Family, Friends, and potential girlfriends are all of the mind that I'm going nowhere fast. Apparently, one must have a degree to be happy and successful, and if anyone says otherwise they're fooling themselves.

I don't know what to do, I really don't want to go to college; I've never been the book smart type and I just don't see the wisdom in me paying to get tortured and then ending up in debt. But it's really affecting my social life, I've had more than a couple of people (friends and girlfriends) cutoff ties with me because they felt I wasn't ambitious enough. I just want to be happy, I want a modest house, a girl who understands me, and the ability to walk around with my held high, but apparently I need a degree for that.

Every time we talk or hang out, she apologizes for breaking up with me, or I ask what I did wrong to prompt it. I've been trying recently to avoid this but...it just hurts. I don't want to just stop communicating with her though, you know?"
A video I think everyone should watch.,"Hey guys. I originally came here to post about lady troubles I've been having to get my feelings out, and I might still do that, but after reading through some posts I thought I would share a little something I do to cheer myself up in times of sadness.

For a period of well over a month after these lady troubles started I would start off every day watching this video while I drank my morning coffee, and it has made me a far cheerier person. Even now I watch it when Im down. Even after so many viewings it manages to lighten the burden a little.

I hope this helps. Pay special attention to the latter half where he talks about silly ways to cheer yourself up. They help more than you think."
I'm having trouble listening to music with earphones.,"Any helpful answer would be appreciated. I don't know whether this post is irrelevant, but I'd appreciate some advice. I've been using in-ear earphones and my ears get tired and hurt, only a bit, within the first ten minutes. The earphones I use are quite decent I think, not expensive though. I listen at an almost satisfyingly loud volume, I don't consider it to be too loud, but after a couple of minutes the sound feels a bit muddy and my ears hurt. I always listen to music while being in a quiet room. Should I consider buying a new, more expensive pair of noise-cancelling earphones? Has the bass volume anything to do with this? Should I afford over-ear earbuds, in order to stop hurting my ears, while I listen at a somewhat loud volume, without decreasing the quality that in-ear earphones offer?"
Big ol Meeting coming up,"I work for a fairly large company as a contractor. We just acquired a new IT executive (not new to the company) in March/April. He has had a 'Team Connect' in March and late last night a new Town Hall meeting was scheduled for just contractors.   


I'm a little nervous. Mind you a previous company I worked for also did Town Hall's but it was always employee only. My director was also suprised by this Town Hall, they didn't know about it until a teammate brought it up.   


So, while I'm sure its just a normal Town Hall, I'm nervous.


UPDATE: well, found out why it was semi weird and secretive. Long story short, they only invited about 25% of there contractors because we are the core of what will be supporting the company going forward. So that's good :D"
remembered a drunken mistake and it's been eating me up,"So back in September, I was at a party and everyone there was pretty drunk (I know this is in no way an excuse for my behaviour). Basically, what I remember is that I was flirting with this guy and we had our arms around each other. My hand went down his back and I grabbed his butt. I honestly feel so guilty and ashamed about this.  I would have brought up the incident earlier and apologized, but I had no recollection of any of this until recently, when I saw a picture from that night and it got my memory jogging. It was months ago, and the two of us are friends now. To make matters worse, he is dating one of my best friends (they were not together at the time). My question is whether it would be appropriate to bring it up to him now and apologize, or if that would create drama. I'm genuinely at a loss— even if he wasn't upset about it, I feel disgusting and I hate that I treated another person like that. If anyone can offer me some perspective on the situation, that would be super helpful. Thanks."
I think some mysteries are meant to stay unsolved.,"I’m definitely a curious person, curiouser than most, so I’ve always been obsessed with anything pertaining to the unexplained and unknown. My mind has always been my safe space. I didn’t have a lot of friends growing up, so I was alone with my thoughts mostly. Any rabbit hole I could find to lose myself in, well I dived head first. If there was a van that instead of saying, “Free Candy” the van would say “Free Trip To conspiracy land and 2 free passes to Abandon Places Everywhere Land, and Drive yourself insane with no sleep unsolved mysteries treasure hunt land.” Well I already had signed permission slips with both my parents signatures on the witness line ready to go. No brainer, I would be already in the back seat bitching about the drivers cringeworthy taste in outdated one hit wonder bands. 
But hears the thing, somethings I don’t necessarily think we should mess with. Especially in the last few years, I’ve read about how so many researchers, anthropologists, and archeologists are getting more and more curious about things that don’t need to be unearthed. Case in point, the search for Cleopatra and Mark Antonys tombs. I understand it’s a piece of history, they were still people who died and were laid to rest in peace. What if one day people just decided to start digging up yours and your family’s graves In the name of whatever mainstream media is claiming it’s for? Leave the dead undisturbed, and for the love of my sanity stop destroying the discoveries that you do unearth."
I think it's just hard to get male attention period!,"I'm just not enough no matter what I do. I'm too unattractive/ugly. I'll be 28 soon and never had attention from guys and I'm still a virgin. Everytime  I even stare at a guy they either quickly look away quickly, blank their eyes real hard, or they'll project their eyes from looking my way. I'm almost always ignored. I'm just a straight up trashy looking person. I'm gross and disgusting."
They hate and yell at me,"My boss hates me and yells at me. It hurts a lot. I want to blind myself or break my neck so I do not have to work. That being said, I don't ever want to work for anyone again, everyone hates me and yells at me. 

No matter who they are, they all want to hurt me. I'm literally a worthless shit of a person. I asked them how are we going to keep this customer, and they told me I don't know, etc.  Funny bc they told me I was never allowed to say I don't know when I started. I really wanna die as a person, I truly failed. Its not that I always fail the customer (bc I sure as hell do that) it's that I fail everything I do and everything I will  do. 

I failed at socializing and communicating with others. I will absolutely never get another job after I'm let go from this one, or made to quit. And the worst part is, I never have in thirty years spoken to someone who didn't treat me like shit. 

I tried people pleasing, today I tried not people pleasing. And I'm hated all the same. I'm so lonely it physically hurts, the silence hurts. I just go to bed crying."
I had a threesome and I regret it,I don’t know what I was thinking. I feel anxious now and I didn’t realize how much I liked one of them. I also struggle with self esteem issues and I feel like maybe I’m not as pretty as her or like able or whatever. I don’t know how to process it and I don’t feel like I can say anything because it’s supposed to be casual. Would it be wrong to ghost someone after something like that?
traumatized by a remark,"When I was in the 8th grade, I had this one friend who was pretty narcissistic, I didn't know it at the time, but also because he concealed that side of him pretty well, until that day where he talked shit about me behind my back. We were assigned to a group project, when it was break time from the project, he went to talk with his other friend, I overheard him said something along the lines of ""he's useless as shit"". When it came to recess time, I confront him about it in front of others, he kept denying it, until the very end, and played victim, and I outburst in anger, so basically he gas-lighted the situation and kept saying how he already is suffering enough from his parents, now I'm making him suffer, it's crazy how narcissistic he was at this age. I'm really certain this left a scar on me, now I feel the need to overcompensate when I work with others, feel the need to not feel useless, and would really get hurt if I am ever called that again, sometimes it's so bad that I avoid any group work activities."
i feel like i'm living the wrong life,"for as long as i can remember i've hated myself. i had really bad self-esteem issues in middle school that i never really dealt with, but i just kinda kept ignoring them and used that ""fake it til you make it"" method for confidence. and it worked! my life is going great and i'm on track for a great future, except for the fact that it doesn't feel like me.

now i'm in tenth grade, i'm class president, have a 4.0+ gpa, have lots of amazing friends, have pretty decent looks, my parents are still together, and money has never been a problem. however, it feels like i'm living the wrong life. whoever this is, she's doing amazing and is on to do great things. all i know is that i just want to curl up in a ball and stop trying to be that person. i don't deserve this life, and i don't feel like trying anymore.

my dad is a heavy drinker and drug user. don't get me wrong, he's a great dad (he does get hard to be around when drunk though), and considering he drinks 3-4 nights a week and (smokes weed way more often - cocaine sometimes too), i've been exposed to this type of behavior my whole life.

now that school is getting harder, college is approaching, my self esteem issues are coming back, and i've stopped self harming to cope, literally all i can think about anymore is drinking and doing drugs in order to stop feeling this constant guilt of living someone else's life. i've never gotten drunk or high (because i'm class president, if i were to ever go to a party and get caught doing that stuff i'd get into wayyyyy more trouble than anyone else) so i don't know what it feels like. all i know is that my dad has been drinking his whole life to cope with his problems, so it must be pretty good, right? 

all i want is to stop being this preppy girl with straight As that the boys swoon over, and just get shitfaced and forget about everything. i don't want to have another sober moment where i'm aware of what's going on around me. who i am right now and what i'm doing is so much work and it feels unnatural. the guilt of being in a great life like this but not wanting to do anything with it is overwhelming. i truly believe that there was a mix up at birth and i took this life by accident. now, there is someone out there in a shitty circumstance probably hating their life, because i'm accidentally living theirs. last year i tried my best to keep going, to keep working harder, but i think this year might be the year i finally fuck it all up.

**disclaimer: i realize now after writing this that i sound super ungrateful for my life, and that's not the case! i'm super thankful for everything i have, i just feel like i don't deserve it.**"
got yelled at by some dude during Halloween,"I don't know if that was an act or not, but about several years ago on Halloween, I was walking alone down the street, trying to get some candies, when I was walking past this house nearby, and what seemed like the owner of the house, came out right to me, speed walking, and yelled out loud: ""KEEP FUCKING WALKING"", while pointing his hand to the direction I'm walking towards as if directing me to keep going, that scared me but I kept my composure and walked only a bit faster, then he quickly walked back to his house. After that night, I started wondering what I did to triggered his reaction, I don't understand why he did that to me? I was pretty young too, so that made me feel negatively towards Halloween."
Just went 1 hour to a friend's gig but didn't go in.,"Lighter than most stuff on this sub but want get this off my chest. 

Some friends of mine (which I don't see very often) have a band and had a gig in a bar and asked me if I wanted to come. I said maybe( I'm a little socially anxious so I don't like to commit in the case I don't come). So today I went about 1 hour by train to get to the bar. As I go in I see some guy I know sitting there on a table with his friends and I immediatly leave. 
I know that guy from my school time - even though we didn't really have contact - and met him at the last gig where we had just a short awkward chat before I isolated myself for the rest of the evening. 
The thought of spending the whole evening there with his friends either awkwardly trying to make conversation or just sitting there quietly like a wierd loner scared the shit out of me.

Well, just now I'm going riding home and I plan to drink a beer and play Overwatch. Feels like another evening on my road to social isolation. 
Don't take this too seriously, just need to get this off my chest.

Cheers."
"I miss my old college crush. I still have feelings for her, and just can't quit thinking about her.","Over 2 years ago. When I was in college, I met a girl I had a real connection to. Cute as a button, I honestly think she may have been ""the one"" but I never took the initiative. I liked her. A lot. After 2 years, we've gone our separate ways. We haven't talked at all, but I still have feelings for her. Strong feelings. I have always regretted it.

I actually thought i loved her. I might still, i know i still have dreams about her.

Actually, if I tell about how we met and everything, tell me, do you think I would've had a shot?

Here's how we met. It was my first year of college, there was another couple group of friends i used to hang out with in high school. They were sitting in the lobby, talking. So i joined them. She was with them. One of our friends introduced us, and said she was new in town and didn't have many friends here. We talked a bit and the next day, i saw her again, so i went up and said hello. We talked for a bit, and every day after that we would talk to each other, sometimes up to a half hour.

We were very similar. Seriously, like scary similar. It really felt like i met, like, a duplicate of myself. Except, you know, female. We were similar in a lot of ways, similar values, hobbies and even similar personalities. Plus, neither of us drove. We both got picked up by somebody. We also hate tomato, yet love ketchup and spaghetti sauce and pizza. The only difference I ever really between us was that I like anime and she doesn’t. The biggest part for me, however. Was politics. You see, i am a conservative. That's just how i've always been. Now, i've always heard about how left leaning college campuses are. I never honestly expected to run into another conservative. especially one so incredibly vocal and active about their beliefs.

I started to like her, she might have felt the same for me, i don't know for sure though. I saw a few signs, nothing certain, but still. I know she always laughed at my sense of humor. I have a very weird sense of humor, i think it's called dry humor, but i make a little ""quip"" about almost everything, and most people think it's bizarre or stupid. It's gotten me a lot of weird looks, but not her, she always bursted out laughing whenever i would. I've never really was able to make anyone laugh like that. And some of the things i said were really stupid. Our first meeting, we only learned each other's first names. The next time we met, i learned her last name. Her last name is also that of a celebrity and i just said ""Any relation to (that celebrity)"". Laughed like crazy, she asked me for mine, i told her mine, she said something about it, like what country of origin it is because i have a fairly unique last name, it's german, then i just said ""Hey, maybe next time, we can learn each others middle names"" more laughing. My celebrity impressions also got a kick out of her. Then there was the time a celebrity died, she was on her phone and said something about it, and I just remarked “well, looks like Hillary just got another vote”. But, i think most i've ever made her laugh was a joke i made. It was something about Hillary Clinton and having something fall on her. I just said ""If that happened, i wonder if her feet would curl up and slink back under it.""

Yes, my quips were stupid, but they got a laugh out of her. Every time. Everyone else gets weirded out and annoyed by my humor, but not her. They always got a laugh out of her. And I enjoyed making her laugh, she always had this cute laugh, which she’d snort. That’s the only sign I ever got from her, well that and she always tried to high five me and shake my hand if that means anything

Anyway, we were also both somewhat shy people, so i never made a move, she didn't either. And for 2-3 days a week for almost a year, we talked every time we saw each other, not just saying hi as we passed each other, but we would sit in the lobby together after class, talking as we waited for our rides to come to pick us up, which sometimes took up to a half hour. Every day, she'd talk to me, just me until her sister picked her up. About life, some favorite interests we had in common. It was really nice and I actually looked forward to it. Then there was the last day before Christmas vacation, I sat at a table, we sat at the same table and talked for almost an hour before her family came and got her. Exclusively me. She didn’t glance at her phone, except to call her family that class was over (we had our final exam that day), but it took only about 20-30 minutes and class was generally 3 hours).

We had the same math class my first semester, but the second, however, we didn’t. Our paths just crossed because we had the same schedule. I mean, I had a girl, with whom, I had a solid connection with and saw every day. But I never did anything about it. My first semester, I didn’t know her as well as I did the day before Christmas Break. I thought that would be it, but the next year we had a similar schedule again. I still didn’t do it. I wanted to, but I just couldn’t formulate the words to do it. I’d always freeze up before I could do it. I just kept telling myself “next week, I’ll surely do it next week” but weeks turned to months and before I knew it, the semester was over. She was gone the next year. She transferred to a university (it was a community college). And my chances were lost forever. I never saw her again.

She was smart, she was cute, she’s one of the few people I’ve met who actually really liked my sense of humor, she always wanted to talk to me and even approached me on her own, she seemed interested in me and I just let her get away.

i kind of miss her, and still, honestly, have some feelings for her. I am friends with her on Facebook, but have never messaged her. I mean, over 2 years has passed since that time. Since we’ve talked or communicated whatsoever. I really miss her, and letting her slip by it definitely one of my biggest regrets. In the time, she's graduated, but she hasn't posted anything about a boyfriend, getting married, or anything. She posted about how fun her summer was, but everything she posted was with her sister. I still have some slight hope that maybe I still have a shot at rectifying things, but she probably doesn’t remember me anyway. I haven’t even bothered trying.

Oh well. Thank you for reading."
Every single night I cry before bed,"I'm tired of being single, feeling unloved and empty. 

Never had a BF in my life and still a virgin at 23.

While all my ex-classmates from school and university are getting engaged/married, having children or are in stable relationships.

Why do they deserve the happiness I have been longing for years? I'm touched starved too."
Late period,"My period is 3 days late, I'm on birth control but we didnt use a condom and I'm panicking. I feel like I keep fucking up and getting pregnant is the last thing I need. I've never wanted to bleed so badly."
"Fell in love, lost my chance","Well i don´t really have someone to talk about this so here it goes. Haven´t been with someone for a long time just because im shy when we talk about love and stuff. But there was a girl i meet and we talked a lot and all that stuff, something started. As i was scared to take a step when the perfect situation happened,  i think she ended up losing interest in the relation and all went cold. Now we dont talk as before and i feel sad about it. I´m just sad because i think that all the effort will end up in nothing and i´ll be alone again just because i didn´t take the step when i should.

Probably not as important as other people bigger problems but i just wanted to write this somewhere"
Overwhelmed by my family’s secret life,"Some background info before I get started
Be me: 19 male
5 kids in my family: 3 older sisters, 2 you get brothers, I’m the older brother

Literally less than an hour ago I learned of a metric fuckton of stuff that really messed me up, and also put a lot of things into place for me. I learned that me and my younger brother were sheltered from the rest of the family’s secret life. My oldest sister who I found out is actually only my half sister from my mothers first marriage I had no idea about was, and is the coldest most manipulative psychopath (she was tested, she has no empathy, idk what else to call it) that my parents who were both marines for 20+ years have ever seen. Growing up she manipulated my other sisters into hating, despising, and making life miserable for my parents and bullying and making life miserable for them at the same time. Ending finally when the two sisters moved off to college, found therapists, and realized what was happening.  This was especially hard on my mother because while I was in my young adolescent years, somewhere roughly between the ages of 2-6, she was struggling with stage 4 breast cancer, making this whole situation quite a lot to deal with. It didn’t help that in my teen years the oldest sisters then manipulated me into hating my mom, who I now know is the most loving, caring, and forgiving woman in the world. 

Another thing, less than an hour ago I found out that once she miraculously beat the cancer that she was told was going to leave her three months to live, she was then told that if she’s lucky, in about 15 years (10-15 if she isn’t) she’s going to get cancer again, and this time it will kill her. Because with the amount of radiation and chemotherapy she had there’s no possible way she won’t get cancer again. So I can expect her to get cancer again (if they’re right) within the next few years and I will lose her. 

Anyway, this sister was someone I trusted more than anyone. She has a fiancée that I treat and feel like he’s my actual brother, and friends that I felt were the only people i could be myself around. I genuinely thought that I had a great relationship with her, and everything that I was beginning to notice was just sisters fighting and girls holding grudges. I found out that not only is that not the case, but all these years she’s been lying and spreading horrible stories about me and the rest of my family to everyone of her friends that I’d met and enjoyed time with, and to her fiancée that I love like a brother, and to anyone who will listen really. So not only did I just lose someone I thought loved me and I had a great relationship with, I know I’m gonna lose my mom soon too. This sister also continues to manipulate my still clueless you get brother who is just starting Highschool. She somehow manipulated him into giving her a computer that he had built himself by saving up for the parts by finding any kind of work he could do for neighbors, our parents or anyone growing up. And uses her relationship with him to come over to my parents house, act friendly and either steal something or brag and strut off her success in some validation seeking act. 

I don’t know how to feel. Mostly I feel sad that 1. I didn’t appreciate my mom who has only ever loved and supported me with all her heart and now it might be too late and 2. Someone I thought was my best friend, a person whom I trusted my entire life, betrayed, lied to and hated me. And continues to abuse my family through my younger brothers innocence. 

I just had to vent"
I forget things too easily and I feel stupid at times because of it.,"I'll be in a conversation with someone about, say, a new movie. I'll be talking about a scene I thought was cool, get distracted by something moving (like a person, dog, bug, etc.) Then totally forget what i was talking about. Like it takes a lot of mental energy just to remember what I was talking about. You can probably imagine how awkward it makes the conversation.

It seems like a funny thing I do, but what bothers me is that it happens a lot. So much so, I've forgotten what I've been talking about when talking to professionals (i.e. in my field). I fear one day I'll give a presentation and totally forget what I'm talking about. Making a complete fool of myself."
The reality that my life dream isnt going to happen is beginning to sink in,"So this is going to be a long post, so sry. I'm a 15 yo male and a junior in high school and I've been inspired by Steve Irwin since I was a few years old. It's been my unchanged dream to live in Australia and work in wildlife conservation. But I'm starting to realize that its never going to happen for a few reasons. I can't afford to get any decent higher education, my dad is very rich but I'm basically not his kid anymore since I chose my mom over him because he was physically abusive and he told me to never expect a dime from him. I'd consider myself to be somewhat bright, I make straight A's in average classes, but there are kids who are ten times smarter than me in the higher classes and they would get a scholarship over me in a heartbeat. Right now I'm looking at a steady job as a coder, it pays well and is pretty easy work. But I know that that won't make me happy and that being a conservationist is what I've always wanted. I've always thought about how lucky people like the Irwin kids are who were bound to get my dream before they were old enough to want it. I've been so depressed, but it's not like I hate myself it's the fact that I hate what my future is looking like. I know everyone has big plans when they are young but I really wanted this more than anything."
I feel like a fuck up college at 24,"I have been following all the ""rules"" my entire life and been barely getting by. I am in college at 24 and I just want to be done with school already. It is pointless to take these miserable classes just to get a stupid thing of paper that says I am in debt 45k and failed this many classes just to pass by the skin of my teeth again. I know that we all have to try in order to succeed in life but no matter how hard I try I always make it by a few points or in my college case I have no more room for failure in my degree so maybe this time I will fail. I just want all this to stop hurting my brain. I burnt myself out trying to get good grades and I never want to experience that again."
I am a jerk and I am not quite shure how to change,"Simply said I have been told that I am an ok person to talk to but I have the tendency to correct people and I can't accept opinions without expressing my own opinion and showing why it is better. It is a bad characteristic that I can work on. Does anybody else have a similar problem. I suppose I have to understand that I am not superior to other people, but for some reason it is quite hard for my dumb brain to grasp"
"I've found cures to my allergies and my depression, but they aren't FDA approved.","Back when I was younger, my allergies were treated for about 6 months by an at the time experimental treatment called sublingual immunotherapy. I was cured temporarily, but was unable to finish the treatment. I had my allergies come back and come back worse.

Again, I had a breakthrough recently, only this time my anxiety and depression got significantly better after taking Plan B when a condom broke.

There is no long term version of Plan B, only medications similar or in tandem with other medications. I tried a medication (Lessina) with a lower dose and it made my depression and anxiety worse. I believe this is due to the estrogen included in Lessina worsening my anxiety.

I'm so incredibly depressed right now.

I'm going in to talk to my boss tomorrow and I'm fairly certain he is letting me go due to my poor attendance.

I got in a car accident the other day and even with my low paying job, I don't have the income to pay for the deposit for repairs. Without it, I don't have any chance to afford repairs.

Having any job at all makes me so anxious and depressed that I lose all interest in anything except sleeping.

I'm tired of learning the way to relief for me is not possible. I'm tired of trying every single day only to fall harder than I could imagine. My car is under my sister's name so I could get the loan and I don't want to burden her when I'm unable to pay for it soon.

I'm tired of burdening my friends that I live with. 

I just want to be gone."
Best friend having self worth issues,"hey so basically my best friend is struggling to accept that he's wanted and not a disappointment to his friends and family and I've told him of how much he isn't and that he's great. he also told me that he has suicidal tendencies when drunk and that worries me. 

I've asked him if he might be depressed but he denied it so I ask if he could be bipolar instead since he says that his moods about himself constantly change like he could be happy and then sad at the same time and he denied that too. I asked him if he could consider taking those online tests but he didn't reply and hasn't since like a few days ago.

something to note however is that he always just reads but never replies to my texts since even way before which annoys me but that's not the main point. anyways, he has since then tweeted more sad stuff but im not sure what else to do really except to give him space"
I didn't get to experience HS graduation or prom,"I was dealing with mental health problems during HS so I ended up skipping lots of classes and eventually dropped out/expelled of HS, now I'm planning on finishing HS education through online courses, but it sucks that I'll never get to experience prom, or the graduation ceremony, especially with my buddies from elementary and high school. I seen some of them posted videos of their graduation on social media, even at the moment where they all threw their academic hat into the air, it makes me feel jealous and left out. It made me feel better when one of my mates said he didn't go to prom, but he still went to the graduation ceremony, I even saw him in the video, I wish I was there, fml. Their families were probably so proud of them, seeing them receiving their diplomas, while I'm here at home dropped out good for nothing."
The girl I have been seeing told me we need to stop talking because she needs time... and the thing that hurts me is that I will not be able to see her cat anymore if everything falls apart,"She has this fat ass cat that lives in her family house. I met her twice and thought she was super adorable. She’s a character, she’s sweet and she rocks. The girl I’ve been hanging out with (her owner) is als sweet and cool but she told me yesterday that she needs time and that we can’t talk that often anymore for multiple reasons. I don’t know if it’s weird to say that I will miss seeing her cat. She’s just so adorable she warms my heart. 

The only thing I have left is a collection of pics I got of her cat. She sent me those long time ago and everytime I see ‘em it makes my day (is it weird I have a bunch of pics of her cat? I don’t care if you say yes).

"This is ruining my life, I am such a pushover","Why am I like this? I've always been that person who says ""whatever is the best for you"" when someone asks me if I prefer x or y. And I also don't know what I would prefer, so I let others decide for me. It's like I am afraid of making the wrong decision and I can't handle the consequences. I have always been like that, since I was a child, teachers used to tell me that I should accept error as a part of life, and I know that, but still I just can't change my behavior. Also I don't trust myself either, I always think that the others opinion or way to do something is right/better and mine is wrong/worse. I just can't stand this anymore, I don't know what to do to change this. I have been doing therapy for 3 years now and it doesn't seem to help. "
So Many little things are adding up,"First my friend from work announces she's found another job and will be leaving, the same time as another work friend is leaving, meaning soon I won't have any work friends left. Next my sister tells me she doesn't want me to come to her bachelorette party because ""she won't feel comfortable and will be worrying about me."" She is planning a weekend trip to a cool city I've never been to with 10 girls and I was really looking forward to it.  I'm feeling a lot of pressure at work from my boss to be more productive so I've been working late most days. When I ask co-workers for help I feel like I'm annoying them. Today I asked a co-worker for his opinion on an issue I was having, and he snapped at me and told me I was stupid and making things harder than they needed to be. I turned bright red and my eyes were welling up for the rest of the day. I tried to vent to my mom about how I've been feeling, and she snapped at me and told me I only make her stressed and she has too much going on to deal with me. I feel like an embarrassment and a burden to everyone in my life.

I'm a sad boy today : (,"I just lost one of my best clients : (

I kinda messed up a job

I apologized and offered to do anything they may think necessary to regain their trust,

but I'm not hopeful

Update: Not so sad anymore!

They decided to give me another chance, I will have to do a smaller job, as a test, and Insisted to do it free of cost, to show that I'm serious about it,

I'm doing this right!"
Moving back to my country after 5 years,"Im leaving to the airport in 10 days, after 5 years of pretty much growing up + becoming legal here. From high school to a year of uni, I had host families who are the world, giving me a family that I never had (crappy home environment) and the best host parents who were pretty much my 2nd mother and father. The friends that I've made here are the closest people who were always there for me. And now, after dropping out of uni prematurely, I'm going back to the country I left at 15.

It didn't kick in until I stared face to face at the airplane ticket. Before I was ecstatic finally chasing my dream of joining the army, and that I can keep in touch with friends via social media. I was nowhere close to sad, but euphoric. Even telling myself that I won't shed any tears. However, it's only these few days having visited some friends where I had started falling apart. I couldn't stop crying when I hugged my host mom a farewell. I couldn't stop crying when I realise that I'm also leaving the warmness behind. 

It wasnt just the friends that I'm missing, it's the world around me. My every day life. The jolly breeze of Australia. The culture of individuality and carefreeness. People that actually care for one another. All gone when I return to Singapore. 

Now, I still can't stop crying. I know that this would be the best decision of my life, but I essentially grew up here. Home was Australia , not Singapore. Heck, I remember most of my life here, and these 5 years were the most impactful. This was the place that had moulded me into the person I am now. Everything hurts. I didnt realised how much I loved it here until I have to leave. Now, here I am trying to be positive about my new upcoming chapter in my life, while I can't let go of the current chapter that's about to come to an end.

 I'm going to miss my forever home. Gosh I'm going to dread that airport goodbye. It's just so difficult. "
Do y'all ever look at your life and wonder who screwed you up?,Yeah...me too.
