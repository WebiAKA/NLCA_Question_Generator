"It feels silly to celebrate; but I got out of bed, showered, and dressed before the sun went down today! üòä","I stopped taking my meds last week (adderall) because my tolerance grew and I don‚Äôt want to up my dosage. 

Ever since, I‚Äôve been experiencing the worst depression I‚Äôve had in forever. The rollercoaster I‚Äôve been riding for the last week brought me to the point of wanting to just end it all a few nights ago. 

I was feeling really guilty this morning for what I have been putting my loved ones through. I almost fell back to where I was a couple of nights ago. But instead, I got out of bed, and just took a shower. Now I‚Äôm laying in my moms bed. I haven‚Äôt said anything to her. But I‚Äôm feeling a lot better now. And I was able to avoid the longing to end my life.  

Thank you all for your posts in this sub. I stumbled on it this morning and it motivated me enough to get me out of bed. I didn‚Äôt even have the strength to move before. 

I‚Äôm so happy that I wanted to share my excitement with someone. But no one else would understand how something so small could mean so much to someone like me. Thank you again! "
Tonight I showered and got all of the knots out of my hair,"I struggle with depression. Just like a lot of you. I go long periods of time without showering. I like to stay in bed until I have to go to work then go to bed right when I get home. Repeat.  It happens. I have long curly hair and wear it up in a bun on top of my head. And I sleep with it like that. And it gets so knotted up I can‚Äôt get them out. So whenever I shower, (every 3 weeks usually...it‚Äôs awful, I know. This time it‚Äôs been since Christmas. ) I brush out as much as I can but leave the rest because I get tired. Well tonight, I brushed as much out as I could before getting in, and got the hard ones while I was washing it. It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt really seem like an accomplishment, but I‚Äôm pretty damn proud of myself. They can get so bad to the point I would just want to shave my head. To make it easier. But tonight, I won the battle. 

Whatever battle you may be fighting, keep fighting. Things will eventually turn up the way you want. It may take time, but be patient with it. You will be okay. 

I washed my hair tonight."
Has Anyone Else Feel Like They Have Become Less Intelligent After Dealing with Depression...,"Sorry, this is my first reddit post, I'm fairly new to the community. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

&#x200B;

Like (presumably) a lot of people, I felt as if I was incredibly smart growing up. I was able to start school early when I was younger, I had a near perfect GPA, I painted, I played multiple instruments, and my parents were pushing me to apply for top schools. My future looked really bright.

However, in the middle of senior year (of high school), something felt really wrong, and everything began to fall apart (lol, that sounds overly dramatic...but just know that I really was not in the right state of mind). I couldn't get up to eat, I cried at random times at school, **(warning for triggering visualization? not sure if this would count as one) \*\*** I began to harm myself a lot (like I mostly beat my legs or arms with objects), and I was just deep into depression. I tried to commit suicide multiple times, **\*\***

&#x200B;

Like I've experienced periods of sadness before this, but never as intense and for an entire year.

Luckily, I did well enough in school before all of this happened, so I was awarded a scholarship to let me go to community college for free‚Äî so I didn't completely self-sabotage my future. So I've been working on transferring for the past year.

&#x200B;

However, I'm so distraught. I feel like my intelligence has gone down the drain. I slur when I talk, I developed a bit of a lisp, I can't coordinate my actions to my thoughts, I even forget letters when writing (for example, I would write ""oadside"" instead of ""roadside"" or ""mozzera"" instead of ""mozzerella""). I feel so, so disappointed in myself and it's ruining my self esteem. I even had to say the phrase ""I want to know what I originally got on my essay"" three times the other day to my professor because I couldn't remember how to say it, and he looked at me really funny.

&#x200B;

Is this normal?? Like I said, it's ruining my self esteem completely, and I feel like I'll never be the person I once was. I'm starting to relapse back into my depression because I feel so worthless, and I feel like I don't know what to do. I've tried reading more, downloading cognitive supporting apps (like Luminosity?), and I've been sleeping okay and drinking lots of water. But I don't know. Has anyone experienced something like this and was able to rework themselves back to the person they originally were? If so, how did you do it?

Or am I doomed to plummet even further than I am now...

Sorry if this question seemed pretentious or if I seemed pretentious in any way."

Gentle Reminder to Brush Your Teeth,"Had to go to the dentist due to an abcess and a tooth needing an immediate root canal. Went back and they are now saying 3k for all the work needed. 

Ill be making it through the treatment and payment plans over the next forever. 

But this is a gentle reminder to brush your teeth or swish some mouth wash. 

Been in a bad spell of depression for the last year and a half but Im in therapy now and we will see how it helps. But like many I stopped doing anything to take care of myself
 This is the hardest to break out of but seeing this as my result is upsetting. Knowing there is a solution is helpful. I just have to make it through to the end"
If you‚Äôve forgotten/been unable to brush your teeth in a long time.,"If you‚Äôve been unable to brush your teeth in a long time you may have developed mild gum disease. If that‚Äôs the case brushing for the first time will lead to bleeding and discomfort.

If you‚Äôre really struggling just buy some mouth wash, the cheapest I‚Äôve seen is 70p for a normal bottle. Using this just once a day can be a start.

When you can start brushing your teeth Use sensitive toothpaste such as sensodyne toothpaste. It will hurt a lot less and claims to repair damage. 

If it hurts, stop! When I‚Äôve been at my worse I had to build up from mouth wash to 30 seconds then adding 10 seconds each time until I built up to 2 mins and then flossing.

If you start to floss, use sensitive floss and don‚Äôt do it straight away after a long time, it can make the bleeding worse. Work up to flossing.

I tried to find this advice a few years ago but no one is really open about it so I thought I‚Äôd share. Good luck!

I just read about a poor little 10 year old boy who committed suicide because he was bullied and I ask all of you to please keep him in your thoughts because he was one of us.,"This morning, I read about a little boy who has had more than 26 surgeries and had to carry a colostomy bag around with him. 

Kids at his school bullied him almost daily because of it, often going as far as assaulting him and yelling racial slurs at him. 

His family said he often prayed for his bullies and never fought back when they attacked him.  

Well, he hung himself, a 10 year old boy knew how to hang himself. This poor little innocent child will never see what a beautiful life he had ahead of him because his bullies thought it was so hilarious to attack something he could not control.

We are all in this sub reddit because we have faced, are facing depression, pain, mental disorders. Some of us may have faced bullies in our lives. And those ‚Äúbullies‚Äù are all facing problems of their own causing them to lash out at others. And unfortunately, they are causing so much pain for those who do not deserve it.

So today, I am asking all of you to please keep this little boy in your thoughts because he was one of us, and unfortunately the pain was too much for his innocent soul. If any of you are facing problems that you feel are too big for you to handle. Please seek help. Reach out to those around you because I would not be here today if I didn‚Äôt make the decision to seek help.

Does anyone else just not want to be alive but isn‚Äôt actively suicidal?,"So I‚Äôve just been feeling really depressed in a really long time. I would say last year I was extremely suicidal and I was on the verge of ending my life. But then it got complicated I got help and blah blah... I thought my meds were working after I reached a therapeutic level of 125mg of Zoloft but I‚Äôm not sure anymore. These overwhelming feelings are coming back. 

I mean I‚Äôm not actively suicidal or anything. But then today my sister asked me where I wanted to live in the future, and the first thing that cam to mind is that I didn‚Äôt want even live. I‚Äôm just so tired of this perpetual cycle of shit. It‚Äôs really getting draining.

 Anyways does anyone else feel this way, dead inside a little I guess. And do you guys think my meds aren‚Äôt working? I was okay until like 4 PM today. I would appreciate your opinion.

And I‚Äôm totally fine so you don‚Äôt need to message me, please save it for someone in urgent need! I am receiving regular therapy and am well supported :)"
?,Does anyone else feel like they are okay one day and then another day just sink into a hole of darkness again?
"If you don‚Äôt have the energy to do something, try taking a micro-step","Many people with depression obviously lack energy, ambition and motivation. Thinking about accomplishing large tasks can trigger anxiety, which causes depression, which causes anxiety, and so on. It‚Äôs counter productive to think about the large task you have to do.

A solution I found helpful for this problem is to take micro steps. Just do the tiniest step you can towards that goal you have, and don‚Äôt be embarrassed by how small it is.

For instance, if you want to lose weight, exercising is an obvious goal, but it can sound so painful and atrocious that you simply refuse to do it. On the other hand, you could effortlessly do a single push-up (or whatever exercise is effortless for you) at this moment. *boop.* It is done. You did it. It took 3 seconds. It didn‚Äôt hurt. 

You may be thinking, ‚Äúoh wonderful, now I‚Äôve done a push up, I‚Äôm still nowhere near my goal of losing 50 pounds!‚Äù Yet, what I‚Äôve found with micro-steps is they build momentum: 

- Even if I only do one push-up, I‚Äôm better off than where I just was. 

- Then, upon realizing one push-up was so easy yesterday, I can do another push-up tomorrow. It is still extremely easy. 

- Then I do one push-up every day for a week. It‚Äôs still extremely easy. 

- Then I do TWO pushups every day for a week. Still extremely easy. And hey 14 pushups a week ain‚Äôt too shabby. 

- Then I decide I‚Äôm going to add one more push-up every day of the week (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). It‚Äôs still easy. It‚Äôs just *one more* than I *yesterday*, which was easy. 

- then I do this for two weeks (14 push-ups at the end). I reach day 14 and while it‚Äôs no longer as easy as one push-up, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm proud of now and I don‚Äôt want to break my streak. I‚Äôm doing hundreds of pushups a month now.. I hadn‚Äôt done a single push-up in years before this started. It‚Äôs still nowhere near as hard as I originally imagined. It hurts for a minute, then I get a body high. It‚Äôs enjoyable overall. Wow, I see why people like this! Unbelievable. People are complimenting me for looking healthier. Unbelievable. I feel healthier. Cant stop this now, it‚Äôs working!

- then, a few months later I do this for 3 weeks

- then 4 weeks..

- and so on... 

I repeated this pattern and I‚Äôm currently up to doing 150 pushups 3x per week. I put on a podcast and take my time and don‚Äôt even think twice about it. It‚Äôs mildly annoying and then it feels great when I‚Äôm down. 

I have the strength to do 150 pushups a day now because I wasn‚Äôt ashamed to do that one pushup 5 years ago. If I hadn‚Äôt done that one push-up, I probably would have never done *anything*. Taking the tiny micro step of manifesting your goals can build momentum that you desperately need when you‚Äôre in a depression funk. Without any momentum you feel like there is no purpose. You are like a flower blocked from the sun. But even a small amount of sunlight can change everything, causing you to grow into places where you can effortlessly reach more sunlight. 

This also works for tasks you have to get done in the short term. Have a paper due tomorrow? First thing in the morning, just open up Microsoft word. You‚Äôll think ‚Äúwell that was easy, I took the first step.‚Äù Then you will consider how hard the second step is: a title. Not hard. Now you‚Äôve done something. And it‚Äôs only 7am. I‚Äôll take an hour break and then write some outlines... then I‚Äôll write a sentence. ..Then a paragraph... this is actually not so bad... 

once you take that first step of that opening Microsoft word, things stop seeming so daunting. Everything gets put into better perspective when you manifest your thoughts into actions, even in the most microscopically small way."
You know what?,"Tomorrow when I wake up I will brush my hair, I will also wash my face and teeth.

I will praise myself for it.

I will kick depressions ass, because you know what? I am in control of myself.

I will rebel against my own brain chemicals, because fuck you.

I declare war, you might win this fight, depression, but honey I will win the war."
"I wanted to kill myself, now I'm the happiest I've ever been... My Battle with depression.","I made a video on my YouTube channel talking about my lowest point and talking about this wasn't easy but I feel that I had to share it and overcome it. I was in a place where I was genuinely tired of living. After lots and lots of trial and error, I pulled myself out of that and now I am the happiest I've ever been. I became a YouTuber. No not famous of ""successful"" by other people's standards, but I use my platform to talk about mental health, self-growth, and I challenge my audience to get out of their comfort zone, because the more you experience the more you grow as a person. When you grow as a person you start to identify who you are, what you like and what actually makes you happy, inevitably ""curing your depression"" I've seen this work so many times but I was too blind to notice it while I was suffering, then I dedicated myself to study philosophy and psychology. I make films trying to help people and as long as I can affect someone positively, I consider that success.

I‚Äôm kind of embarrassed by how much taking care of a cat has improved my mental health.,"So I‚Äôve dealt with chronic depression my whole life, I have a lot of strategies to help and I‚Äôm almost in my thirties, I‚Äôm proud that I‚Äôve become pretty functional. But I still have dark days or weeks or sometimes months, and I know I will again in my life. But I can go to work, get along well with my co-workers and clients, and don‚Äôt let things spiral until my life implodes like I used to. Always reminds me of a line from a song by the naked and famous:

‚ÄúThere are certain things
That I have to do.
Day to day just to keep it at bay,
You wouldn‚Äôt believe if you knew‚Äù

And I‚Äôve been doing okay with that. But I let things in my personal life, the parts I can keep private or aren‚Äôt a ‚Äúbig deal‚Äù slip consistently. My room is always a mess, I let my beard get big and bushy even though I (and everyone I know) thinks it looks much better trimmed, leave bills unpaid too long, the usual put off until tomorrow what I could do today sort of stuff. And not even to do fun stuff, I just kind of dither and worry about the things I‚Äôm not doing. 

A few weeks ago a cat just kind of showed up in my life. One of my roommates left the place and didn‚Äôt take his cat with him, the lease holder wanted to give him to the humane society but dragged his feet about it. The cat decided I was his person now, started following me around like a puppy and meowing pathetically if I didn‚Äôt let him hang out in my room. I was reluctant to adopt him because I was raised to believe pets are a ride or die engagement, and I wasn‚Äôt sure I was ready for the commitment. Finally the lease holder said he was going to take him to the humane society that afternoon, I said bye to him with some sadness, and went to work. but he had only been ‚Äúmy cat‚Äù for a week so I figure better he go sooner before he got too attached. He‚Äôs an adorable sweet boy and only a year old so I didn‚Äôt think he would languish too long and he was being taken to a no-kill shelter.

While I was at work it really stuck in my craw. I just kept imagining the poor little guy sitting in a cage and not knowing why he had been brought there or what would happen next. But when I got home he was still there! I decided screw it, he‚Äôs my cat now. Told my roommates I‚Äôd take responsibility for him and dubbed him Jonesy, cause he looks like the cat from alien.

I‚Äôve been taking care of him for about 3 weeks and my life has improved In pretty much every way. There is the mental health improvement from having an animal around, he‚Äôs a very affectionate cat. he waits for me by the door when he hears my car park like a dog, and he pretty much always wants to cuddle. But there is also the improvement from having something to take care of. I‚Äôve been keeping my room clean because he will try to play with anything that crinkles or clanks, so empty cans or bags of chips or whatever are a no go. I always actively
play with him when I get home from work, and just focusing on being present for that period of time and doing nothing but interacting with the cat (I don‚Äôt answer text, listen to music, watch TV, I just play with Jonesy) is very calming and centering. Cleaning my room has expanded into just taking better care of myself in general. I‚Äôm drinking less, flossing twice a day, keeping the beard neat. I usually feel like all the little things I don‚Äôt do are constantly piling up, but right now for the first time in my life I feel like I‚Äôm catching up.

I‚Äôm straight up embarrassed by how much I love this animal. He‚Äôs my little fuzzy rock in a sea of chaos. I can‚Äôt control much in the world but I can give this little bastard the best goddamn cat life a cat can have. I know there will still be some dark times ahead but I feel like I have a new ally in the daily struggle. Just wanted to rant about my cat and feeling good for the first time in awhile, thanks for reading!

"Wearing My ""Social Mask"" Exhausts Me","I feel like I'm losing my ability to cope with being around people. Even those I like and am friends with?

Since I don't live with my mom or my dad, I live with my married sister and her family. My parents visit me a few times a year, and recently, my mom was able to come over to Cali since the state she lived in was going to close due to Covid, and she wanted to take advantage of this time and spend more time with me. She comes over, goes into quarantine for 14 days, and everything peachy.

Well, when my mom realized I was still hurting myself, she got really concerned, and made it her life's mission to help me get out of this depression, which I had lied about and said ""I'm fine."" Dear Mom, I want to let you know that I really love and appreciate you, but for some reason, I just can't bring myself to tell you. I'm sorry.

Within the several days, my mom *really* tried to help me. But I was always bitchy towards her, saying I was fine, and I yelled at her. My mom, she cried sometimes, but she just didn't let me see her doing that. But I could always hear it. And being me, I couldn't swallow down the part of me that hated her, for leaving me and making me grow up faster than all my friends, who had happy families and happy parents, and had the love and emotional support they needed from their own. I was always the one that stuck out, who had to depend on friends instead of my guardians, because they always insisted they were right, and I was wrong. I could never bring myself to talk to the people who supposedly loved me because I always feel like they're lying, that it's their obligation to take care of me, and that they only view me as a waste of space and money and *so much time.* 

I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger I'd hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband. We don't get along, and they always gang up on me, saying how my best friend did this better than me, I was always so bad at this or that, or how I was so fake and I always lied to them. They say other things too.

My mom started this nightly ritual for me, and it really helps. She'd take Vaseline, which would help heal wounds, and she'd spread it all over my arm where I'd hurt myself. Then after that she takes this long see-through sash, and she'd tie and secure it on my arm so I don't pick at my wounds and scabs at night, because I do that a lot just so I could feel the pain. But every time in the morning and afternoon, I'd always reopen and add more cuts and pinches onto my arms. This really stresses out my mom because I never stop, even if she really begs me to. I just get mad at her and say that it helps me.

Today, I had gotten into a pretty bad argument with my sister and brother-in-law. The previous night, I snuck my iPad into my room (no electronics in my room), and I stayed up till 4 am playing and talking with friends, who were pulling an all-nighter. It was fun, until my brother in law read my messages without me know and he found out. He got really pissed, and they enforced my already strict parental controls on my iPad, and now I can only strictly use it for a few hours at a time. They also deleted a few of my apps they didn't like me using because they didn't use it and found it a waste of time (the apps were things like TikTok and some games). While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it. I got really stressed, and I couldn't vent because I could only text on my iPad and computer (which was in the living room, and I didn't want to see their faces). So I resorted to using the back of a scissor blade, and ran it back and forth on my arm with all the scabs, and I scraped off the scabs + 2-3 layers of skin. It wasn't bleeding much, so I just cleaned it and let it dry. 

Then when my mom called me to go on a family walk, I flat out refused, and I started yelling at her for never understanding me, and how fucked up I always felt, and how tired I was (I had cried a few times earlier) and I just wanted to never see their faces for the rest of the day. Then my mom saw my arm, and she just left the room. Then around 2-3 minutes later, I hear my sister freaking out about my mom having a bloody nose. A few moments later, my mom started spitting out blood, and that's when we decided to bring her to the ER.

On the return trip from the ER, my sister just glares at me and says how the blood was triggered due to stress, and how we were lucky it was only some blood, since she could've gotten a stroke. My mom starts trying to explain to me that it wasn't my fault, but she just starts tearing up in the middle of it. Of course, that's the last thing me and my sister want, so we just shut up and try to comfort her before something else happens.

Then at home, after I had taken a shower and was trying not to cry as I explained the whole situation to my best friends, my mom just comes out of the room with Vaseline and sash in hand. She starts binding my arm, even though I was the one who caused her to be so sick, and she acted like nothing happened and tried to comfort me as I started shaking.

I feel so bad. I don't know what to do anymore, and I'm just wondering if my mom really needs a child like me. Maybe she's better off with my older sister and her perfect husband and perfect child. I stand out in the picture anyways."
It kills me to see others in worse positions than I am. You matter. You all matter and it doesn't matter what your depression or suicidal thoughts tell you.,"I'm in a similar boat with all of you, but suicide isn't the way out, and self-harm doesn't help. Everyone I know who's self-harmed tell me not to do it. Your life matters. I know it doesn't seem like it does, I know you're being told something entirely the opposite, but theres always light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how long that tunnel is. It doesn't matter how many times you fail, what matters is if you give up on yourself. Please, you do, in fact, matter. You are, in fact, worth something. Hold onto whatever makes you wanna live, no matter how small or insignificant that thing might be, its still worth living for. If your family wouldn't care, if you don't have friends, if you feel as if not a single soul cares about what happens to you, at least know that I'd care. Alot of people I knew were depressed or suicidal, and things got better for them.

&#x200B;

Please. Do SOMETHING. Go on a walk, for example. It doesn't have to be a big one, it could be just around the block or up and down your sidewalk. Or you could read a book, or do a small workout, etc. I know it seems pointless, but these things help improve your mood. I'm speaking from experience.

Eat something.  Don't starve yourself. It only worsens the pain.

&#x200B;

You have to force yourself out of this. I know, all you feel like you're capable of doing is lying in bed, but it won't ever get better if you don't break the cycle. I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you really wanna wake up every morning wanting to die? I don't think any of us enjoy it. Do you really wanna die, or do you just want these thoughts and feelings to cease? Vent in the comments of this post if you want. I don't mind.

&#x200B;

Talk to someone, anyone. You can even talk to me if you want to. Your life matters. Your feelings matter. Don't end it. Please. YOU MATTER."
Have you ever realized you have done nothing for hours,"Have you ever been in bed or on the couch and just realized that you have done nothing all day? What do you do to change that?

"""I am not always very attached to being alive"" | An Article About Passive Suicidal Idealization","My girlfriend just sent me [this post](https://theoutline.com/post/7267/living-with-passive-suicidal-ideation).

She and I both teeter the line of depression and sometimes, I find myself unable to understand her. My depression comes out in bursts and tears and when it's happening, it's easy to see and hear and feel. For her, I think it's something different. She told me this article really put her feelings into words and made her feel like someone else understood and that someone else was facing the same feelings she was.

I wanted to share it here so that others could see it and maybe be comforted by those words as well.

I hope you are all doing well, genuinely and truly, and that something is making you smile today.

My friend killed himself after 8 failed attempts over many years. Don't always trust their parents alone to do the right thing cause sometimes they just don't; they make it worse.,"I'm 23 now, it's been a couple years since he died and I can't help but remember him on occasion whenever I experience something new or good in life. I just think ""if he didn't end it all he'd have seen the bigger picture eventually"". It's never as simple as that but at the same time, it is; it's all about the timing.

  He had it all. He was popular, had that ripped body everyone envied him for, had the attention of the ladies and had a wealthy family. None of that seems to matter one bit when it concerns clinical depression. It only got worse with whatever his dad thought was the best response which was to initially send him to live in another country thinking a change of scenery was all he needed after his first few attempts, that didn't really work either. His dad's solution was to just deal with it like a man ought to and so my friend confided in his grandfather instead of his own parents. This one time he jumped off the fourth floor of his house (wealthy family like I said) and only survived cause he landed on his car. Shattering his skull and shoulder blades, he was back up and walking in a few months. The guy was a tank, a kick boxer and at the peak of his physique so he seemed to oddly survive his various attempts. 

  Things settled when he got into a stable relationship for a few years and we grew out of touch but I heard he was doing well and had left the country with his significant other. The last thing I heard after that was how his grandfather had died and that they found he had hanged himself a few days after the funeral. His family didn't even tell his friends about it, they just had a quick and quiet funeral for him the next day and I only found out about it months later. 

  That was the end of his story but it doesn't have to be for so many others out there. Please seek professional help for you or for those you know are going through cycles of depression. The worst way to deal with it is to leave it to conservative families that care more about impressions and ""manning up"" than being humble enough to band together when one is hurting and be supportive and nurturing."
im jealous of developed countries,"sorry for any bad grammar, i didnt feel like fixing any mistakes

im jealous of people living in developed countries, i really am.

i was born in a joke of a country in africa, its just like the usual, crap healthcare, shitty education, corrupt government, locked in neverending wars, blah blah, and im not really sure what i can do about it,

they had somesort of revolution recently but itll probably take years before any real changes happen

everybody is living like shit but theyre all so hopeful about the revolution for some reason, im not really sure why

its amazing thery all so hopeful even though everbody lives like crap, im really jealous, i wish i could feel the same way

and my family has been really helpful so far, giving me a bed to sleep in, food to eat and such even though everything is so expensive for them , i dont feel that im grateful enough, and theres alsso people living worse than me so i dont have any right to feel sad

the country is sudan if that helps

im attending a really crappy uni for medical school that i really dont care about, it doesnt have a professional looking website even

and the lecture halls are really small, it doesnt look anything like i saw in moviees and such

apparently if you can get a medical degree or an engineering one, you can work outside if you get really good grades, even in super advanced countres like australia or canada, but you have to pass some sort of really diffcult exam before you can get accepted and that worries me, because i dont think i can get motivated enough anyway to study for it

im really jealous of westerners, they have everything they could ever want

they have cool things like museums and space obsevatories and such, ive always wanted to go to one of these, or maybe a movie theater, ive never been in one before, while here we have nothing

im sorry for rambling and my really crappy grammar, i just wrote whatever was on my mind and i dont really care about revising

thanks, just writing this down after bottling it up for so long feels really liberating, i feel so much better already, and usually im not in this much of a bad mood, ill probably get over it in the morning

________________________________

Edit :

Sorry about the delay, I was a bit embarrassed to check this account after rambling for so long, and I was afraid I wouldn't get any replies...

Thank you so much for replying, everyone! I really can't find the words to express how I feel.

All that I can say is thank you, and I hope you get through all your problems as well.

Finding some sort of medium to talk about my problems, especially in a country that doesn't take mental health seriously at all, it honestly feels amazing.

It's just like some of you have said, people in developed countries can definitely suffer too. It's always a good idea to put yourself in other people shoes and see what they're going through. Even if they're much better off than I am, they can still be depressed, and that's okay.

There are also people far worse than I am, even in developed countries, and that's also okay.

Thank you for reminding me about perspective, and once again, thank you for replying. It really means a lot to me."
I‚Äôve skipped 2 whole weeks of class and still don‚Äôt feel like going,"I‚Äôve been absolutely drained mentally. I tried liking college and studying but I just feel like I need some time off. Problem is: I don‚Äôt want to disappoint my parents. They‚Äôre the best and deserve much better. I just don‚Äôt have any motivation at all to get up at 6 am, shower at 6:30, go to class at 8:30 and sit between strangers until 6 pm and be home at 7 pm.

Why am I always super depressed after having a fun day?,"I don't have fun very often, but when I do, after it ends I end up getting super depressed and down afterwards. Even if it's something minor, like going to someone's house. Does anyone else experience this? What's the explanation?

My friend saved my life yesterday and she doesn't know it.,"This is my first post to reddit, first time using it really. I just wanted to put this out there because I can't bring myself to tell anyone I actually know. And I'm not looking for sympathy or attention either.. I knew what I was doing. Yesterday had been one of my low points. One of the lowest in my life. I suffer from depression and lately it's been really hard. My fiance doesn't understand how someone can be depressed. She thinks that I should just choose to not be and so talking to her is impossible. I have friends, really great friends might I add, that would listen and be there for me but they all have things going on in their lives and I wouldn't want to burden them with my problems. My family loves me too but I hardly reach out to them so I definitely don't want the one time I finally do to be about my issues. I know I know, it's the depression talking right? But anyways, I was home alone yesterday and I just couldn't climb out of the hole I'd been in. Me and my fiance were fighting really bad and I didn't know what else to do. I sat on the bed and pulled out the gun in her nightstand and looked at it for awhile. I kept putting it up to my head and back down again. I was terrified and angry at myself for feeling scared. I finally put it up to my head and sat there for a minute longer. As my finger finally went to the trigger I got a text from my friend Brooke. It literally said this, ""Hey friend, thinking about you, and I love you so much. Thanks for dealing with my nonsense :) you're an amazing human."" Now granted we hadn't been texting that day and I can't make this up. I literally got it the moment I decided to end it, like something out of a movie. I broke down crying and immediately put the gun up and just grabbed my dog and sat on the ground. Now I can't say I won't feel my depression eat at me anymore but she made me realize in that moment that I wouldn't just be ending my pain by doing that, but I'd be passing it to the people I love. And that scares me the most. I still haven't told her, I don't think I ever will, but she saved my life yesterday and she has no idea. It might've not had been a big deal to her sending that to me but it changed my world. Literally. If there's anyone reading this that is feeling suicidal, please try and remember that. There will always be someone out there that loves you, even if that person is a random internet stranger. Thanks for reading."
I learned that 78% of suicides are men and people who‚Äôve self harmed are 9 times more likely to commit suicide. I‚Äôm worried about myself,I really don‚Äôt know... title says it all. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll go completely under with no one there for me and lose control of myself
I haven't hurt myself since September,"I don't know who else to share this with. Very few people in my life even know about my propensity for self harm. I've been doing it for 6 years now starting when I was 18. Nothing major predominately on my legs and chest, at my lowest point I was doing it multiple times a week. It's been 3 months officially today since I last did it. It's the longer I've gone since I was 19 or 20. I feel some hope that maybe I'm finally getting better but like I said only 2 people in my life even know and both are reluctant to talk about it and I'm hesitant to talk about this with them because I don't think they would understand why I'm proud of myself for 3 months abstention. I know nobody will probably read this but God I wanted to share it. Sorry this is such a rambling mess."

"If you're struggling, take a couple of minutes to read this.","Hey there friends :)

I posted this on r/SuicideWatch but I figured maybe it belonged here too :) 

If you're here that means you're probably hurting a lot right now and I want to start of by saying that I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you're going through this, you don't deserve it and you're important to me. Every single one of you.

I'm also really sorry that I can't take your pain away. If I could, I would take it in a heartbeat, I don't even care that I would have to deal with it. You guys on here are my main priority. 

I've spent a lot of my time on here, messaging people to try to help and the things that you're dealing with are intense. I truly understand everything that you're feeling and it's all valid. You aren't 'weird' or 'wrong' , these feelings are very real and it's so so hard to be fighting with yourself all the time.

I want you all to know that if I could, I'd give you a big hug and let you know that you're worthy and important and that it's going to be okay, even though it feels like the complete opposite right now. 

As someone who has and still is struggling with suicidal thoughts and self harm, I understand it's hard to just 'not' have them. Self harm is as hard to quit as smoking or drinking, because it ""relieves"" pain for a short while, while building it up in the background that leads to it becoming an unhealthy addiction. 

I know how hard mental illness hits, and while seeing a doctor/therapist/psychologist is a great option, I know that it's hard to make that step. You might not be ready to talk. You might not be able to afford it. You might not be able to get to one by yourself. I understand. But talking about it is proven to help manage things. I can't solve your problems or take them away, however much I want to, but I can make sure you don't go through this alone. 

You can talk to me about anything whenever, no judgement on reddit or discord.

"I got a cat, and I feel so much better","So, recently I have been dealing with anxiety and depression, I have been feeling so lonely and worthless.
One day I woke up and went to cook some breakfast a cat came through my backyard door and started meowing and I decided to give some food to her, this routine repeated from time to time and suddenly I started buying food for her, and one night she brought little kitties, they were three, two black and whites and one little gray one.
I sexed them and found that they were two boys and one girl.
I started feeding them and found them a home eventually except for the gray one.
She started to be in heat and I decided to take her to my house, I gave her all her vaccines and medicine.
She has warm up and when she hears me cry she comes and meows while asking me to cuddle her. She has become a really important part of my life, even when I don't want to take care of myself I have to take care of her, play with her, pet her and go to the vet with her.
She has provide me with routine and love, I absolutely adore her, she is always up for cuddles and helps me to relax."

You can read it [**HERE.**](https://gr8fultherapist.com/2019/11/01/50-powerful-strategies-for-coping-with-anxiety-and-depression/) **These are strategies based on  my years of experience with clients as well as the input of other therapists who shared strategies that worked for them.**

It will take another 8 to 10 seconds to get your clothes off. Step in the warm shower.  

As the warm water hits you it feels **amazing.**

[Originally posted on r/Advice as ""Why am I such a pathetic loser and how do I fix it before it gets me killed?"" My request for advice was downvoted there and I'm worried no one will reply because of that. Also, this seems like a better place to voice these concerns anyway.]

I'm 26 years old. My problem is this. I'm a quitter with no willpower. I give up on everything before I've even had a chance to really try. I'm afraid of putting in effort, and if I'm *forced* to make an effort, I do quite well for awhile, and then freeze up at some point late into the process, panic, dig my feet into the ground, drop everything, and stubbornly persist in inaction until all my progress has been sabotaged. This attitude and approach toward everything I do has ruined my life.

Through elementary school and high school, I was eccentric and asocial, but brilliant. My performance was excellent, far above the curve, right up to the end. Then, in the middle of 12th grade, I stopped trying. I didn't mean to stop trying. It was more like I couldn't try anymore even if I tried to try. Like my try engine was busted. My performance declined immediately, and it was only because I'd done so well up to that point that I still managed to graduate with excellent grades.

My performance up to that point got me a few merit scholarships, none of them in the area. One was for a school in Pennsylvania. I'm from the bay area in northern California, and my single mother was poor and we wanted to save money by any means possible, so I moved to Pennsylvania to go to college. This was perhaps too bold of me. Because I was used to succeeding, I was spoiled and believed I could do anything effortlessly. I believed I wouldn't have any transition pains. Friends, don't be smart, it makes you stupid.

I did well for one year, but I was miserable. Then I did pretty badly for most of another year because I froze up again and refused to make an effort. I felt like the world around me wasn't real, like every person and every building was made of cardboard and nothing I could do would have any consequence, so I just stayed in my dorm room all day every day. I wound up having to withdraw to avoid having it on my record that I'd flunked out, so I moved back to California to be with my mom again.

My credits from Pennsylvania couldn't be considered, so I had to go to community college for another, well, two years, I think? Then, with my grades already ruined and age having made me less attractive a prospect, we bit the bullet and sent me to a local university without a scholarship as a transfer student, with money we didn't really have per se.

I did kind of well for a year, and then started resisting my own progress again and having mental breakdowns. My second year, I wound up having to withdraw because I refused to make an effort any longer. I then repeated my second year and finished it. The year after that, my mother passed away unexpectedly and I had to withdraw again (though, for once, it's understandable).

It's been 2 years since then, and everything since then has just blurred together and left me confused, but I think what happened was something like this: I came back to try again when I felt I was ready, I was wrong and wasn't ready so I had to withdraw again, I came back again, and (very recently) after fighting a losing battle to stay afloat, I just completely gave up and decided I'm fundamentally not good enough for this. I withdrew permanently, on the very year I was meant to finally graduate.

I'm morbidly obese. While I was at the university back at home in California, I lost 130 pounds. I thought I could keep it up and achieve an acceptable weight. Since my mom died, I've gained it all back.

Also, through all this school BS, I've never learned to drive, never gotten a job or even tried applying for one, and until three months ago, I never even lived on my own. Now I'm renting a place with the money my mother's life insurance company paid out to me as her designated beneficiary. It's quite a significant chunk of money, so I'm fortunate enough to have some time to figure out how to be the adult I'm long overdue to be. But my time isn't unlimited.

I was also very dependent on her. Right up to when I was around 21 or so, she still bought me most of what I owned, still cleaned up after me and did my laundry, still drove me around, still arranged most of my meetings and kept track of the rest for me, still talked to people on my behalf because I didn't have the guts. I've since learned to do most of these things on my own, but even as I type this, there are around 15 bags of garbage in my studio apartment not taken out. I usually take out the garbage like any sane person, but for the past several weeks, I've been ""forgetting."" I also don't brush my teeth and hardly ever get haircuts. I'm basically barely capable of caring for myself.

Also I don't have any friends. Well, it's more like I refuse to have any. I show people a good personality, and they like me, and try to be my friends, but I freeze up and shut them out. I don't want them in my life. I don't want to hurt them by inevitably not being there when they need me, and I don't want to get hurt, either. Even a disgusting slob like myself could get laid if I wanted to, people have even made advances on me maybe two or three times in my life, but I refuse connections like that, too. If anyone tries to get close to me sexually, that's an even bigger red flag to me than if they try to be my friend. I go into panic. I've literally physically fled sobbing from a situation like that once before.

Please don't judge me too harshly for this, but because of my refusal to be with others or be vulnerable, I'm so touch-starved that I actually bought a love doll. Worst decision of my life. I don't know what to do with it now. I have nowhere to put it, and having it in my studio apartment, just existing, staring at me, judging me, makes me feel really horrible. I am going to have to order a hacksaw off Amazon, take the doll apart, and discreetly throw it out with the trash.

Like I said, I have a financial buffer to figure things out, but my time isn't unlimited. I don't believe I'm capable of holding down a job. I couldn't even hold down school. My mental problems are just too frequent for me to function in society, and I don't even have any aspirations left that I actually still believe in or appreciate. But at the same time, that kind of attitude, where I'm willing to say I'm not good enough for a job without even ever having tried to work one, is exactly what I'm talking about when I say I'm a quitter and too afraid of making an effort at anything.

Once my lease ends, I'm seriously considering either disposing of most of my belongings and entering into voluntary homelessness, or moving out of state again in search of a less competitive housing market, one where I could work a job simple and solitary enough for someone like me to handle, like carrying boxes around, and still make enough money to afford rent. Or both: disposing of most of my belongings, moving out of state to somewhere where it's safer to be homeless and no one I know can judge me, and dipping under the radar and into the urban wilderness.

Speaking of safety, that's where ""before it gets me killed"" comes in. The only thing keeping me from diving headlong into homelessness is that I don't want it to get me killed. Well, the same could probably be said for most people, right? Who would spend hours of every day making someone else richer if they didn't have to do it to survive? But if I don't become a better person soon, I won't have a choice. I'll wind up homeless, voluntary or otherwise, and if I'm not prepared for that, it very well might kill me. Also, my obesity might kill me if I don't slim down.

I know what I have to do. I've known that much for my whole life. I know most of the pure pragmatic *how* as well. What I don't know is how to find the strength.

I don't remember ever not being miserable. I remember this time when I was 9 years old and kept wailing in a grocery store and pulling on my mom's arm. Did we pass by a snack or toy I wanted? No. Hardly. I'd just felt a surge of emotion come over me for no particular reason I could discern, and I was literally begging her to end my life because I was too afraid to try it myself. I was hanging off her arm and wailing out ""kill me"" in the middle of the store. I don't know why I've been so unhappy for my whole life, but I guess my senior year in high school was just when it all culminated and I couldn't put up with it any longer, and I haven't really been able to ever since.

Therapy seemed to help a lot, but needing therapy so badly you can't even get it together to actually leave your house to go get it can be quite a predicament.

How do I fight this?

Am I just not good enough to live?"
Apologies for being remiss,"When I started this subreddit years ago, I was in a dark place. I felt alone and afraid and unwelcome most anywhere I went. I truly started it as a haven where I knew I would be accepted as it was a place of my own creation. However, since then, much has happened and I've grown a lot, learned a lot, and healed a lot. In that time, however, I also forgot many things- one being this subreddit. I found this once again by accident this evening and am honestly shocked and amazed at how it's grown. While I'm saddened to see so many people suffering from the horrible affliction that is mental illness, I'm also delighted to see so much support and banding together in such a tough situation. I also, however, see the need for an active moderator on a subreddit which hosts some of the most vulnerable going through the most difficult situations. For my absence, I am sorry. While I cannot say I will return and be that moderator (as I neither have the time and it would be detrimental to my own mental health), I can tell you I will work to find the appropriate replacement who will both reinvigorate this subreddit and act as a shield to potentially harmful content and information. It is truly a pleasure to be in the presence of so much love and support. Please continue your efforts, and may you all heal quickly. Thank you for trusting me and this subreddit as somewhere you can call home when there's nowhere else. "
Just wanted to say I‚Äôm in a much better place now. Thank you guys for supporting and lifting up everyone in this community.,"You are all truly great people. If I can feel better, everyone can. I‚Äôve been doing the opposite of what I normally do everyday and I finally feel free."
Does anybody else have physical pain and discomfort when they're really depressed?,I've asked this to some people and most of the time they dont get or seem confused. But for me when I'm really doing poorly I physically hurt all over especially in my joints; and I feel general discomfort all over like my skin is too tight or is sore somehow. Does anybody else experience this at all?
Read this if you're feeling down.,"Hi!

As a sufferer of depression, I know how tricky it can be. Sometimes it comes in waves, sometimes it's just hanging above your head everywhere you go, like a black cloud. Some days you wake up feeling kinda hopeful just to barely make it home alive in the afternoon, begging for every car to hit you, begging for your train to derail so you can get the fuck out of it all. Some days I'm like that.
But now I have a moment of clarity and I wanna share it with you.

You are worthy of life. Your life is not a waste. You always have something to be grateful for. A roof above your head, a handful of people that care about you, a lovely pet, some good books, good music, great movies... Maybe your hair is awesome all the time. Believe me, you're amazing in a few ways. Turning our lives from a curse into a gift is always within our reach. Just use your calm and clean moments to create reminders of this mindset. Post-it notes, reminders on your phone, a tattoo, whatever it takes. You can do it. If you need help, reach out for it. It's not weakness. It's actually quite the opposite. You're strong as hell for admitting that you have a problem, that you wanna change it and that you need some help with that. Believe me, it'll be better.

Don't give in to false ideals, like happiness and over-romanticized love. Happiness is not a constant state. True happiness is being content with who you are. Stop looking for 'the One'. There's no such thing. There are only potentially good partners you can form something beautiful and worthwhile with, if you're both willing to work on it and be emotionally aware. Stop trying so hard to be perfect. You won't be. None of us is. But we're all unique and we can always strive to be better. Do it for you. Let the fuel be self-love. The world is full of wonder. 

You've pushed through another day and for some people that's extremely hard. The people around you might not understand what you're going through. But I do and I'm proud of you!

Stay strong! :)"
Happy Valentines Day for all of those in struggle or are lonely.,"Even though I have never had a girlfriend (mostly because how fucking weird/strange I am), I wanted to share the love this year. 

For all of those who are in the struggle together, or are very lonely, I wish you a happy Valentines Day, and I wish the best of all of you guys. May you find true love.

I always try to remind myself that nothing is certain, everything can and will change (for better or worse), which means appreciate the moment for what you have, and don't lose hope for what you want or need."
Last week I wanted to jump off a bridge. Today I think WTF was I thinking?,Remember when you're feeling suicidal with depression to think of it as having the flu. Take time off ....then remember to be compassionate with yourself. After that strangle the imaginary parrot on your shoulder who's putting you down 24/7. The main thing? Give yourself an extra week or few days before you think of doing anything drastic.
"I‚Äôve lived 5-6 years longer than I ever thought I would, here‚Äôs my messed up story","I made this post because it breaks my heart reading so many people who want to die, so here‚Äôs my story and how I am now. I also posted this to suicidewatch but for some reason it was taken down by the mods, but that isn‚Äôt gonna stop me from sharing it. 

I began self harming at 13 and I would cut myself every damn day for years. When I was 14 I got so fed up with the world and who I was that I started taking pills for relief. One day I swallowed as many as I physically could (think it was 100mg each) and closed my eyes to rest. Woke up throwing up and feeling so disgustingly sick and this sick lasted for weeks. I couldn‚Äôt eat proper food and I couldn‚Äôt hold too many liquids either. My liver was so fucked up for long. I couldn‚Äôt even take one pill anymore without so much physical pain. 

I remember the day I tried to end it by cutting open my arms. It was a cool fall day, probably mid September or October. Nothing bad happened that day, I just was so fucking sick of it all. I grabbed the razor I usually cut myself with and just went as hard as I physically could down and all over my wrists. Holy shit the blood was terrifying. As soon as I saw the blood I immediately covered both of my arms up and did my best to stop the bleeding. The cuts actually weren‚Äôt that deep and I didn‚Äôt hit any veins so I was sure I‚Äôd be okay and just move on with my life. The scars were pink and very visible for years, and by that I mean everyone could look at them and see what I did till around my 18th birthday. In March of 2018 they were basically white and no longer really puffy so I decided that I would cover the one on my left wrist with a tattoo. That healed me emotionally so god dam much. 

I have a rose on my left wrist and the stem covers the scar so well that you can‚Äôt even see it anymore. It just looks normal. After I got the tattoo I realized how free I felt; my past really was gone for good and I could move on. This year (literally on my 19th birthday) I got another one but it covers the deep purple scars I had on my upper arm. It‚Äôs a floral band wrapping around my upper arm completely and oh fuck did it hurt to get done. But I shit you not, I almost cried after getting it because I felt... it‚Äôs indescribable. As for my body after the pill addiction and pill OD.. that‚Äôs a different story.

I have IBS now because I permanently fucked up my intestines that badly. Nobody in my family knows this is why I probably have it but that‚Äôs what a private meeting with my doctor concluded. My liver is healed and I can actually take 2 250mg pills for a headache, but that‚Äôs all I can handle without pain. 

I have a great job, amazing support system, amazing boyfriend, and even though life can be tough, I always remember I‚Äôm tougher. I survived two serious attempts and here I am at 19 having the time of my life. Five years ago I didn‚Äôt even think recovery was possible and now I haven‚Äôt cut myself in probably 9 months (it fuckin sucks kicking that habit), I graduated high school (NEVER planned on that), I have a great job that pays $17 an hour (and that‚Äôs just the minimum for my trade, I‚Äôm gonna keep going up) and life is just so great in general. Recovery is possible and it‚Äôll take years, I‚Äôm still getting better and trying to move on from it all, but it is worth it.

For those who read the entire thing,yay! Thank you so much. I‚Äôll be making a post soon about how I got through all of this I promise!"
Coping method that works for me,"You know how sometimes you literally can't control your thoughts and it spirals out of control and all of a sudden you're thinking about how that one time when you messed up makes you want to crash you car into a tree in the hopes it'll kill you?

Well I've sort found a good way of coping with that. It is very simple. Just say out loud to yourself: ""I don't want to be thinking about this right now. Let's think about something else.""
At this point in my recovery I'm able to just think it in my head when I detect some toxic thoughts and move on. But starting out it was quite hard. I would say this sentence in different variations depending on where I was and what I was doing. 
When I was driving I would say ""Hey, let's not think about this in a car."" Or I would district myself with a ""I wonder what's on the radio. What stations are good? I hope 105.3 the shark isn't just playing commercials right now. Or maybe I should listen to pop music.""
If I was walking down town it would be ""I should go to the library"" Or ""I wonder that store sign is still up even though it's been closed for years now."" 
Basically say out loud to yourself anything that isn't what you are currently thinking that is neutral in emotion. You don't want to go straight from toxic depression to toxic positivity. Take a neutral stance on your state of mind and surroundings and comment on that. Overtime it can become a good habit that can stop panic attacks before they happen."
Not suicidal but not interested in being alive.,"I have come out of a long term depression and coping with my life healthily. 

Although, I am still not interested in being alive. FYI, I am not feeling helplessly suicidal but feel tired about being alive. I find life boring and pointless. These thoughts dont even come on purpose, they just are there.

Any help to not have this mindset would be appreciated."
"I'm just tired of ""improving"" myself","Everyday I wake up, take a morning walk, do some exercises, work out, try eating healthily, talk to internet strangers, make friends here and there and so on and so forth. What's the point of all that. I'm not happy at all, despite everyone saying that working on myself will make me feel some sort of accomplishment. I don't. Yes, I guess I'm more healthy than ever before. But that's not what I'm after. That's not my passion or anything.

I like doing various alone-things like playing video games or daydreaming because I'm an introvert. But I'm also lonely. I could go out and meet some people. But I'd have to force myself out there, put on some fake happy face and make friendships that won't hold because either A. I would have to maintain a false personality, forget that I'm an introvert and just go out there every fucking time someone wants to meet up and do something I will not enjoy or B. go on about my introverted life but in return people will just abandon me, as they tend to do because there's a lack of common interests in the end.

The only real friends who genuinely get me are internet friends sitting somewhere on the other edge of the world. But those friends hit so much different than local friends. And, honestly, I think I'm even perfectly fine with my current friends situation. I just want someone to tell ""I love you"" to and the typical relationship stuff, but it's kinda hard finding someone compatible if I prefer staying home and cutting myself off of people. Dating apps? Fuck that, no luck there either. I understand you don't ""need"" that to survive and I could probably find some other purpose in life but this certain void in my heart will never be filled. And I can't just forget about it either.

Thank you for reading this. Apparently venting a bit to internet strangers helps for an hour or two, so there's that."
"FK it, im gonna change my life","Had enough of being depressed and having suicidal fantasies and thoughts, im tired of being fat. Im going to change my life, get fit mentally and physically. Fuck depression. We can do this all people. We all can try."
Is anyone else having major depressive feelings & anxiety about all that‚Äôs going on right now?,"My routine is completely fucked. No school, no work, no friends, no gym. I‚Äôm terrified for the next couple of weeks because I don‚Äôt want to (and quite frankly, can‚Äôt) live like this. Is anyone else having these same fears/anxieties?"
"I don‚Äôt want to die, but I don‚Äôt want to exist","My depression has been really getting to me lately. I feel apathetic about life. I have moments of contentment, but most of the time, I just don‚Äôt care. Nothing matters. I just want to sleep all day.

I‚Äôm sure my job at the thrift store isn‚Äôt really helping any. My manager has created so many rules and regulations that I never want to go in anymore, but I have no other job to fall back on. No sitting down on the clock, don‚Äôt talk to your coworkers for more than a few seconds (even if it‚Äôs about work), bathroom breaks need to be taken on our breaks or you need to be out within five minutes, you have to get a doctor‚Äôs note even if you just have a common cold... If you get off work early, you can‚Äôt come back in and shop, you can only shop on your days off. I‚Äôm trying to remember them all, but it‚Äôs nearly 11pm, and I‚Äôm tired, so please forgive me not listing all of them. I‚Äôm not even sure I know all of them, since they change from day to day. 

But I still feel sort of guilty. I have a job. I should be thankful, even though I often wish to just run away. I have a home, I don‚Äôt have to pay rent since I live with my grandparents... but living with them, and all their cats, and my nana‚Äôs nephew that has an intellectual disability that calls me fat, lazy, useless, etc., it doesn‚Äôt feel much better. I would like to just appreciate what I have, like people tell me to all the time... but instead I just feel sad. 

And I don‚Äôt feel like I can really tell these things to people. I fear burdening my boyfriend, I fear my therapist putting me in the psych ward, and I stupidly let it slip how miserable I‚Äôve been lately to my psychiatrist, who has upped my dosage and also insists I speak with case management and move out. Which that‚Äôd be great, only I‚Äôm too depressed to take care of myself half the time, and despite the huge amount of stress my job causes me, it doesn‚Äôt pay enough for me to survive on. Not even the minimum level of survival. 

Is there no way to feel joy in life anymore? Is there no way to end this perpetual cycle of being tired and stressed all the time? Have I just rambled on nonsensically? I just want to *want* to exist, at least, instead of thinking, *‚ÄùI‚Äôd have no qualms with dying today. Not waking up would be fine. If some entity just snapped their fingers and i was erased from time and space, that‚Äôd be swell.‚Äù* 

On a side note, I intend to be up a little while longer, but I may fall asleep. Some nights I can‚Äôt sleep until 2am, others I can‚Äôt even make it past 9pm, but I never want to get up. I only do because I know if I don‚Äôt, no one is going to help me when everything starts falling apart a month from now."
A short(ish) guide on showering,"  A short(ish) guide on showering. I have marked this post as not safe for work because I talk about my ass a lot. Thanks to everyone who takes the time to read.

Ah yes, personal hygiene, the bane and all consuming nightmare for anyone who cannot bring themselves out of bed. We as people try to bribe ourselves, if you get up and have a shower then you will feel better, but that bed is so comfortable, and its not like you‚Äôre going anywhere, why should you have to shower? The biggest reason I can think of is because its very very very simple. 

Because it makes YOU feel better.

We still get up to pee, what‚Äôs so hard about having a shower? Well when I say ""everything"" people usually laugh. The idea of taking off the pyjamas you haven‚Äôt washed or changed in give or take a week is like peeling back the layers of your failure onion, looking at your matted crusty greasy hair is like looking straight into your birdnest of shame. Trying to even attempt to trim the hair on your face, or armpits, or where have you feels like you‚Äôre battling a particularly stinky yeti that tells you that you suck. Noticing you still have mascara goop in your eye from that one day you put in effort is like a glaring unhygienic reminder of how completely worthless you feel. You feel vulnerable, naked, figuratively and literally. 

And then there‚Äôs the smell, as someone who has gone for weeks without showering I can tell you that the human body is not a garden, it‚Äôs a waste disposal centre of epic proportions. You smell from everywhere, and your butt cheeks feel like they‚Äôre kind of glued to each other. And when you finally get to that point where you are ready to turn on the shower and you step under, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre a snake, shedding your own skin. And the water washing off you is definitely not the right colour. So why the gruesome picture you may ask? Because it‚Äôs a reality for so many people, and it perfectly illustrates why depression isn‚Äôt a simple quick fix, it‚Äôs a years long battle. The idea of your ass smelling and your sheets having a skin imprint on them is so completely unpleasant, even to me as someone who has been there. it perfectly illustrates just how strong the hold is on people who are fundamentally good people. How strong the shackles on our minds can be. 

So what about this guide, you‚Äôve personally illustrated very well what its like to not shower, how can I get to showering? The answer is hard to do in the real world but its so simple to write down: do the minimal effort and get the maximal pay off. You start small, ridiculously small. Pick a body part, even if its washing your hands after you pee instead of walking to your fridge and then crashing back into bed. If that‚Äôs too much then trim your finger nails, hell, trim one finger nail,. Every single goddamn day. When that doesn‚Äôt feel like a gargantuan task of epic proportions that makes you want to cry at the thought of it, then add a finger nail, or fuck, do one and a half if two feels too much. I started, by washing my genitals. For smell related reasons, obviously. I didn‚Äôt shave, I didn‚Äôt do anything fancy, just some ph neutral soap and a bidet, that‚Äôs all, the main reason I did this was because I went to the bathroom every day and that involved putting my pants down, it seemed like an easy place to start. And I did it, for about a week, and then I stopped doing it for a day and it made me cry because look at you, you layered dirty onion of shame and disgust why cant you even wash your own ass, what are you? A fucking baby, cant even do that one fucking thing, you piece of shit. 

That‚Äôs what happens, and I‚Äôm sure it might happen to you, and you‚Äôll crash into bed and resume whatever you were mindlessly watching as you hope your over rested, creaky, aching body will just fall asleep again even though you slept for 16 hours. It will happen, and my advice is:

Tell yourself to that what you didnt do is okay. Dont excuse yourself, but realise that failure is not a curse word, its a reality of life. That‚Äôs how depression is combatted and it is a fight, but instead of you murdering the crazy 88s like the badass you are, you‚Äôre in a room with yourself, no lucy liu, no gogo. Just you and your head. And instead of a hanzo sword you have to fight your own brain that is biologically programmed to tell you you‚Äôre a piece of shit. And its hard, its hard to fight that voice in your head. But you know what wasnt hard for me? washing my ass, I made it as easy as i could for myself, and after that one time i kept doing it, because i told myself that it was okay to fail, to strive to be better.

I know the follow up is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so depressed I don‚Äôt even care if I smell, I don‚Äôt care if people see me like this, I don‚Äôt care if I die from ass stank induced shock‚Äù. I‚Äôve been there myself. And these depression guides seem to gloss over the fact that even the simple act of caring can seem like an impossibility. Here‚Äôs what I found out: caring as a depressed person isn‚Äôt there, it has to be created. A lot of the times people will ask a depressed individual to choose something they care about and then ‚Äúdo it for them‚Äù comes out. But it doesn‚Äôt work like that. You have to do it, and the caring will come later. You have to in a sense rewire your brain. I don‚Äôt wash my ass because I love my parents and don‚Äôt want them to be disappointed. I wash my ass because I like my ass to be clean, and smell decent, I didn‚Äôt care what it smelled like when I started, but I started caring because when I went to pee, I wasn‚Äôt greeted by a horrible smell and a constant reminder of my failure as a human being, because hey you know what brain, its okay, I cleaned my ass, and even though I did nothing else, I still cleaned my ass and that‚Äôs more than I did before. And I can say I am proud of it.

Consider for a moment that your brain, or rather the imbalance within them are trying to make you do all these things you don‚Äôt really like, and on top of that this imbalance is also making you not care about the inability of doing these things. That‚Äôs the part you have to say fuck you to.

Wash your ass, start with something small (or in my case big, get it, I‚Äôm saying my ass is big haha, I‚Äôm so funny). And the caring will come, and after the ass, you can move on to washing your hair, or brushing your teeth, or even just trimming a fingernail, or drinking one single cup of water, the caring will come later. And when you do wash your ass, be nice to yourself. 

Here I will help you, for when you have done the one hygienic thing:

An achievement to ‚Ä¶.:

Hereby I wish to say that ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Partook in an act of personal hygiene, an achievement that should not be overlooked, a wondrous day for mankind. She or he took the time to perform this task, even though it probably sucked and no one is more proud of her or him than I. It is with great pride and pleasure that I say that this act of personal hygiene is something we collectively, as a society should be proud of and no one should be more proud than the person reading this, who took the time to perform this task.

That probably came off as sarcastic and petulant, but the message is there, Don‚Äôt punish yourself for doing something, that in my experience is the best way to break your cycle. Because its so easy to go ‚Äúyeah you did one thing, but look at all these other things you suck at, look at this bed, look at this house, why is the pizza box moving, because of you, asshole‚Äù. You have to stop it. I‚Äôm not saying you need to build a parade every time you wash your hair, but you also shouldn‚Äôt be tearing yourself down for it, you did something that feels so big and so difficult that you cant do it every day, and that is an achievement.

Take the time to feel pride for your smallest accomplishments, allow yourself to feel okay about something. And even if you cant bring yourself to say good job to you, be neutral. Its okay to just say okay and try again. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, it was way more ass talk than I intended and isnt exactly short, but I hope it got my point across. I hope you have an okay day."
"To all my friends and fellow fighters, if you're considering suicide please just hear my message, please.","Wait buddy I know it feels like there is no way out of this, but the way you're feeling right now will change if you give it some or  months of time.

"When the rain comes, it rains, but it doesn't stay.","Jim Carrey told inews, ‚ÄúAt this point, I don‚Äôt have depression. There is not an experience of depression. I had that for years, but now, when the rain comes, it rains, but it doesn‚Äôt stay. It doesn‚Äôt stay long enough to immerse me and drown me anymore.‚Äù

People with depression¬†have a hard time separating their thoughts from reality; they can often fall victim to black and white thinking. This means that they view everything as all good or all bad, and can‚Äôt see any grey area. However, if you detach yourself from your ego and simply view all of life as an experience, it can help you move through your journey on Earth in a more fluid way."
I have the desire to be around people but absolutely zero motivation to attempt it and I feel like it makes me look desperate and awkward,"interacting with people or even going out of my way to talk to them just feels completely forced, I'm totally fine with being alone when I am alone (in fact, I generally prefer it that way) but when I'm around people I feel like I have to make some effort to socialize but it feels like a total chore to do it and I always feel like I'm trying too hard, I don't hate people, I enjoy making friends and getting to know them, I just don't know how to interact with them and prefer being alone to feeling like I'm getting in people's way"
Being Positive Is The Dumbest Advice Ever,"When you're depressed and on a bad luck streak, positive thinking makes things worse because it DOES NOT HELP AT ALL. In fact, it makes you more depressed because it just leads to more disappointment. 

The reality is negative or positive thinking isn't going to change any situation that has outside influences such as being in financial distress, jobless, homeless, or a bad relationship. You're purely dependent on the mercy of others. 

If you're depressed, don't waste time on positive thinking, words of affirmation, and all the other bs people try to suggest. It only makes you depressed. Just work hard, have no expectations and maybe the law of averages may swing your way at some point, just don't expect miracles or when you need it most.  

I know a lot of people don't want to hear this but it's the truth. Don't make yourself more depressed by lying to yourself and living in a false reality."

My girlfriend is struggling horribly and wants to kill herself.,"I (20M) am beyond confused as to how I can help my girlfriend (20F) get out of this rut. Her and I are very close and we can talk about anything at all. 

Today she had a huge anxiety attack at school and when I brought her back to her house she was hysterical- she was screaming and crying and would not stop for an hour or so no matter what I did. I feel like I‚Äôm an extremely supportive boyfriend to her and I know that I treat her right and help her all the time. 

She told some that she wishes she was dead and that she genuinely is wanting to take her pills and kill herself today. She‚Äôs attempted it before, but it‚Äôs been 2 years since she did. I took her pills away from her so she couldn‚Äôt and now she‚Äôs asleep on her bed and I‚Äôm here in the dark looking up ways to help her even more than I have been. She‚Äôs been down like this for about a month and is falling behind in all of her classes, her work, and she hates her body. 

I was supposed to be at work 2 1/2 hours ago but said I‚Äôd be late because I had to stay home for a little. I‚Äôm afraid to leave her alone because she gets very frantic when she‚Äôs like this, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do as I‚Äôm a personal care giver to blind and dead individuals who need me to be there ASAP (nobody can cover my shift). 

HOW DO I HELP HER. I‚Äôve never been in her position and I need to know how I can help her throughout the day rather than just when she needs me."
You have worked so hard to pick yourself up and I am right there with you,"I always feel like no one takes time to appreciate how difficult it is for us to do all the things we are doing. We woke up yesterday. We might have gone out to get groceries. We might have talked to an acquaintance at work. We might have washed the dishes. Maybe we took our dog for a walk. It sometimes sucks to think that these 'simple' things that are negligible to most are humongous obstacles to us, but I want to take the time to say that I know it's hard and I couldn't be more proud of where you are right now. Even if it's in the worst moment of your life, it's been such a long and hard journey to get here. I cannot express my pride for us all and I can't wait for what we can accomplish once this is all over."
Does anyone else feel like they deserve to feel depression and feel shitty all the time?,"I'm just curious if this is a normal feeling. I might have options to get out of my depression, like certain pills, maybe PMS pills (antidepressants seem to never work but my depression gets 10 times worse around my period) and maybe counseling would work. Maybe these things would work if I tried them again even if they haven't in the past, but for two reasons I haven't(besides cost). First I don't think they'd work or the side effects to meds wouldn't be worth it. But second and perhaps more important idk that I want to get better, I feel like I should live with all the shitty feelings and guilt, like I have to or deserve to. I don't do it for attention, maybe once in my life when I was much more lost, when all this depression started to get bad, but not anymore, I barely even talk about my depression to anyone anymore. Is this normal? Or common? To feel like you deserve misery? Or am I actually just being an attention whore throwing a pity party for herself or something stupid like that? I don't want to be that."
"My girlfriend is suffering from depression, and I‚Äôm looking for some advice on how I can be more supportive.","For some context, we‚Äôve been together for almost three years and a large portion of our relationship has been long distance. She‚Äôs been suffering from depression for most of her adult life and it‚Äôs been especially bad in recent weeks. She‚Äôs a recent college grad and is really stressed out about her future, and whether or not she‚Äôs making correct decisions for her career. This causes her to feel anxiety, which in turn causes her depression to worsen and this cycle repeats. I know that I can‚Äôt cure her depression, but I want to do all I can to be supportive while she figures out how best to deal with it. Recently she‚Äôs been saying she doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs fair for me to have to deal with her when she‚Äôs like this, and she‚Äôs worried that‚Äôs it‚Äôs having a negative impact on our relationship. I‚Äôve never really had to deal with depression as closely as I am now, and am looking for ways to improve, or even just some advice on things to do to help. I always try to be supportive, letting her know that I‚Äôm here for her and that I love her. It‚Äôs been increasingly difficult for me as she often becomes withdrawn, and with the distance and our differing work schedules most of our communication is through texting. Sorry if this post has been a little lengthy, I haven‚Äôt had the chance to talk to anyone other than her about it. I appreciate any advice you guys can share."

An algorithm to help people with depression,"UPDATE: *I have the 50 responses I wanted for this first week! I can't believe how fast I got them. I am humbled and thankful for the Redditt community! I love this place already. Thank you. I am so happy that I'll keep collecting info until I get to 100. Then I'll see if I'm overwhelmed with work, lol. Please follow me! I want to keep doing stuff like this for the community! THIS IS SO MEANINGFUL TO ME. YOU HAVE NO IDEA.*   


Hey There!  :)

I built an algorithm to help people with mental health. It is pretty cool.

I am an anonymous therapist that is tech savvy. I built an algorithm to analyze peoples needs and then compare it to the progress of other people with the same profile. Then it generates meaningful tips that emails people free advice based on what helped other similar people.

The recommendations from my algorithm have been helpful to me and to others. So I run it for other people for free (it's a strange hobby I know, but I like to do it). I have to put the data in manually, so I use google forms to collect your info and I enter it manually later. You can fill it out totally anonymously.

Fill out this google form and I will enter your data and email a list of 7 online resources that may help you. I can do more, but it is a bit of work. lol

Each response is personalized just for you! Know that this isn't a generic test. You'll get personalized resources that helped people who have a similar profile as you.

I only do 50 of these emails per week. So fill this out at the beginning of the week to maximize your chances of getting recommendations.

I hope this helps! Let me know if it does! I love feedback.

I wish I wasn‚Äôt so worried all the time. I wish I was actually brave for once. I wish I didn‚Äôt always think about what others think about me. I wish I could let go of the past. But I can‚Äôt.,"For the longest time, I‚Äôve had this dream that I‚Äôll be a musician. Singing songs and making people happy. Making myself happy. I‚Äôve wrote songs before, I‚Äôve played many instruments before, I‚Äôve spent hours playing around secretly in GarageBand. I took singing lessons for a while. In the 4th grade I was in the 5th grade music class, because apparently I was ahead of my classmates. I played piano, and took up drums for a while. 

I quit singing lessons last year. The violin is gone now. And every once in a while on some stupid magical moment, I play piano. But I still long for music.


Even with drawing, which I put my heart and soul into, I still long for music.


Even when sewing, I sing. 


Even when I‚Äôm outside, I sing and sing and cry. Because I‚Äôm so weak.

I‚Äôm weak because I couldn‚Äôt sing in front of others. I‚Äôm weak because I‚Äôm so shy. I‚Äôm weak because I couldn‚Äôt even sing properly with my singing teacher. I never let go.


I‚Äôm so mad at myself. I want to let this dream go, but I don‚Äôt at the same time. Isn‚Äôt it enough for me? Art, drawing, and sewing? Why do I still cling to music? I can‚Äôt sing. I sound horrible when I‚Äôm standing in front of people. My legs shake and I cry. I can‚Äôt even sing outside anymore, because I‚Äôm afraid of neighbors hearing. I can only sing with headphones on because even I judge myself. I‚Äôm my worst enemy. 



Why do I STILL want to sing? Why do I still find myself singing when I can? Why can‚Äôt I just let this stupid dream go? This stupid worthless dream. I‚Äôm going to art school to draw, which I‚Äôm still bad at. I‚Äôm not going for music. 


I want to let go of song. But I don‚Äôt at the same time. I‚Äôm stuck yet again. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm here.


I just needed to vent."

I don‚Äôt know what to say. I am so embarrassed. Has anyone else done anything like this? I would feel better just knowing other people have gone through it and how they handled it. Thanks guys."

If you're glued to your bed right now...,"Take a second. Breathe in, breathe out. Remind yourself that being idle will not solve any of your problems. 

Do your best to get up out of bed. Stretch your legs, touch your toes, bend and twist and work out the kinks in your muscles and hear your joints crack as they come alive. 

Brush your teeth, take a shower, and put on some nice clothes. Pick out your favourite outfit and wear it out for a walk. Wear it to school, wear it to work, wear it to the grocery store. 

Get fresh and try to focus on feeling pride in the fact that you, an individual, came up with this outfit. You got out of bed, brushed your teeth, took a shower, and came alive. 

It helps a little bit. It helped me today after I woke up and cried for about an hour. You guys should try to skip that step if you can, I don't recommend it. It can be therapeutic sometimes tho. 

Much love to y'all, good luck. "
I love anime so much it made me do things today,"Like, no one asked. I'm an absolutely horrible person and I don't think I even deserve to be alive, but anime... 

Today I felt kinda good. Sports anime are especially motivational for some reason. Seeing the characters so enthusiastic and motivated to achieve something, to keep fighting, laughing and smiling... it made me cry a lot. I felt comforted in some way, because they had failed a lot too. They weren't perfect and made mistakes, lots of them sometimes, but they were still standing up and were able to be happy.

So then I finally found the motivation to get up and have something to eat, shower, and I forced myself to smile. I started to cry again but it felt good.

I feel guilty for feeling good, but maybe if I'm ever able to overcome the past I can be happy too, just like those characters I see on anime. I guess I'll keep fighting. I don't want to be this horrible, it hurts a lot"
How can I lose weight when I can barely function?,"I will die alone unless I manage to fix my body soon. But I can't find the energy to exercise after or before work, which drains me physically and mentally. I don't know what to do. I just wish I could come up with the courage to end it already."
"""You don't need therapy every week, it's not like you were abused""","My mom can straight up go fuck herself. She's the most ignorant, narcissistic piece of scum I've ever known. All she cares about is how much money she'll have for herself for retirement than my declining mental health. No, I may not have been physically abused but I sure as fuck was mentally abused, and she's still abusing me to this day.

She doesn't wanna help pay for my therapy every week so fuck her, I'll pay for my own therapy with what little money I have until I go broke because at least I'll be on the road to getting better. Every time I've tried to have a calm conversation with her about my therapy she'll immediately start yelling and insulting me, and she'll make my depression out to be nothing more serious than just a little boo boo.

She's another classic case of a family member who doesn't understand how serious a person's mental health is until it's too late. If I killed myself, then she'd understand just how fucking serious my mental illness is. It makes me so mad knowing that that's the only way she'll get it. And even then she'll make it all about herself and say something like ""I wish I could've been there for her more"". She can go eat shit."
too ugly to go out in public,"do you ever feel like you‚Äôre too ugly to leave your house...well I feel that way every single day and that feeling never goes away. I‚Äôm soooo insecure to the point where I avoid looking people in the face let alone the eyes, I don‚Äôt even like conversing with my family for the same reasons especially since they‚Äôre really beautiful and confident and I envy that about them. I always make up excuses to not leave my house which makes my family surmise that I‚Äôm anti social and a loner but I‚Äôm really not. I wish I COULD do what normal people do but I CANT so it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like socializing it‚Äôs just that I physically and mentally can‚Äôt which sucks because then I have to say home all day everyday which leads to me feeling tired and lethargic the entirety of the day and not to mention morbidly bored. I‚Äôm just so sick of being like this. I wish I had a normal life.

EDIT: more context for those interested..

 I compare myself to others ALL THE TIME have it be to my mom,sister,cousins,friends, random people on the street or people on the internet and it kills me!! It all started when I was a kid (6-7) and my mom along with my sister used to tease me for my appearance which they deemed not pretty enough or not girly enough. Whenever my mom and I would get in a fight she would bring up all my insecurities and it made me feel like shit, she would also compare me to other girls (sister,cousin,friends...) and point out areas in which they are better than me and then she‚Äôd end it by saying that I will never find happiness and that no one will ever want to date/marry me which is now always in the back of my mind. Then we have my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù at school who did almost the same but they would say it in a way that it almost sounds like they were giving me advice or something. So they would say things along the lines of ‚Äúyou would‚Äôve been so pretty if only you didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúblank‚Äù ...etc which made me so aware of my insecurities hence how I feel today. Throughout my childhood and early teenage years I‚Äôve garnered comments about my appearance that can last me a lifetime and it always revolved around either my face or the way I dressed up. I‚Äôm 16 (sophomore) and during my first two years or high school I‚Äôve had people scorn me for my clothes being too old fashioned literally all the time, they would be hysterically laughing in my face to which I always laugh along pretending I wasn‚Äôt deeply hurt which I suspect what made them keep going with the ruthless jokes. Sorry, this is all over the place but I just kinda needed to let some of it out, it kinda helps. Btw this is but a fraction of what I had to put up with for almost 10 years my life (more than half my life.)"
Angry that I am always there for everyone else but they are no where to be found when I am in need.,"I've been unemployed for 5 months now, slowly losing my entire life savings. I'm old and tired of trying to start new with jobs. A few years ago I took a huge leap and got additional education in the hopes that it would equal a better salary and better mental health. My partner abused me for over a decade and when I finally left last year I couldn't keep my job because he was stalking me. Plus, the job was super stressful and I couldn't deal. Now, months later, I am stuck and every one I reach out to has let me down. I am trying to keep positive, but the rejection of job interviews and applying to hundreds of jobs has worn me down. I am pissed that my friends and family seem to have no empathy."
hard to be a man with a depression,"no one cares. no single one. gives fuck about you. especially after 25+. no single fucks given. you worth nothing. unworthy piece of shit. can't even suicide. stuck. wish to be dead instead. got defeated in all ways. thousand times. have no single hope. dreams start to become more real and pleasure if you don't have nightmares instead. hate everyone around you. hate life. slow death. nobody would ever care. everything is lie. fake support. fake therapy. agendas for money. screwing people up to the riches.

I started reading again,"For as long as I remember, I loved reading. Depression (and high school and college) took that away from me. I've recently started up again, after something like 5 years of no reading at all, except for school and internet. I've already reread one of my favorites (The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller! Great book, if you love mythology). I forgot how awesome it is to lose yourself in a book for hours and hours. I'm so fucking happy!! My advice to anyone who's like me: start small. For me, I said I'd read at least 2 pages a day, but you can do it with any amount! I've found that if you set a goal too big too soon you'll get intimidated and give up sooner. Good luck!!"
I am ready to move on.,I am proud of myself. I got emotional this morning because I finally decided to keep the past in the past and just move on from all the shitty things that have happened to me. I'm ready.

Tips to Cope with Depression: A Novice's Guide to Self Help,"For context I'm a 25F in a highly developed city on the west coast. I'm currently in a serious relationship but been single for long periods of time and dealt with failed relationships after years of commitment. I grew up in a conservative religious home with neither parents active in the household since the age of 8. I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 10-15 years give or take. Here is just a short list of tips and tricks that help me claw myself out of an unannounced spiraling depression episode. Obviously everyone is different but I hope this can help at least one person not sink further into the depression pit. It has taken me years of introspective thought and practicing different behaviors to the point where I think I recognize my triggers and I feel I have some sort of handle on it now to where I can cope. I hope everyone on here gets the help they need and realize that there is hope if you're willing to fight for yourself. I know this post is going to be unbearably long at some parts but I think it's important for me to explain what I do and why I do it so you can hopefully apply it to your lives.

1. **Keep a journal:** As trivial and silly as it sounds, keeping a journal to unleash all my uninhibited thoughts and feelings helped me immensely throughout my adolescence and adulthood. I had always been the person hesitant to confide in a non-professional (family, friend, coworker etc) to avoid judgement, unsolicited advice, fake sympathy and I feel a lot of people feel the same way. The first big step I took for my depression is writing down a 7 page account of events that I believe lead to a perpetual state of depression. Getting all that information out of my head gave me a huge sense of relief. I never knew I was holding onto so much weight and animosity toward a situation or a specific person until it fell out of me like an emotional waterfall.
2. **Cut out toxic relationships/friendships:** This was probably one of the hardest steps in my journey and one I heard on a constant basis from countless articles. It's a lot easier said than done but I can wholeheartedly say cutting out specific people in my life that brought nothing but a dissatisfaction has drastically improved my state of being. Sometimes it's hard to tell when someone needs to be cut out but I had to ask myself if I'm spending time with this person because I was lonely and bored, or if they genuinely brought me joy and fulfillment. That can be a hard distinction to make but for me it was a gut feeling once I actually thought about it deeper.
3. **Get a pet/plant:** I know this isn't a feasible option for everyone on here but having a furry friend gave me a ""purpose"" and a ""reason"" to get out of bed everyday. If I want to sleep in or pretend I don't exist my cats wont let me because they want to play, give me love and cuddles and I have to make sure their food and water is full. It forces me to get out of bed every morning whether I want to or not. I know dogs and cats may not be doable in every living situation but even something as small as a hamster or fish will force you to stick to a routine, distract you and bring you more joy. This also applies to a plant, which is a more practical option for a majority of people, especially if you don't have the kind of money to take care of an animal.
4. **Recognize your signs:** What I mean by that is recognize what behavior patterns you fall into that lead you to spiral into a depression episode. A common one for me (and a lot of other people on here) is not taking care of myself such as, oversleeping, not eating for days, not showering, not responding to loved ones for days, cancelling plans, calling sick into work etc. Once I recognized these sequence of behaviors were a result of me not keeping myself in check, I was able to counteract them with other behaviors, which has been one of the hardest things I've had to learn... Which leads me to #5.
5. **Changing toxic behavior:** Believe me, I know how easy it is to sink deeper and deeper into the pit. I'm sure for some of you (like for me) the pit is comfortable at this point and getting yourself sounds more scary and daunting than letting yourself go. Circling back to #3 I have found ways to *forcing* myself to do things besides lay in bed and pretending to not exist. I now set a routine for myself after work on Monday I meal prep for the entire rest of the week. One, it forces me to do something after work that's out in public (grocery shopping), two, it forces me to do something around the house besides laying around and three, over the years I've actually grown to have fun doing it. I throw on a funny TV show, watch YouTube, listen to audio books or listen to music. That's just one example of something practical and that most everyone can do to force yourself to stay productive. You will spend less money on food as well instead of eating out all the time, and I have a harder time justifying skipping 2-3 days of food to avoid my food from spoiling (I'm a penny pincher).
6. **Having something to look forward to:** A reoccurring theme to me is to keep busy and productive so I don't feel so stagnant and idle. For me I try to constantly have at least 1-3 things planned at any given month (preferably more than 1-3). Of course think of things that YOU are interested in but some examples of things I do are: concerts, local attractions in your area (my area has a zoo, small theme park, farmers markets), camping, conventions, trying now restaurants etc.
7. **Bad days will happen:** When all of this is said and done, I still have those bad days/weeks. It's just important to realize that they wont last forever, if you're willing to fight fucking hard for better days. It's okay to cry, it's okay to take a break and ""grieve"" so to speak. Circumstances and situations can definitely trigger bad days/weeks, but reverting back to #4 and #5 you need to recognize if it's just a bad day/week or something more.
8. **Self-love/Self-care:** If any of you are like me this is a tough one, especially if that little voice in your head tells you you're not good enough. After telling yourself that enough times over several years it's hard to convince yourself otherwise. I guess the most important part about this is baby steps so it eventually becomes second nature. Instead of just getting out of bed lifeless and putting on the first thing you see, pick out an outfit that gives you full confidence. Instead of running out the door without doing your hair or makeup, take that extra 10 minutes to build that confidence. Instead of coming straight home after work, treat yourself to a scenic drive or your favorite soft drink at the drive thru. Instead of comparing yourself to other's accomplishments, recognize your own and CELEBRATE them. There is NOTHING wrong with being happy with an accomplishment and celebrating it.
9. **Perspective:** My best friend struggles with insecurity, anxiety and comparing herself to others around her (as I do and have in the past) and hearing her accounts made me realize that what she was insecure and anxious about were things I had no idea about. I never focused on her physical appearance, I was always proud of her work ethic, her sense of humor, her tenacity etc. but all she saw was failure. It made me realize that the people that care most about you don't see those ""flaws"" that keep you up at night.

Another side of **Perspective:** This may not apply to everyone, but I'd say a majority of people were taught a certain standard of living to be deemed ""acceptable"". Whether that was by their parents, religious affiliation, school, social groups etc. With an ideal ingrained in your subconscious in your development years, it can be hard to shake even if you grow up and choose not to take that path. For example: Growing up in a large, religiously affiliated family I always believed that I would graduate high school, meet a husband and start a family together. Once I reached adolescence I realized that wasn't the choice I wanted to make with my life. For years I dealt with self-loathing and pain, thinking I wasn't choosing the right path even though staying with the faith isn't what I truly wanted. These pre-conceived ideas of success and happiness I was taught at such a young age wasn't success and happiness to me anymore, and that terrified me but I didn't even know it. I had to completely rearrange what happiness meant to me instead of relying on other people around me to define it on my behalf. I had to convince myself that my tattoos and piercings were okay. That drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis is okay in moderation and totally normal. After years of self loathing and self harm I convinced myself that being openly sexual with my partners is biologically normal and acceptable if done with the right intent and people. A lot of these revelations I learned through journaling.

I could write dozens of more things that have helped me throughout my 10-15 year journey. I can honestly say (fingers crossed) that every year that I work on myself the happier I am and the less episodes I slip into. I know this post is long enough but everyone on here has to know that none of this is easy. You have to fight for yourself and work on these things every day for long lasting results. You do deserve happiness even if you and everyone around you is telling you otherwise. ‚ô•"
I‚Äôm 16 with responsibilities of a 30 year old..,"So i moved away from my mom last year to live with my dad. he was crazy so i wanted to move back with my mom. he ended up calling the police on me for ‚Äòrunning away‚Äô and my stepdad decided that because of that i couldn‚Äôt come live with my mom again. so i am living with my boyfriend in a trailer that my grandma owns in a completely different town from any of my family. i have no adults helping me with food, gas, anything. i hate it so much and it is so hard to function because i am not able to have any fun with any friends because i have too many things to do, such as cleaning the house every day while my boyfriend just trashed it. i am overwhelmed and think about just ending it all a lot."
"I will randomly need to go to the bathroom and break down crying out of frustration every single day. Please help me, I don‚Äôt know what to do and feel like there is no hope left for me.","It happens almost every day. I‚Äôm so upset and with no hope whatsoever. I can‚Äôt do anything but lie in bed and think about how terrible and depressed I am. I‚Äôm a lost cause at this point. I‚Äôm worthless. There is literally nothing I can do. It‚Äôs been too long like this, suffering every day in silence and thinking about suicide all the time. I am tired of this life. I have no energy to do anything whatsoever."

"I want to share my story (molestation, anger issues, and depression). I‚Äôm scared, but I‚Äôm doing it for you guys. You are not alone.","Hi guys,

My name‚Äôs Phil, and I'm an 18 years old male. I‚Äôve never done anything like this before. But, I thought it could help at least one person (maybe even myself) so I‚Äôm going to give it a try. Here‚Äôs the story of my years-long battle.

I would consider my life up until the age of four to be quite normal; I was good at making friends, I had a very childish ‚Äúromance‚Äù with a girl at preschool, and I lived in a stable household. It was on my fourth birthday where my life started to tread downhill. My parents had invited my best friend from preschool over to my house for my birthday party. From what I remember, the party was quite swell. I had cake and such and such, typical party. After it was over, my best friend invited me to spend the night at his house. I begged my parents, and they conceded. I ate dinner there and we were soon sent to bed (if you find it hard to read about molestation, skip to the next paragraph. I‚Äôm going to be very frank about my experience). Now, before I continue, I must say that I still think about this night vividly on occasion 14 years after it happened, and it makes me sick to my stomach every time. It has become harder and harder to make out all the details with the passing years, but how it felt is still engraved into my brain. It has made me feel like less of a man, and very much like a tool made to be used. Well, here I go. After we entered our respective beds, my friend says he wanted to try something on me that his father had done to him. I agreed. I had absolutely no clue what he meant, but next thing I knew he had put himself into my bed and did exactly what he said he would do. The same thing his father had done to him. I refuse to go into more detail for both my and your sake. After this point, it was a blur. I remember telling my mother about it and that‚Äôs about it.

After that night I had never felt the same. 

A year passed and I had enter elementary school. I didn‚Äôt have the same ability I once had to make friends with other kids. This was the beginning of my ostracization. As the years increased, so did my weight. By the end of elementary school, I weighed roughly 210lb. The increase continued into middle school where I hit a max, of I believe, 270lb. I hated myself, I was fat, friendless, and most importantly, loveless. At this point, my parents‚Äô marriage was starting to show cracks. There was constant fighting. These fights primarily were a result of my half-sister who at the time was a heroin addict (I believe she has now recovered, but I don‚Äôt know for sure). I started to grow angry at this time. Very angry. Angry at the world, my parents, and myself. I hated everything. I was very eager to start fights and to stick it to people. I remember physically assaulting a number of people that I would have considered friends because they caused me the slightest annoyance, specifically one boy, I hit multiple times. I have never said sorry to any of these people (if you happen to read this, I‚Äôm very sorry). I probably hurt them greatly and ruined their trust in others.

This anger lasted until high school where it turned into competitiveness. After developing this personality trait, I lost 100lb, which reinforced it. I had to win everything. If I didn‚Äôt, I would break down. I‚Äôve famously punched many walls, leaving many dents. As you can probably imagine this wasn‚Äôt healthy. This level of competitiveness slowly turned into sadness. With everything I mentioned up until now: my inability to make friends, my anger, my competitiveness, and my unattractive physical appearance I was one of the most hated individuals within my school. My very complicated personality mixed with my standing with my peers led to depression. I became very depressed during my junior year of high school. I was having very bad depressive episodes every night. It started to noticeably affect my school work (at this time I was fourth in my class out of 110), I felt like I had to work even harder to maintain what I had, all I had, which was my grades. To make things worse, this is when my parents got divorced. To be frank, I didn‚Äôt cry, I didn‚Äôt care. After developing my weird personality, my parents had no value to me, but it still worsened my depression.

On a day, during the November of 2018, I tried to kill myself (if you have a hard time reading about suicide, skip to the next paragraph). This is something, just like my molestation, I have a very hard time talking about, so I‚Äôm going to keep it brief. I had decided to live with my father after the divorce, and he had a 9mm in his bedroom closet. On a day that he was off on business, I decided I was going to do it. I didn‚Äôt even write a note, I didn‚Äôt want to be remembered, I wanted to be silent. I remember loading it and putting it to my head. I sat there, and I sat there. Eventually, my mind brought me to this girl who had been very kind to me over the last year and how sad she would be if this was the route I took. So I put the gun down, and I cried.

Now, a year and a half later, here I am. I‚Äôm now on 20mg of Lexapro after my doctor noticed my depression. I still experience depressive episodes now and then (a lot more recently because of the coronavirus outbreak). I‚Äôm now getting prepared to go to my dream college, and I feel like I have some semblance of control in my life. There is a lot I didn‚Äôt talk about in this, including my experiences with alcohol abuse and my personal relationship with the girl that in essence stopped my suicide, but I didn‚Äôt want to make this too long. Now that all is pretty much said and done, what advice can I give? 

-Live for the dreams you‚Äôve yet to see materialize.

-Live for the people you haven‚Äôt met that you‚Äôll make smile.

-And, given the aforementioned, live the life you want. Live the dreams *you* want, and make the people *you* want to smile. 

I hope this shows at least one person that they are not alone. If you think no one cares about your situation, I do. Thanks for reading this.

Post: I wrote this at 3am. If there‚Äôs any errors, I‚Äôll fix them in the morning. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs all over the place, I‚Äôm very bad at writing about myself. If you want to reach out to me and ask questions, feel free. Thanks again for reading this. I encourage anyone who has been through depression to post their story as well, there are many people hurting in the world right now.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for the kind words. I‚Äôm happy to hear that some of you have taken inspiration from my story. That makes me extremely happy!"
Does anyone else physical hurt when they try to do things they use to like?,"For about the last couple months, anytime I tried to draw or read or just listen to music I‚Äôd get this sinking, stabbing feeling in my stomach.... I don‚Äôt know what to do but I missing being able to do things.

Edit: Oh geez this got a lot more responses then I was expecting. Thank you! The comments make me feel a little better and seeing that I‚Äôm not the only one with these feeling is reassuring. I‚Äôll try some of the things you guys suggested. Thank you again!"
The most amazing thing happened today.,"I have been battling my depression for over 3 decades. I have tried things and some helped for a time. I decided at the beginning of this year it was time to start trying to get professional help for all the issues I have been dealing with. I woke up today and the most amazing thing hapoened. 
  I felt ok.not just that bur I actually had the thought that my life really isn't so bad . I thought that to myself with no prompting. And I looked outside and thought what a beautiful day it was.
  At my last appointment I had early in April I was prescribed something for my anxiety and depression and I was told to not expect any results for atleast 3 weeks.
 I asked my husband to let me know if he noticed any differences and last night he mentioned I wasn't responding normally and today even said I was being chipper.
  I don't know how long this will last but I am happy to report that for the first time in a long long time I actually have hope and am feeling pretty good.
 Things can get better."
I reached out for help and no one listened.,"Today I was on the sofa and i felt a crushing boot on my chest. I have been in a rut these past two weeks, the same kind i fall into from time to time where i simply shut down, and I reached out to my friend and he didn't want to listen. He was happy today and he felt like i was dampening his good mood as i began to talk. I couldn't bear it so i fell quiet and lied down. I listen and listen daily, to everyone and everything, i give advice and support, but today i was hurting and wished to share and he didn't want to listen. No one does so I'm usually okay with it. I like listening and being the receiver. But today was different. Today i woke up with no wishes to step forward. 

I'm okay not sharing since my other friend is usually always busy and has her own close friends. My mom doesn't understand it so i can't tell her. My psychologist is absent due to an illness. Today the boot crushed me till i cried, and i don't cry at all.

I've fallen into the same rut i fall into after a good batch of ""productive weeks."" Where i fuck off and ruin my progress. No workout, eating too much, staying up late, watching garbage, no writing my book, no work done on my videos, procrastinating, numb, alone. Feeling worthless. Wishing for company. Having none. Where my self esteem dwindles every second as i type this at midnight when i should be sleeping. But nobody's listening, so its okay."
I just want to stay in my bed and cry,"I don't want to do anything, I just want to stay in my bed and cry. I'm still eating which I guess is good but I'm spending so much money on deliveries because I can't be bothered to go grocery shopping or cook. 

I managed to fold some laundry yesterday but I couldn't bother to actually put it away so it's all neatly folded on the floor.

I just want to be happy.

I go out and lay down on the grass instead of my room get some sunshine but it just makes me sadder that everything is so beautiful and I'm not happy.

I tried to hang out with friends but I don't have a good time, I wish I did but I just don't.

I just want to be happy but I can't stop crying."

Depression....My coping mechanisims,"## 49 yo Male.......These are the top 10 things that have helped me cope with depression for the last 15 years. Just thought i'd share them with you

1. Sleep: Go to Bed before 10pm. Get 6-8 hours solid sleep if you can.
2. Exercise: Walking, Cycling, Swimming. If you can, do them all and as often as you can. Forget Gyms, get out in the Fresh Air. Get back to Nature.
3. Medication: Find the correct AD dosage and stay on it until your doctor says otherwise. No shame in taking medication.
4. Meditation: Buy some good tapes and learn meditation and mindfullness. Practice daily. I takes a while to get use to it so be patient.
5. Reduce External Stressors: This is a hard one but if your job is way too stressful, change it or leave it. Not easy i know but without your health, you've got nothing.
6. Stop living in the past: If you've made mistakes in the past which contribute to your condition, let them go. You will never be able to change what has already gone. Forgive yourself, learn from those mistakes and perceived failures and move on. Just try not to repeat any of them going forward.
7. Kick bad habits: If you take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol, stop now. These are non-negotiable for someone who suffers from depression.
8. Loneliness: This is by far the most difficult to address and is a huge problem in modern society. All i can say is if you have family and friends nearby, meet and talk with them often. They saved my life. If you can't do this and you feel like shit, at least try and ring a local help line.
9. Keep yourself clean and tidy: Wash each day and put on some clean clothes. It'll make you feel better.
10. Remembering 1) - 9)

Remember, you are special and unique. There is only ever going to be one of you....ever.

You can beat this."
"If you are alone in your room right now, and you have some time to spare...",#NAME?
Does anyone else get hurt by what people say on reddit,"I'm actually loosing my will to live by being on here. my real life also has its obsticals but then people criticize me even when I'm asking for advice on a topic.

On a differnt sub, I asked about why people at work keep babysitting me. they replied ""cuz u arent as competent as u think u are"". I know I'm good at my job. I just wanted advice. I'm already suicidal. maybe I dont deserve to live if I cant even do anything right. I do well in school and even though I use a site that helps me on homework for an non imp class. I work hard and I have been for years. I've made sacrifices and my health has suffered. and then someone comes along and destroys me."
I am so full of jealousy and it‚Äôs eating me up :(,"I‚Äôm starting to become really toxic, inside anyways, and it makes me unbelievably upset. Not only because I feel I‚Äôm so full of hate but because I know this isn‚Äôt me and I‚Äôm disappointed in myself. I miss a few years ago when I could just be happy for people, and not exclusively think about what I don‚Äôt have. It feels like it invades every part of my life. One example of this was how I couldn‚Äôt even be happy for my friend who‚Äôs talking to a girl right now, like I‚Äôm unbelievably upset at myself that I can‚Äôt even be happy for my own friend."
Why is nothing fun anymore?,"(Please don‚Äôt mind the flair, I didn‚Äôt know which to add) 

I used to enjoy drawing. I don‚Äôt anymore. It all looks like shit. 

I used to read. I don‚Äôt anymore. I don‚Äôt have the attention span for it anymore. 

I used to watch movies. I don‚Äôt anymore. Nothing seems entertaining enough.

I used to love listening to music. I don‚Äôt anymore. It has turned depressing. 

Why. Why can‚Äôt I enjoy things as much as I used to. Why has it changed. Why did it have to change."
Feeling like you‚Äôve wasted your life,"This is a rough one for me to post. I‚Äôm 28 years old, living someplace that many others consider the Most Magical Place on Earth. I never finished college, have been used and abused by man after man and continue working my dead end job barely making ends meet. 

Constantly, day after day I scroll social media and am constantly reminded just how little I‚Äôve done with my life. 

When I moved away from my hometown five years ago I was on top of the world, but since then I‚Äôve been on a rollercoaster downward spiral without knowing where to turn to for help or advice. 

From contracting HIV in an unfortunate encounter, to being cheated on and lied to by the man I thought I would spend the rest of my life with things just haven‚Äôt gotten easier. 

Each and every time I think things are looking up, another issue comes to slap me on down.

It‚Äôs to the point now where I can‚Äôt even get out of bed some days to even attempt to address these issues. 

I never imagined when I left my hometown that I would have ruined my life and have nothing to live for or show for my years of independence. 

I just hate feeling this way and don‚Äôt know what to do anymore."
This is a post for all those who consider taking their own lives.,"One week ago my little brother committed suicide. I am not going to tell you how, because I don't want anyone getting ideas and I also don't want to get too personal.

He was in his early twenties, he had just started a new job he really liked, he had friends, he was dating, he had fun, he was enjoying life. At least that's what we thought, that's what it looked like. What no-one knew was that he had been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for years‚Ä¶ The news not only about his sudden death but also about his illness has left his friends and family in a complete shock. Our world has suddenly stopped turning and we have no idea how to deal with this. 

Looking back you start seeing little signs, small things that could have indicated how he was really feeling, behind all his jokes, behind his laughter‚Ä¶ not a day has gone by since he left us that I haven't cried until I was completely exhausted; that I haven't begged the universe to let me wake up from this nightmare and bring him back to me.

We were extremely close and I often let him know how much he means to me and that I will always be there for him, but still‚Ä¶ he felt alone. It was his depression that didn't allow him to see things the way they really were. And now it's too late. He can't go back, he doesn't get a second chance. We now know that he thought there was a tiny chance he might survive this, but he didn't. If you make that choice, it's final, there's no going back, not for you and not for the ones who love you.

You may think you're alone and that nobody is going to miss you, but that is bullshit. It's your illness that makes you blind.

So please, if you're considering suicide, think about all the pain your death will cause. There are people you can turn to, places you can go to that can help you. There is a way out of this suffering. I wish my brother had had a tiny bit of energy left to seek help. I know this world sucks, I really do. We have created a disgusting society that makes more and more people feel worthless, never good enough and right now I'm furious at the whole world. Please don't bow to the sick ideals of today's society. You don't have to be 'sexy‚Äô, you don't have to have a certain weight or earn a certain amount of money. All you really have to do is make yourself happy, truly happy. Reach out so someone. There is help and there are so many people who managed to come out of this and take back control over their lives.

I wouldn't wish this kind of pain upon my worst enemy, so please don't do this to the ones who love you. I know that depression sometimes makes you think 'they will be happier without me‚Äô - I can assure you, that is a lie. It's a lie your illness tells you to make you surrender. It wants to win and to do that you have to die. Don't let it win. Please stand up and fight. You don't have to fight alone, but please don't give up.

Edit: Thank you all for your support, there's not really much I can say at the moment, but please know that your kind words are appreciated"
"I'm not going to actively try to kill myself, but I wouldn't mind dying.","If it comes along, I know reflexes and all that will kick in but right now I wouldnt mind it. Everyone would be so much better off especially financially. I would be better off. My brother would get to be the focus of the family, the first one in University. He would be happier. I know at the beginning they would be sad and distraught but they would have to move on and carry on. They may not realise it but they would be better of. Dying terrifies me, just the thought of nothingness, or maybe theres an afterlife of some sorts, i'll take anything as long as I'm happy and everyone else is. I just want what I'm going through to end but it won't because it's more than just depression. There so many factors that go into me wanting to not be around its crazy. I am in pain 24/7, and am so anxious all the time. My father hates who I need to be. I was dealt such bad cards and I don't want to play anymore."
I showered today.,I got up and went to work for two hours. Came home and napped for three. Sat on couch and watched Netflix until my son came home. He‚Äôs made himself a snack and I‚Äôm totally useless. But I showered and brushed my teeth today too. I still feel like a failure.
So you want to kill yourself tonight: a message,"Recently I‚Äôve been reading posts from suicidal people who believe that they have just as much a right to a humane, chosen death as terminally ill people do. And I believe there may be a point where someone really is so emotionally broken and numb and darkened that suicide is the more humane choice‚Äîbut the thing is, I‚Äôve thought I‚Äôd reached that point before, and I came back. And I wanted to share some things that have helped me when I‚Äôve been on the edge.

I want to start off by saying that I fully accept the limits of this medium. I‚Äôm not gonna pretend that I love you or that I can say without a doubt that you‚Äôre a wonderful person. I know how much those empty platitudes like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre loved!‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe world needs you!‚Äù can be to someone who‚Äôs contemplating suicide. We don‚Äôt know each other‚ÄîI‚Äôm a stranger on the internet, no better than words on a screen. I have no stake in your life. But I know you *have* a life, I know that you‚Äôre a real person with hobbies and a sense of humour and pet peeves and a favourite colour, and knowing you‚Äôre a person who‚Äôs struggling is enough. I may not know you but I want you to live, and maybe it‚Äôs selfish because I see myself in everyone who‚Äôs suicidal and helping you is like helping myself, I don‚Äôt know. It doesn‚Äôt matter. 

When you‚Äôre suicidal, you can only really see the positive aspects of death‚Äîand I‚Äôm not denying there are some. Yes, the pain will go away, and the numbness, and whatever guilt/sadness/anger cocktail your depression has given you. 

But there‚Äôs more to it than that. If you kill yourself now, all possibilities, every glimmer of hope and fulfilling path you haven‚Äôt discovered yet, it all ends. Forever. And you will become a statistic. Your individuality, your personality, the parts of yourself that still exist even when you‚Äôre struggling to keep your head above water, all that dies with you, and you become a body to be processed and tabulated, a tally on the suicide board, a number, one more person this thing has claimed. And people you can‚Äôt even conceive of now will be effected by your death‚Äîyour pain will pass onto others in the form of guilt and grief. You will be perpetuating a cycle of pain. And you will have chosen to do it.

There are less abstract reasons not to kill yourself. You may not succeed, and instead may be condemned to an existence much worse than your current one, namely one of grievous injury, disfigurement, lifelong medical issues. Or if you do succeed, someone is going to find your body, and it won‚Äôt be dramatic and it won‚Äôt be poetic, it‚Äôll be awful and traumatising. If you succeed, you‚Äôll never be able to eat your favourite food again. The world will cease to exist. You will never sing or eat or smell or sleep again.

Live out of spite. Or fear. Or obligation. I am telling you, right now, that it doesn‚Äôt matter why you live, at least not in this moment. In this moment, what matters is that you live at all. The rest comes later. But you have to live to see it. And life is shitty, believe me I know. But as much as you might believe it, it‚Äôs not life that‚Äôs making you feel the way you feel right now‚Äîit‚Äôs that worm in your brain that does nothing but push you down, make you think you‚Äôre worthless, force you not to go to social events and then mock you for having no friends. I can‚Äôt stress enough that this is an illness, but it‚Äôs your choice whether it‚Äôs fatal.

I‚Äôm writing this because I almost killed myself tonight. I‚Äôm writing this to myself as much as to you. Two months ago I wound up in the hospital because of my near-suicide. I spent the night in a bright hallway while a schizophrenic homeless man moaned in the cot behind me and an addicted woman screamed for pain medicine in the room next to me. I heard an old man get a litre of his urine drained via catheter. That‚Äôs the hospital at 3AM. 

They gave me a sedative and after a groggy talk with a crisis counsellor, I was discharged the next morning. I drove home and everything seemed imperceptibly changed, even the buildings I‚Äôd passed every day for months, and I went back to my room where the night before I had nearly downed enough barbiturates to seriously hurt me, and it didn‚Äôt feel the same. I wasn‚Äôt cured‚ÄîI‚Äôve had low points since then and there will be more in my future, same as yours. That‚Äôs how it goes. When you choose to be a survivor, you sign up for all of it.

You learn who you are in these moments. You learn what keeps you going. And you learn that, at least for tonight, you‚Äôre not the person who pulls the trigger or takes the pills. You‚Äôre the one who survives.

***

If this post helped you, I‚Äôm grateful‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt do shit. You made the decision not to go through with it. And I‚Äôm fucking proud of you because nobody‚Äôs even going to know if you don‚Äôt tell them. You have come to the very brink of death and you have saved yourself, and in the morning you‚Äôll wake up and keep carrying on. That‚Äôs how it goes. Silent and powerful victories, and excruciating progress. The world is waiting for you."
What advise do you have for someone who is not functional anymore?,"I break down into tears every day. I get almost nothing done every day. I am doing nothing with my life and I cant make myself care enough to try to make it better. I get to the end of every day and realise yet again i have achieved nothing of substance.
The worst part is going to sleep though. I feel even worse laying in bed at the end of the day.

Someone spent about 24 hours with me recently and i am embarrassed to let them see that this is the way I am living. 

My vague motivations to do something might last a couple of hours or day but nothing ever comes to a worthwhile fruitition. So i spend yet antlother week where all i do is surf the internet and tidy the house. 

I'm really scared because I am so close to giving up and i reallt dont see any of the rewards of making the effort to be worthwhile. And im so ashamed that this is the way i have been lovong for so long."
This will get buried by other posts so whatever.,"I drove home and I dont even remember driving, I dont even think I care anymore, I'm just on autopilot, doing what ever it is anybody wants from me. Not that many people even care enough to check in, they just want to take things from me. Sometimes I think if I just dissapeared it would be better, life wouldnt be complicated, and I wouldnt have to live it anymore. It would just be easier. The end."
After Years of Struggling with Depression I've Decided to Make a difference,"I'm spending the next month fundraising for an amazing Australian charity that helps with mental health, beyondblue. 

A little bit about me:

A couple years ago I was starting to notice a change in myself. I was lethargic, bored all the time and got annoyed at every little thing. I started just not caring about anything. It wasn't until one time driving home thinking I couldn't really care if a car hit me and I didn't make it out alive. I realized at that moment that I wasn't my normal self. I still didn't get help but took time of work and seemed to get better or so I thought with nothing popping up. Then my mum died suddenly while I was home and I went off the deep end. Everything crumbled around me and I didn't even know the worst would come a year down the track. I had a blow up at my boss and that was it, I broke down and went to the doctor who finally prescribed me medication. It took time but I felt much better, I still go through bad patches and sometimes really bad patches but as a whole I've picked up my life from where I was at.

&#x200B;

Alright a little about my charity efforts:

I got an amazing response from my friends and family when I decided to post it on Facebook and I smashed my original goal of $500. I've still got a month to run on my fundraising so I'm really hoping to hit $1500 by the end with the amazing help of family and friends.

My fundraising consists of 2 fundraising events:

\- 24 hour stream on 14/2/2020 from 10am Western Australia Time

\- Fundraising Day at my sport club on 16/2/2020

&#x200B;

How can you help?

\- Checking out beyondblue and the work they do.

\- checking out the 24 hour stream (don't mind you leaving once it's done, it's more about joining in on something that can help on the day)

\- Know of any gaming company that might help out with raffle donations? Please let me know as I would love to be able to do some giveaways 

\- If you are in Western Australia and would like to come to the charity day just contact me. I would love to meet you and have you come down for the day.

\- Just reading this post I hope it helps with anyone that is currently struggling.

"My GF has severe anxiety and depression stemming from a brain tumor, I want to learn ways to help talk her through attacks pls any advice is appreciated","My girlfriend is a beautiful soul who was dealt a bad hand. She has been faced with many tragedies and had a brain tumor when she was in high school that effected her fear and anxiety part of her brain. Most days are good but she has days where she spirals out of control and talks about ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù, such as what if I get sick again with a tumor. Recently she has been saying she doesn‚Äôt even understand why she‚Äôs still here and why god let her live only to feel this way. I do my best to listen and give encouragement, but sometimes I feel lost for answers. My GF has very bright future she is about to start PA school which will come as a major challenge with stress and anxiety and I want to be able to help anyway I can. Please Reddit I appreciate any advice, I love this girl and hate to see her suffer like this."
"It‚Äôs been two years since, I‚Äôll hate myself forever over this","I can‚Äôt just get over the humiliation that my parents made me call this guy that rejected me (for an arranged marriage, because he didn‚Äôt like how I looked) and convince him to reconsider his decision. I remember pleading with him for close to an hour. I just stupidly followed the instructions and my (already abysmal) self esteem saw new lows. And he rejected me again. It comes back to me every night, I can‚Äôt seem to forgive myself for doing that to myself"
Just a reminder,"keep your head up guys, all will be well.

Try your best today, I know you can do it!

Have a good day everyone!"
TL;DR my depression is making me spend more money than I can afford,"Hello everyone!

First a bit about myself: I'm 25 y/o and struggling with a mix of depression and (social) anxiety. I was in therapy for about 9 months and getting medication since the end of therapy (now for about 8 months). 

At first my meds helped me very much; I experienced a somehow ""high"" in the first two months of medication. I felt more alive and *me* since... well, ever. Everyone told me I glowed so much and changed for the better. I laughed more, was more active and just felt great.

The downside was that the euphoric reaction I experienced made me spend money because I thought ""well, what could happen?"". In this time I also got a new, higher paying job and one thing led to another. More money meant I could spend more, and because of this euphoric mood I felt that nothing bad could happen to me. Guess who made debts in the last 8 months since then. In the first three months of my meds I spent waaaaay more money than I could afford and I'm still carrying those debts with me.

&#x200B;

I'm so fucking sick of this ups and downs of this. I always had some problems with money, but those months completely destroyed my finances. And because of that I feel so absolutely down. I have about 2.000‚Ç¨ debts from simply ***SHOPPING***. I have no idea how to get rid of those debts and just as I was thinking it could not ever get worse, it got worse and my healthcare provider just charged me with over 600‚Ç¨ because of some dumb fees I should have payed the last months (new job and all). I hate everything about me right now and feel like I'm just a burden to everyone, especially to my hard working bf who's trying to help me with my finances. I simply don't want him to pay so many things for me just because I'm so stupid. 

Just needed an outlet to rant sooo, if you all read this far: congrats, you made it!"
Make your Hope Box,"There is a thing called Hope Box. The Hope Box is a Box where you put reasons to live. 

for example; 
   -old Photos that make you happy
   -poems that you like
  - songs that make you more happy
  and other things 

The Hope Box serves to give you hope, and happyness. I Have one and always that i am thinking of suicide i open my hope box."
I can finally say that I‚Äôm a College Graduate,"last year i posted a story of my dreadful life in studying music in a university. it was a tough year and i was really happy and most thankful that you guys were very supportive and helpful in the comments. i followed every advice on taking everything slowly. practicing piano 1-2 hours a day upto 4 hours a day. 

everything went great when 2020 came. passed my auditions and scheduled my recital last March 14, 2020. i was the last one to perform but everything went wrong because of the pandemic. my school closed down by March 13. i wasn‚Äôt given a chance to just perform by March 14. and our graduation supposed to be on last March 21. they didn‚Äôt allow me and my family were very disappointed. all our plans were wasted.

i came home to our hometown with a broken heart. i kept my chill so i can prevent severe episodes during the lockdown. i have small cries in the bathroom and anxiety attacks during late night hours. i did my best to breathe.

our college of music dean told me to have an alternative. i‚Äôll send raw footage of me playing my piano pieces. once i send those videos, the dean will certify that i‚Äôm a graduate of the university. (because the recital is my final requirement for me to be able to graduate). of course, it took a while because i recorded a lot so i can send the best videos.

and just tonight i sent them all and felt very nervous because it‚Äôs already late.

it was checked and got critiqued. and then the dean said, ‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù. and then, that was that. it‚Äôs done. and at last, after 7 years...i can finally say that i‚Äôm a College Graduate. i cried so hard my family laughed at me for my ugly tears of joy. they were very glad and made ‚Äòem proud.

i would like to thank everyone in this sub. i may not know you, you may not know me and you may forgot that story i posted but this reddit sub helped me cope up. i helped people here too even though i myself was feeling miserable. i read some comments to some posts and learned a lot.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

How can we seek help while the rest of the world is shutting down?,"Depression is difficult enough on its own, but with the ongoing Coronavirus scare, human interaction is getting far more limited by the day. Even my psychiatrist is only doing appointments online for the next 8 weeks. Being stuck at home with nowhere to go and nobody to see is the perfect recipe for suicidal ideation. 

How can those already suffering stay hopeful when so many resources are very limited? What can stop someone from wanting to kill themselves when the world is in crisis mode itself?"
psychiatric hospital helped me turn my life around,"Hello again! 
I wrote in not knowing if I was going to take antidepressants. I got admitted to a psychiatric hospital a week ago and it changed my life. I was put on antidepressants every morning and anxiety medication. My out look on life has been flipped and I feel like I'm no longer in a haze. 
It does get better I promise
You are not wrong
You are a good person 
And you don't have to go through this alone. 
Thanks!"
"My boyfriend told that he was very depressed and after a major breakup he tried to commit suicide, three times. After he told me this, I feel devastated. How can I cope with that and support him?","EDIT: Thank you so much everyone, your advices are gold ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Just have no energy to do anything all day every day and feel empty,"I‚Äôm so depressed to the point where I just feel empty. I don‚Äôt do anything any more. Just sit in my room mainly. I have exams currently and I can‚Äôt study for more than 20 minutes without taking a 4 hour break. Any task that I need to do is dwelled over for hours on end before actually being done. I don‚Äôt have any courage, any willpower, any energy whatsoever. I feel lost and don‚Äôt know how I can stop being like this. There‚Äôs so much other stuff wrong with me I haven‚Äôt said here.

I got cheated on by my now ex-boyfriend of six years and I feel worthless,"First time poster here. On mobile.

I've known this guy since we were in middle school, we started talking during high school, and after a failed attempt at my life I dropped out of college moved back home and we ended up dating.

This guy had been my rock for all those years. He experienced with me the pain of having my dad get a stroke, my only uncle on my dad's side pass away, being diagnosed with ovarian cancer, having my dad's mom pass away, my dad have a second stroke, and finding out my mom had breast cancer and going through chemo.
Things weren't always perfect.

I nagged a lot on things he did because he tend to me reckless and not have a plan. Overall I just wanted things to be better for him. To be prepared and essentially have a backup plan.
This year he started going through a rough phase at work, being in a call center and having upset customers he would take it to heart when they would tell him to kill himself. For a very long time I told him to find someone to talk to, to go look for a counselor. He never did and I saw him get worse and worse.

I tried being the best support I could for him. It was only fair and obviously I did it because I loved him.
On the November 7th he finally spoke to a counselor. I asked how it went and he said it went well.
Then on November 9th he asked to speak to me once I arrived home from being out of town. He arrived at my house after work. He begins explaining to me that when he was talking to his counselor he was asked what made him happy and responded with photography. He mentioned that he never thought of us. Which is fair because it had been rocky.
He said he didn't love me anymore.
He finished what he said and waited for me to reply. I was in shock. I didn't realize just how bad it was. It was like a curve ball was thrown at me. I didn't know because he never opened up to me even when I asked.
He then proceeded to ask if I wanted to join him on trip which just took place this Monday through Wednesday. 
In that moment I got angry. How could you tell me to go on this trip when you just told me you didn't love me? It wasn't logical.
We argued and towards the end he said he was done. I asked him to clarify and he needed some space from me.
Fine.

I let him be until he contact me on Sunday the 10th wanting to meet up the following day.
We didn't end up meeting up on Monday and did a follow up instead on Tuesday.
We talked. I was worried for him. I told him that people were concerned for his safety and he just laughed it off with the laugh of a maniac. He said that why did people care. He was so distant.

Before I left I asked again where we stood. And he told me to give some time. I asked for how long and he told me he would let me know.
Fast forward to this Monday. He told me to have any false hope of getting together.
We went on our trip and I noticed he was texting a lot while trying to angle himself to hide his phone. It was something I noticed right away. We moved on through the day. We got to our destination.  While laying down on my bed he came laid down next to me. It was odd because he didn't want to be close to me previously. We went about our day. Came back to our Airbnb and as I was laying down again he came into my room again and fell asleep next to me.
After our naps we went out to explore the town. Had a couple drinks went back to our Airbnb and ended up sleeping together.

The day of the concert having woken up from a hangover we just stayed in had some breakfast and watched the hearing. We eventually got ready for the event we were in town for.
We ended up getting to the venue early enough where the line was already forming. We decided to stay and just wait it out.

During this time I noticed he was texting someone a lot. I read the name and realized it wasn't someone I was familiar with. I clicked on me what might be happening, with being on the verge of a panic attack I asked him if he was talking to someone else and he could just as nswr honestly. He told me no, that it was just a girl that was a friend. I wasn't buying it. We went through the concert. Went to the local bars had two drinks and headed back to the Airbnb.
I didn't want to be the fool so I did what needed to be done where I could get answers. I looked through his phone. Sure enough, he was talking to someone else. I didn't know how to handle the situation but I knew I needed to make aware the other party of my presence. I told them who I was, how long I've known him, and the status we were in. I then added them on Snapchat and sent them pictures of us through the years to proof that I wasn't lying and that I wasn't just anyone.

As soon as he woke up he saw his phone and knee something was up because she sent him a message. That if he had a girlfriend that he should have told her that way she would have kept it more friendly.
I ended up messaging her for quite a while and basically becoming more aware of the situation as he had lied to her as well that he hadn't been dating me since August.

He wouldn't speak to me and he wouldn't care to admit that he was a liar and cheater.
He decided he would be taking an Uber to the bus station because he couldn't stand being with me. It didn't work out as plan and he ended up leaving back home with me.
Once we got closer I confronted him. I couldn't keep in what I was thinking and wanted to let him know what I felt. It sucked.
He said he hadn't loved me for a while.
That when he said he wanted to get married that it was just a lie.
Through all this I couldn't get him to see that he had lied and cheated.
We argued the rest of the way home.
At the exit to his apartment I made a comment of how if he cared for the person he was talking to he wouldn't have been a liar. That triggered him. He went into a screaming rage in my face while I was driving on the highway. It was verbal abuse. I feared for my safety in that moment and so I pushed him back. That made him even more enraged and put our lives in danger by grabbing a hold of my steering wheel and attempting to swerve us off the road.
I ended up dropping him off at his apartment a few minutes after that and asked for my things back.

Since I still had the girl on Snapchat I watched as how he had already rebounded not even after dropping him off.

And so now I'm just here. Feeling worthless.
I cared for him
I loved him.
But I didn't even recognize him anymore and all I ever wanted to do was help him feel better.
He didn't even have a regard for me anymore. He didn't even have the guts to tell me straight forward that he was breaking up with me and masked it with the excuse of needing space. And so I've been writing this since 5:23 AM and now it's 6:29 AM. I don't know how to feel. But I feel worthless.


dit: during our argument he brought up that I had ruined our trip to Seattle which happened the last of August of this year. I ended up taking 40mg of sativa which he said I would be fine. I then proceeded to trip out because of a bad joke. He started mocking me that obviously I had to fee bad. And I did start feeling bad because I couldn't control my mind and I was going suicidal. I told him that. But he still said you ruined my time that I could have been spending time with my friends."
I just don't have the energy to socialize with people,"I'm so fucking tired. I'm tired of my job, my home life, myself. I'm so exhausted all the time that socializing with a group of people is way too much work and it's so fucking emotionally draining.

It doesn't matter how much someone wants to hang out, I cannot and will not hang with them because it's so fucking miserable for me. I just don't feel the same enjoyment other people do during group hangouts. It feels like a chore. I feel nothing and everything all at once. How hard is it for someone to take the hint that someone else just isn't in the right mindset to be social???? It's so fucking difficult and not a lot of people understand that."
Depression has completely ruined my life,"I've had low self esteem since 13.

That low self esteem then evolved into depression and it has ruined my life...

I'm 30 years old, never had a date (let alone a girlfriend) or even a first kiss, no real job experience, $5K net worth, can't drive a car, obese, no social skills, I've lost all my friends and family because I isolated myself from them, and no matter how much self improvement I do, all I just is discover more problems about myself that need fixing.

The last time I ever felt happy in any way was during childhood. I can't believe how my family and friends never thought ""hey, he used to be so happy as a kid and now he's a boring, overly silent adult who isolates himself at every family function, I think something is wrong with him"".

My entire 20s, the time everybody regards as their best years, were spent drugging myself with video games, porn, and unemployment.

I've never put myself out there to meet a woman because I never felt good enough in any way, even when I was young. For 17 years I've felt nothing but loneliness and believed that I didn't deserve any love.

I read and see all these people in their 20s and 30s, all happy, surrounded by people who love them who are just as happy. All I think is ""Why me? Why can't I be happy that like? What did I do to deserve this?""

Now at 30, I feel that by the time I fix myself, I will be too old to enjoy it and too old to have a family."
Can you become so depressed you start to act psychotic??,I‚Äôm starting to think I‚Äôm going crazy?
Loneliness is eating me alive.,My life is a mess and I have absolutely no one. I can't keep going.

It's actually getting better!,"I don't know if this is relevant to this subreddit, I'm just so excited I have to share this with someone.  


I've been on a intense journey to recovery for the past month without really seeing progress. And when I say intense, I mean every second has been dedicated to getting better. But all of the steps I've took didn't actually make things better, but rather just prevented me from harming or killing myself. Basically I've stayed in the sattle while still being terrorised. And it never felt worth it, until now! 

&#x200B;

Tonight I got 7 or 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep! And for the first time I genuinely believe there's hope for me.

  
Sticking to recovery has been the hardest most un-gratifying thing I've done in my life. But I'm sticking to it! I'll still take all the small steps, and whatever it takes. And whenever I'll start to question it, I'll have this to look back at, and know it works, it just takes time and patience.

She cheated on me,"Yesterday I found out that my GF cheated on me with my best friend, he told me that she felt lonely and she felt sad while she was with me and they started talking and ...

She used to tell me that I complete her and that I make her the happiest girl on the planet...

She told me she wants to marry me, she wants to be with forever...

I bought her a ring and wanted to surprise her but the next thing I know was that she cheated on me...

Everything reminds me of her, I can't do something without crying, without imagining they say I love you to each other...

I feel like the whole world is collapsing on me and that this is the end of the line for me, what have I done to deserve this, she told me I treat her like a princess, I went way out of my way to make her happy, I did everything I could do but this is what she did to me.

I just don't want to be alive, I don't want any of this pain anymore..."
Going to a therapist today. Trying to get it to work this time.,"Im seeing a therapist, the same one I saw for like 3 months about like 4 years ago (I was about 18 turning 19) but then I had to cancel an appointment and I couldnt bring myself to reschedule. My mom was paying for it and she was never the biggest believer in my mental illness. There was a lot of pressure to drop out of therapy (common theme) and I was too scared to say what I really wanted to say. 

I was also getting out of a horribly abuse relationship with a pedophile that had groomed me since I was 13. I wasnt even aware it was abuse yet. I never talked to her about it. Safe to say I didnt really truly process any of that emotion healthily. 

Anyway I want to make the most out of it. I want to deal with my issues, depression very high up on that list, and I really want to stop being so afraid of that man. 

Im not sure how the etiquette of therapy works, can I just walk in and be like ""Hi I have severe crippling and constant anxiety and depression also a lot of abuse and trauma Id like help with pls thank you"" I dont wanna overload her by dumping it all out there but like I dont want to just talk about my week. I want actual help. 

I went back to this therapist because shes really nice and I trust her. Idk if shell even remember me. 

I want to fix my head then I believe Ill have the energy and the drive to fix my body. Right now working out and eating healthy are impossible when all I do is sleep and eat like 3 pieces of candy a day on my really bad days. 

Does anyone have any experience with therapists? I really want to make sure Im not rude or whatever by putting everything on the table the first meeting."

Social Security insists I am not  eligible to get help, but I can't hold down a job. I feel like the world  is telling me I am not welcome on this earth. I am tired of being a  pariah, a ""freak of nature"". I didn't fucking choose to be born this  way. I am tired of being poor and destitute because I happened to be  born with a disability. I am tired of people constantly telling me it  will get better. It doesn't. The only way out of this torment I can see  left is to end it all."

"26. Depressed, socially anxious, lost and suicidal.","Since i was a little boy I have always been shy. The problem is I never really grew out of it. I have always sheltered myself from doing normal things that probably would have helped me break out of my shell. Now i am 26 and I cant stop dwelling on all of the experiences and fun I have missed out on because of my depression and social anxiety that i had and still have. Even as a little kid I had this problem. For example almost every first day of school I had I cried and wanted to go home. Even at a few of my birthday parties i cried. My parents tried to get me to play football and i even was told i was going to be the quarterback but I stopped going before the season even started because I was afraid and embarrassed to say ""hike"" in front of my parents. Looking back I just wish i could be happy like everyone else. I also feel like I lived in the shadow of my 3 older siblings and a lot the energy and focus of my parents was on them, my oldest brother especially. One of the happiest times of my life was the 6th grade, I was in the cool ""clique"" at school. I had a lot of friends, one of them being a girl I had a crush on for a couple years before that and I had a lot of confidence and finally began slowly coming out of my shell. After that school year my parents sold our house and we moved to a different town. I knew my parents wanted to move for a while and honestly it was my biggest fear. This devestated me. I literally was in fetal position crying for at least 2 weeks after we moved into the new house. I went from a happy kid to a suicidal 12 year old within a short amoumt of time. Like i said always dealt with shyness and depression but I feel like this put me way back into a hole I could not get myself out of and has turned me into the man i am today. I spent the next 2 year's in middle school wanting to end my life. A big part of my brain focuses on high school and that fact that I pretty much did nothing during it besides smoke weed and drink. I had freinds but I feel like they werent genuine freinds, just other people who enjoyed partying like i did. Most of the summers I spent alone sitting at home. It was like that in middle school too. I remember joking to a kid on the bus in middle school, telling him ""I go home and stare at my wall for hours then i go to school"". I never had a girlfriend in high school ( just a few hook ups). I regret not joining the track team (multiple people said i shouldve, I was really fast). I wish I had an intimate relationship in highschool. I was always pretty smart but I really just stopped caring about my grades at the start of freshman year. I had a lot of angst and spite against my parents and I attribute that to why I stopped giving a shit. Pretty much all i thought and cared about in high school was smoking weed. I shouldve been focused more on joining a club and my grades. Although marijuana was a huge escape that I initially loved I feel like it was one of the worst choices I made because it only made me more introverted. It also made okay with the fact that i was doing nothing with my life and not thinking about my future. I had one job as a bus boy which i quit after about 2 months. I graduated high school as a below average student wirh absolutely no clue what I wanted to do in college. I went to a community college for a month before dropping out. While there I felt extremely out of my element, only talked to fellow freinds from high school who also went there, and made zero new friends because of my social anxiety. After dropping out my life as an extreme recluse began. I worked but it was with my dad doing roofing and home improvement type work. I only hung out with one friend from high school and going to his house and getting drunk with his family at their house parties was the extent of my social life during this time. I spent most of the money I made with my dad on weed. This is how life was for about 8 years. Around 2013 i began taking lexapro and took it until Feb 2019 but it didn't really help. My oldest brother ended up overdosing form heroin 4 years after I graduated high school. I had a moment where i said to myself ""enough is enough, stop smoking, get your shit together and do something with your life"" but that was short lived. A year after that we moved to Florida. This move didn't really fuck me up as much as the first one but it did affect me a little as I do not like change in general. My drinking increased since I moved down here and I smoked just as much. Fast forward to November 2019. I turned 26 and holy shit it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had a huge quarter life crisis and realized that the past decade of my life flew by so fast and I spent it doing absolutely nothing. I stopped smoking and stopped drinking after doing both habitually for at least a decade. I told myself I could not live like that anymore and if I didn't make a change sooner of later I would look back a decade from now and have the same regrets. I began considering joining the service but honestly had no clue what I wanted to do for a career and I still dont. I just felt like doing anything has to be better than doing nothing and it might help me out of my socially anxious depressed bubble that I am in. Unfortunately around mid November I began suffering from severe dry eye which i am still dealing with as i type this. It has cost me an insane amount of money in doctors visits and i still havent gotten better. I had lasik 4 years ago and it might be the cause (dont get lasik). This only has made me more depressed and suicidal. I also went to a cheap therapist for about a month during this time. I also went to a psychiatrist and took Zoloft for about a month and a half without any improvement and stopped because of fear that it would make my dry eye worse. One of the only positive things that has happened recently is I began talking to a girl i met on a dating site. We talk for at least 3 hours over the phone everyday. This is the most social activity ive had in a long time (even though she does 70 percent of the talking. She likes talking about herself). Hearing her talk about her life only makes me more depressed because she has done so much and made the most out of her life. I honestly have no clue what she sees in me. I shared these feelings with her and to my surprise she is still talking to me, although she doesn't really understand how it feels to have depression and pretty much told me my life is not that bad. So here I am, a 26 year old socially inept man child who has no idea what he wants to do with his life. This dry eye problem is also stressing me out and i really want to get it taken care of so i can move on and do something productive with my life. I really think the military would be a good thing for,mw but I don't want to enlist until my eyes feel better but i also feel like time is running out because i can't join once I get past a certain age. I dwell on the past everyday and i wish I could go back in time. When I think about the past I get depressed and when I think about the future i get anxious. I get so anxious even thinking about being around New people because they will judge me and think i am too quiet. I also am afraid if someone asks about my past and my highschool/college life what do I tell them? I dont want to tell people I was a pothead who did nothing in Highschool. I also feel like im playing catch up in learning social skills when everyone else my age just has those skills naturally. I don't know what to do from here."

"Skipped school to kill myself, didn't go through with it, what now? Please help me, anyone.","Hopefully this all makes sense, confused and tired right now, and I'm going to not go through and re-read anything like I usually do as I know I would probably just end up deleting this post, so hopefully this isn't too confusing. It'll also be long probably, sorry for the long read, but I need to at least get down all of what happened. Just need some advice/support, or whatever please, I'm not really sure what I need, like I said, I'm not in the best state of mind currently.

&#x200B;

I've skipped school maybe 5-6 times this year when things were too much, as school is one of my biggest stressors and I don't even see the point sometimes, just to get a mental break. I've never done much on those days other than lie around, or maybe play some video games if I felt like it. These were the worst days for me, constant suicidal thoughts since my parents and brothers/sister wouldn't be home, either at school or work. These are the days that I kept toying with the idea, feeling safe (in a weird way, I know) that I could kill myself if I needed to. I haven't skipped for about a month or so, but all throughout yesterday I was thinking as I get closer and closer to graduation, there's a ""time limit"" of sorts on when I'm actually going to go through with it, as it gets closer and closer I feel more pressure that I ""have"" to do it, because I feel like I need to kill myself before I graduate high school, I'm not sure why. Today I woke up at 6:30, and as soon as I got up I was already battling with the idea of whether or not to go to school, and this thought stayed with me throughout breakfast, throughout my shower. I told my brother, who I normally walk to school with, that my alarm woke me up late and that he'd better walk to school ahead of me if he didn't want to be late, so he left. I literally did nothing for the next 30 minutes to an hour, literally felt nothing, just thinking about what I was going to do. Then after that I just went to my bed, and started researching for maybe 3-4 hours, methods, what to expect, etc. etc., all these things that I had been too scared to look up before. Found out the way I wanted to go, was literally about to go find the things I needed, but was so scared that I wanted to delay it somehow, even though I was still determined to go through with it. I told myself that I would set a timer for 30 minutes to sleep, and after that if I still wanted to kill myself, I'd do it after that. Well when I woke up, I felt a little different, a little more hopeful, I'm honestly not sure why, just hopeful enough to not kill myself today at least. Now I have to figure out what to do next. I had a math test today, an ap macro final, a small spanish presentation, and an anatomy quiz. It just seems so so so overwhelming, like I can't deal with it and I don't even know where to start, or what to say to the teachers, or if I can still take them, or what I tell my dad when the school calls today to tell him I wasn't there, or what to do about trying to manage this so I don't end up going through with my plan tomorrow, or the day after that, or next week.

I really, really, appreciate any help at all. Feeling really lost right now. Sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading if you managed to get this far."
"How to be ""you"" when you are not sure who ""you"" is","&#x200B;

I am a 20 yr old in college. I used to think I knew who I was.

Example: I used to think I found beauty in math. Then I delved into more and more difficult math courses, and I eventually convinced myself I was too stupid to do it and could not appreciate its beauty any more.

I used to think I knew a lot of other stuff about myself too. It was comforting. Events took those certainties away from me, and now I realize myself as a dynamic being, and my identity can't really be defined by anything nor am I really comfortable defining it, since it is always subject to change, always subject to something I hadn't seen before that I can see now, or at least realize I can't see. Why pigeonhole myself to believing the same thign all my life?

To be in this constant state of questioning and openness to change is in a way terrifying. I feel as if there is no stability in who I am as a person. People say just to be ""you"" but the thing is I'm not sure who I am. Because to me it all depends. Who I am right now could be different from who I am tomorrow. And moreover I am not *confident* in the person who I am now because I know how little I know, and how ill informed most of my decisions likely are. This is a huge source of depression for me.

On the flip side I feel like people who think they know who they are are ignorant. I believe we are all constantly being changed and affected by the experiences in life and people's personalities change depending on context. And if people try to act the ""same"" thorugh it all it just means they are shutting themselves off, preventing themselves from being sculpted by life.

But is that a bad thing? Should you completely open yourself up to life, and let it sculpt you? What if your life has been traumatic? Should you not let life sculpt you at all, perhaps retain idealist values and cling tightly to them, maintaining the integrity of the sculpture, making it stand the test of time? Somewhere in the middle maybe?

**The verdict is I am struggling to develop a healthy relationship with myself.** In one way, I don't want to associate myself with any form of identity because its limiting my growth as a person. On the other hand, I feel like some form of identity is absolutely necessary to a healthy being with a good relationship with oneself. People find other people who have a strong sense of self attractive and fun to be around. While I might've used to be this person, I just can't put so much faith into my self anymore, its so unfinished, so incomplete, I feel pathetic.

Perhaps to find myself I need to revert to my emotional urges and impulses, but I don't want to submit to those really, because they are not much healthier than not having a self. Perhaps I need to make my identity some sort of wanderer, and gain my certainty from the act of wandering and navigating through the eternal grey area that is life.

**I DONT KNOW, and I DONT KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN KNOW.**

Someone please give me your thoughts, and thanks."
Does anyone else not feel heard?,"Sometimes I feel like people aren't hearing the real me, especially those closest to me.  Asking for help is the hardest thing for me and when I feel like they don't understand the severity of me asking for help it can push me deeper and deeper into the dark spaces.  Has anyone else felt this way and have any tips that might help?"
"My boyfriend is depressed, I want to help the right way","Hi, so I'm not sure if I'm right here, but my boyfriend is having a severe depression since he is maybe 14. He is getting help since one year and takes serious dose of medication. We've known each other since eight month. He is lovely, he is just the right guy for me and in my eyes he is perfect. He actually is always tired, in this state most of you probably know, but I think he is getting a little better. 
Only he has those phases where you just feel nothing and at the same time kind of despair and don't have any self-worth and I can't find the right words really. I hope you know what I mean. Well I don't know what to do. I always offer him to talk to me and say what he currently is feeling, only if he wants to of course, but he just says that since it is the same thing every time he just needs to get through it. I don't know if that is good for his mental state this believe, because I think he thinks he is troubling me by talking about this, but it is not. I have told him that I will listen even if it is the same thing every time and that he does NOT waste my time! Still I feel really helpless if he is in this state of mind and I'm not even sure if I should say anything. And if you guys can tell me if there is anything you would like someone to say, do for you when you are in this state of mind, could you tell me? Maybe that will help me to say the right words, or show him my support the right way or that I should just leave him pass through it.. 

I of course realise that everyone in their depression is different and that there is not *the* right way, still maybe it helps."
Can‚Äôt escape politics and it‚Äôs making me not want to exist,"I‚Äôm so sick of hearing about politics. Liberals and conservatives are constantly in these arrogant screaming matches over who is right, and it‚Äôs so pathetic that it‚Äôs drawing all the energy out of me.

We‚Äôre destroying the earth and still have to argue whether or not this is a real issue.

I‚Äôm trying to fight inside myself just to get through the day and go to work and be there for my family but underneath it all I have this deep seething depression that nothing I do matters and that humans are just slowly fostering more and more hate.

I can‚Äôt handle it, and I feel powerless and I just don‚Äôt know how to get through this.

Edit: wow, thank you all so much for these replies. You all helped so much and I‚Äôm bookmarking this page to come back and read it when I start to feel down again. These replies inspired me to delete my Facebook and twitter accounts, as they were only causing me anxiety. My dead end job often increases my depression but I‚Äôm going to look into volunteering to find something proactive to do in my city. Thank you for reading my plea for help and for caring enough to respond. You all truly helped me and these replies will stay with me... I know my depression and darkness will come back, but I feel more equipped for coping.

I feel heard, and I thank you."

How do I gain confidence when almost every person I've talked to has put me down for my appearance?,"I feel so fucking hopeless, even though  I've been working out, trying to gain some healthy weight and muscle, naturally a quiet but nice person who genuinely cares what people think and how they feel. Been adding protein and healthier food options, and attempting to add more daily calories to my diet as to help me look less skinny and more healthier and fit. But at the same time it's honestly for nothing, I'm worthless and people make sure to remind me of that. I don't know how I was placed on this earth for basically every single person I've spoken to, to make me feel like a worthless piece of shit. I'm only 19 and I feel so fucking ugly, I've been told by the nicest prettiest girls that I, ""Look like an old man."" on multiple different occasions. Do you realize how fucking painful that is? Imagine if I told that same girl, ""You look like a 50 year old lady."" I fucking guarantee you she'd have been heartbroken from hearing that. How the fuck am I the only person in the world who thinks about how my words can possibly hurt someones feelings? Am I the only person who thinks before they speak? My own family has teased my appearance including high school teachers. I've heard friends of mine overhearing teachers making fun of me behind my back. My OWN friends make fun of my appearance straight in my face. It's impossible to have self confidence when you've literally been proven to be fucking hideous, people don't tease me to share a good laugh. They do it because I'm genuinely ugly and nobody cares about how depressed I am and how I have literally not a single person to talk to. I can't get suicide out of my head I don't wanna live with other humans if they're just gonna make me feel shunned and worthless. I really don't know what to do. I've tried to make myself the best person I can be but nobody gives me a crumb of appreciation. All my hard work literally doesn't mean anything to anyone and nobody cares. 

Sure I'm doing all this self care for myself, but I need to feel  accepted by someone. I've never had a girlfriend, never had a best friend, never had someone I spiritually resonate with. I've never had anyone. I was physically abused by my father and I've been completely alone ever since. My entire existence has only been suffering and I don't understand why I'd be put here just to feel pain and suffering all while completely alone. I just bottle up all my emotions and pretend it doesn't bother me but of course it's eating away at my sanity. I don't have to be gorgeous or the prettiest man but I'm just tired of hearing how ugly I am. It breaks my heart so much I can literally feel pressure on my heart just thinking about how wrong I've been done over the course of my entire life. 

I guess the main reason I typed this all out is really to ask, how do I keep going even though I'm completely alone? How do I keep living knowing that I'm all I've ever had and nobody is there for me? How do I find the motivation to keep being a kind person when all I've been shown is repulsion for just trying to be myself. How can I find a friend or girlfriend that cares about my opinions and point of view on life without making me feel ugly and worthless. How do I find any reason not to end my life with the gun that's in the room right next to me?"
I've been a shut in for 10 years,"I had no friends in the last 10 years. Iron rust in disuse and so my social skills. I lost my ability to interact and now is very awkward person.

I'm drowning in negativity and negative people, how am i going to comeback in the society. I'm 23 years old and i don't have a job, Anybody could you please tell me what to do.

Thanks. God bless"
You are somebody's every day,"I need you to know that I'm genuinely rooting for your uplifting.

I don‚Äôt want to feel depressed anymore,"I‚Äôve been depressed for 8 years now, and long story short it‚Äôs really been getting the best of me these past 3 months. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs all crashing down now. I‚Äôm tired of feeling like this, I say I want to die but in reality I just want to escape. I finally want to be better. I just don‚Äôt know how.

How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist?,"Tl;dr at bottom

Hey guys. So, for context: I am a 14 y/o dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so open-minded, and we aren't close either. We haven't really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, here's what's I need help with:

About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didn't ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube (As it had ""rotten my brain""). He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades (Like, above 95%) but since I haven't gotten good grades (I have like a 75-80% overall), he doesn't give a fuck. I couldn't even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I don't know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and it's all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldn't give a shit (This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesn't get dirty)

After like 1.5-2 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldn't understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I don't know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is what's going on now:

I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh (It's a big city) and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like ""Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me"" but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since I'm a minor I can't be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.

Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our not-so-good relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him?

(PS: He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say I'm wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him.)

TL;DR: I am a 14 y/o Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesn't give a fuck about it. I want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. I need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and I have no idea how to approach my dad about this. We have a poor relationship and haven't talked about anything else than studies in the past 3 years or so. (Skim through the upper paragraphs because I might have left something out, I tend to do that)

&#x200B;

Update: So while talking normally, I asked my dad what he would say if I asked him I wanted to see a therapist. He reminded me that I had already asked him and he said that since there are no child therapists in India, it wouldn't do me much good. Also, he said that my issue is a lack of focus and confusion (And it is this confusion that led me to cut myself) and that since I do not have a psychological problem like depression, I can just meditate and go for walks and I'll be okay. The funny thing is, I was amused when he said that I don't have depression lol (Hopefully it didn't show up on my face)

Also, I talked to him about why he had talked the way he did when I told him about my cuts. He said that he had a long and tiring day and when I told him he couldn't process what happened and got irritated (Which is his kind of go-to emotion. Mine is laughing). I know this doesn't excuse what he said, but it's at least a reason I can get behind. He also told me to talk to him about whatever is bothering me instead of a therapist, which I won't be doing

&#x200B;

UPDATE #2: Here is the link to the letter I will be giving him. If you would like, you can go through it and let me know if I should change anything (Names and stuff changed): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mPqoXtyLRbuWboCQuACZyAZntW835uzHB3QQUFjYHZ8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mPqoXtyLRbuWboCQuACZyAZntW835uzHB3QQUFjYHZ8/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

UPDATE #3: So my dad got me an appointment with the therapist I mentioned for tomorrow at 11 AM. I'll be talking to her tomorrow and I guess I will give the final update when I come back home

&#x200B;

FINAL UPDATE: So I went to see the therapist today. We talked for about an hour and in the end, she diagnosed me with mild depression, anxiety and BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). I have been given meds for mood stabilization and am on some sort of anxiety program. I'll be going to her once every week for at least 3-4 sessions and then once every 15 days. I'm pretty sure this will be the final update, but feel free to PM me. A big thank you to everyone as all of you helped me a lot!"
I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôm going to lose my wonderful partner because of my depressive moods and anxiety,"I have days where I am happy, fun, sociable and we are so happy together. And then I have days where I‚Äôm angry, screaming, hurting myself and inconsolable. Not once has he ever ever complained, he talks me through my panic attacks and my bad days and loves me and supports me. He is amazing but I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs going to have enough one day. We are 24 and probably moving onto the next step of moving in/engagement in the next few years but I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs not going to want this life forever and move on to a happy easy going girl. I need to change now before I push him away 

Edit: thankyou so much to everyone who took the time to reply, especially those with long thought out messages. I have booked a counselling session this week and going to see my GP! Also wanting to take on all the other bits of advice that I can start doing independently. My partner and I are both experiencing periods of depression so sharing this with him so we can help each other. Much appreciated everyone, love this support all over the world. X "
DAE feel dumber because of their depression?,"I feel like I've gotten so much dumber since my depression got severe. I've always been a sort of high functioning depressive but it got really bad around two years ago. Now I struggle with speech a lot and sometimes can't remember simple words or I'll say the wrong word that's not even a word. Like the other day I was talking to a classmate and I said ""squibble"" instead of ""scribble"". Facepalm, I know. It was pretty dumb. I used to be so articulate. :( 

EDIT: thanks everyone for the responses and words of encouragement. Feels great to know I'm not alone (not that I'm happy you are affected similarly but its comforting to know I'm not the only one). I don't want to be depressed anymore. If anyone is interested in being a sort of accountability buddy to encourage each other to be better, please PM me. I am trying to get out of my depression naturally since pills really affect my memory. Anyone out there doing the same? Let me know please. :) "
What were you like before depression?,"I just had this thought... never before this happened a few years ago was I so apathetic. I had loud,bold personality. I still have it but it's numbed down. I have flashes of my old self, when I get out of my head and have energy I still feel it. 

I think I got better recently. A bit at least. Maybe thanks to quarantine. I take vitamins, started to doing some yoga and a bit of dancing, started course online (it's hard to continue it tho), and I feel like at least I'm not down in the dumps lately.

So I just wanted to hear from you... what were you like?"
It will be ok,"
hey. you

you might not be in the best of spots in life right now. you might be the happiest you've ever been in life. that is beautiful. for those who aren't feeling so great right now, i need you to know that things get better. i cant stop you from the nights you cry yourself to sleep. I cannot stop you from the days where it feels like no one loves you. one day you will be happy. and you will look back on this. i promise. talk to a friend, get some sleep, drink some water, have some of your favorite candy, play some videogames, go for a walk around the block. do what makes you happy. 

someone out there cares for you. 

it might not be that girl you've been crushing on since freshman year. it might not be someone you feel sad over right now. 

but someone cares. 

Even I care and I don‚Äôt even know you.

you just need to look for that person, and I promise you will find that person. 

just remember
everything you've ever done has led you to this comment. you've made it this far. 


don't give up now."
How do people do things all day?,"This whole quarantine thing got me thinking.

It's normal to me to stay in when I have free time. I basically do nothing, just playing games and watching stuff. Recently my uni classes started online (I live with my partner in our own apartment), I'm starting to sort all the stuff I procrastinated way too long, and I got back into contact with an old friend who I play games with too. 

Is this normal routine for mentally healthy people? Like, do they just do a bunch of stuff one after another without getting really tired? Do they have breaks, and what do they do in these breaks? I think I've been stuck in my own loop for so long that I feel like a really old phone battery. Fully charged in the morning, but rapidly decreasing by the minute and any task. I think I kind of forgot what it's like to function normally, cause I never really did. 

I don't know. I just hear from many people that are stuck inside how they just want to do things and go outside. And I'm asking myself - do what? I genuinely don't know how they have energy for this. I'm not ranting, cause I'm happy for these people and hope they can do these things again soon. And I'd wish I could too, but it just seems so... exhausting."
Just a reminder for you.,"You're worth it.   
People out there love you.  
Look yourself in the mirror, And tell yourself that you are worth it.  
Any of us on this Reddit will be there for you if you need a place to rant."
I started isolating myself again,"Struggled with depression for a long time, I'm currently doing ok in my life. I got sick a few weeks ago and cancelled all my plans, since then I've really struggled with making any. After work I sometimes message some people but mostly just watch TV. Every weekend my parents go out to meet friends and I stay at home alone.  I've slowly been getting back to messaging  and calling certain friends, but I keep avoiding or cancelling making plans. This is partially due to low energy but also because my self hatred is so bad that I'm convinced all these lovely people secretly hate me and don't ever want to spend time with me and I'm doing them a favor by not being in their lives as much"
Can lack of sleep increase how depressed you are?,"Hey guys. So the last 3 months I‚Äôve been pretty depressed and I really have no reason to be. I could have anything I ever wanted, but I picked up a new habit which is riding horses and every morning I have to be out there at 7 which I get isn‚Äôt bad.
This horse used to bring me joy, but now I‚Äôm only getting 4 hours of sleep per night, could that be making me more depressed."
Was made fun of for not being circumcised :(,"I was talking with other people about different inventions from people and someone mentioned that Jewish people invented circumcision. I told them I wasn't circumcised and then it all went downhill from there.

They called me a freak, they said I'll never have sex in my life and that nobody will ever want to be with me. Now all of a sudden I have a different perspective on life and I feel sad and unmotivated.

Edit: wow! Wasn't expecting this many responses. Thank you very much! I feel much better."
I did drugs today [NSFW],"I snorted some hydrocodone today in an attempt to feel something other than empty. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever done that specifically and it worked, for all of an hour. When I came down I felt even worse than before. It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve done something like that, but it is the first time I‚Äôve resorted to hard drugs to feel better. I‚Äôve struggled with depression for years as part of bipolar disorder, but it‚Äôs never been as bad as it is now. I‚Äôve had to drop out of college this semester as well as the last simply because I couldn‚Äôt reliably get out of bed. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, and I‚Äôm not really sure how I feel any of you can help. Honestly I‚Äôve thought about just ending it all, but I‚Äôve never been able to go through with it."
Is it possible to be high functioning and depressed at the same time?,I was diagnosed a couple of months ago but I‚Äôm at university and going to class and doing work. This is giving me a lot of self doubt about my depression and whether I truly have it or if I‚Äôm just over reacting.
I hate this,"I hate when I tell people how I feel they say don't be sad.. Be happy.. U can't think that way... Be more positive.. And stuff like that.... Like it's that easy.. Like I choose to be like this.. It's not easy to stop those thoughts... I don't have switch in head... I wish didn't hate myself... I wish I could turn it off... I know low self esteem is not attractive.. But I didn't choose it..  When they ask why I don't trust people or talk to people it's because of that...
But if you have read this.. Know that I know how you feel.. I know it's hard to fight your own mind..."
Got out of bed and went to class!,"Spent the past few days in a hangover induced,  severe spiral inwards and downwards; today I resided to the fact it was a ‚Äústay in bed, I can‚Äôt face the world‚Äù day.  Figured I‚Äôd just do some work for assignments from bed....I knew I wouldn‚Äôt. 

So forced myself to get up. And I‚Äôm currently at the bus stop on my way to class. 

It‚Äôs the little things. 

Hey I just got my bus ride for free  yay. "
My best friend of 10 years said she won‚Äôt care if I kill myself,"We were in a normal discussion and somehow my suicidal side was brought up. She said she won‚Äôt stop me if I kill myself and she doesn‚Äôt really care.....and people are responsible for their life, so she it won‚Äôt bother if I kill myself.

Wow.... best friend eh?

I‚Äôve always thought at least someone will care if I die.... I guess not :("
My motivation has completely disappeared and I'm feeling overwhelmed by having so much to do.,"So I'm 27, and a single mom for the last year to 2 & 6 yr olds. I'm currently a sahm working remotely for a few hours a week, going to be starting school online next month, and I will be looking for a job that provides more for my family. 
The trouble is I've been battling post partum anxiety and depression since i had my last little one. So just a little more than 2 years. 

My depression had improved greatly in the last few months but recently it's been fluctuating again (I was sick for 2 weeks and now my kids are both sick as well as my roommate) this has made things very difficult and I've had a lot of health problems at the end of last year that made it difficult to get important things done. 
Well, now I've reached a point where I have zero motivation. I just feel so overwhelmed by everything I have to get done and even making a to do list, and today sending it to my LDR partner with the idea that he will check at the end of the day to see how much I accomplished has done nothing except make me feel more depressed and anxious. 

I'm having trouble thinking, I've stopped eating properly and making sure to drink water every day (my SO has been helping to encourage me to do these things properly) and I'm just having trouble making myself focus and chill out enough to get things done. 

Today I was going to do things... but then I had kids screaming and crying all day and I couldnt do hardly anything. Now it's the end of the day, I've managed to eat and drink water today (more water than usual but not enough yet) and I'm just feeling really sick again. I dont know if its stress or if I'm just burnt out or what it is. This might not even make any sense because I'm having trouble thinking. 

I hate that I cant get myself motivated and actually accomplish things. I hate that I cant do better. I just feel like complete shit."
I cleaned my room and showered to feel better.,"Recently, my room was a mess. My room always become messy when I neglect cleaning it and it gets really stinky and my bed looks weird. Also, I can go a lot of days without showering, just because I had a bad day, or I just don‚Äôt feel like it.

Today, I decided to clean my room, and take a shower from the past few days and I‚Äôve never felt any better. I hope that I can keep this up everyday instead of periodically. 

Just a reminder, I KNOW you can do it. You have the motivation. You‚Äôre a strong individual and trust me, being clean can make you feel good. üíû"
Too depressed to even do basic things,"Lately I‚Äôm too depressed to even have the energy to do basic things like shave, shower and get out of bed. I just feel very miserable. Anyone know any solution to this? I‚Äôm already on antidepressants."
"My only pleasure in life is sleep, because we‚Äôre temporarily dead - Please show me some direction in my life","FUCK this life, why me, why us, why did we get dealt this shitty hand in life. 

I just want to be set free, all this pain to be over with once and for all and to find the love of my life.

The past two years have been hell on earth for me, everything is so difficult and the fruits of life have already died for me because I‚Äôve been trying to reach them for years!!!"
Any time I think about the future I'm overwhelmed with how much I don't want to be there,"Basically title. Whenever I try to think about what's coming I get the sense of why bother staying alive. Growing old working a job I hate. Being alone all the time because I can't relate to people. I don't even want to look for a job because either I don't get the job and wasted my time, or I did and now I have to go work at something I hate or something I'm not good at. Either way I lose. Not only am I incredibly alone but I'm also incredibly bored. Nothing has excited me for a long time. Worst of all I don't see any of these facts changing regardless of what I do. At least making it to the end of college seemed doable but making another 50 years, 40 if I'm lucky? Fuck that man."
"Does anyone else feel the urge to sabotage aspects of your life, so that people take you seriously?","I‚Äôve contemplated taking up drinking, because I feel like people would understand me more if I did. The alcohol is something more tangible than my illusive feelings. I don‚Äôt drink or smoke, yet I struggle everyday. Why? What‚Äôs wrong with me? Why am I so weak and stupid?"
High functioning depression,"Hi everyone, I've been lurking in depression subreddits for a while but I finally decided to post.

I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and clinical depression. I was diagnosed when I was 17 but since I started university my depression has become more high functioning, and there have been times when people do not believe me when I open up about my depression. Even when I talked about my PTSD from a sexual assault and a mentally abusive relationship, some people did not believe me.

I shower two times a day every day, I finish all my assignments a week ahead of time and I make sure I get near perfect grades on everything, I work 5-6 days a week, I'm a clean freak who has to do laundry and dishes every single day or else I panic. My anxiety disorder screams at me to get these things done or else my anxiety will eat me alive.

I've had people who tell me my depression ""isn't real"" because their depression had them unable to leave their bed. When I talked about my struggles with suicidal thoughts I was skirted to the side and seen as a liar, while someone else was praised for their struggles because they were unable to continue going to college due to their depression. 

I felt like screaming that depression is not a contest. It ruins lives and there is no ""one size fits all"" depression.

I just need support that my struggles are valid."
"how would've you reacted ""You can start by apologizing for being depressed""","Hey guys, this is a quote that a super dear friend of mine said when she was upset and angry at the world. I couldnt handle this quote, and I had to shut the conversation after a fuck you for that. the context is that I was naming a couple of coaping skills (cause god knows that's something I've learned a lot of in the last couple of years) and he/she said stop, I proceed ed to say, in just trying to help, sorry, (which I didnt intend at all to sound like I was mocking him or her), this was followed with this message
sorry if u dont understand but I'm still agitated and he/she wont talk to me.
I just wanted to know how any of you guys that has depression and anxiety would've reacted and how do you interoperate this quote. pls help"
I found help!,"I had been in an impossible rut for several decades. To be honest, I thought that's how the rest of my life was going to be. Down and out no matter what. Suicidal ideation, self harm, the works. I hit an extraordinary low and began reaching out all over the place for help. Even more than usual. I was afraid of myself. In the midst of all this I met a psychiatrist. The rare kind who actually wanted to help instead of just giving me whatever drug I told them I needed. And that's where my leaf actually began to turn. See, everyone else always told me it was just treatment resistant depression and that was that. My new doctor took a look at my history (and played some pretty weird mind games with me) and came to a startling conclusion. I'm not depressed at all. Well, at least not only depressed. I'm bipolar!! Type 2 to be specific with a tendency toward depression as opposed to mania. That's why nothing was ever working. 30 years of barking up the wrong tree!  Believe me, I was not happy about the news at first: ""What the fuck do you mean I'm bipolar? Have you not been listening to me this while time?"" The signs were there: good grades that dropped way off as a younger person despite ability, a low tolerance for those I didn't like, a very short fuse, overall intensity, crudeness, and so much more. But how would I have known? Everyone else just said I was depressed and a little weird. I never really questioned it. I'm on a pretty heavy mood stabilizer now and have been for a couple months. Intrusive thoughts have dropped considerably and a ton more positive changes. Things aren't perfect and they never will be but damn are they looking up!"
Been one whole year since the day I tried to kill myself and I‚Äôm happier than ever,"I was fighting depression for 6 years with it getting exponentially worse. First it was just once every couple of months for a day or so all the way to I was lucky if I got half a week where I didn‚Äôt feel like shit in a month. I met someone who I opened up to, she convinced me to get help and I‚Äôve been so much happier since. Has it been easy? No of course not. The depression will always try to find ways to sneak in things to make your life worse like pushing people away from you, making you believe you are a burden on others, all that horrible shit. But it does get better, you just have to keep on going until it does. Even the brightest sources of lights in our world like Robin Williams can be extinguished by this. 

Today I am somewhat organized in college when I thought I would have died before I graduated from high school. I‚Äôm happy and life feels amazing again. Sure sometimes there will be a part of me that misses the depression, but when I look back at how I was and how I am now, I know it‚Äôs all worth it. I know it‚Äôs worth it when my sister runs up and hugs me fighting tears saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you are still here‚Äù

Sky Williams did a video called ‚ÄúA message to the depressed‚Äù that helped me out a lot. 

Depression is a raid boss. Do not try to 1v1 it like I did. It does damage over time so be sure to have plenty of supports with you and always remember that asking for help is not a weakness, but a sign of wisdom and strength."
What are signs of depression?,"Are suicidal thoughts really a sign of depression? What about binge watching shows from my childhood instead of doing work or cleaning? Is that a sign of depression or is that just me being lazy? Inconsistent shower schedule, awkward relationship with food, not being able to engage or connect with people in your life, constantly daydreaming, etc. Like, what‚Äôs a healthy life supposed to look like? Are there actually people who wake up in the morning and start the day without feeling miserable about it? Is the key to just not think about it? 

Idk what I‚Äôm expecting the answers on this to be. Idek if this post is going to get any replies. But, I just started seeing a therapist, and I‚Äôm scared that this is it and that I‚Äôm going to be stuck like this forever. So, if anyone wants to tackle this question, I‚Äôd really appreciate it..."
Can someone maybe help give me a little encouragement to get out of bed?,"I need to shower, its been 4 days. My hair is greasy and I probably smell.  Im seeing a tattoo artist in the afternoon and I should be happy but I cant get out of this bed. I know I need to, I know I should, but it just feels like a weight on my chest. I just cant bring myself to get up and put effort into looking presentable. 

I have to shower then I have to dry my hair and get dressed and put on makeup and eat something and go outside. It just seems like too much. 

I feel guilty because I blame myself for being lazy. My depressions been worse recently because I lost what I would call my ESA last week. I had him for almost 11 years and he kept me alive. I adopted a new cat but its not the same. He hasnt been around long enough to have the same connection. It does help ease the grief a little though. I was told I was too dramatic for heavily grieving for my cat so Ive been holding it all in. I dont want to bother anyone. 

Honestly I could just use some encouragement. Some motivation maybe. Thank you for just reading this even if you don't respond."
How to get a friend to eat when they are starving themselves from depression..,"Someone I know is going through a really tough time in their life and they have fallen into a really deep depression. They‚Äôve been hospitalized because they starved themselves so much and have lost 30 pounds in 3 months. They ate a bit when my friend was with them and it seems drinking is a little easier at times but they are really lacking in good sustenance.
For anyone who has faced this or knows some who has, what have you used to keep yourself more healthy during this time? I saw that some people use supplements like Soylent when they get into those states but I‚Äôve never been in this position and want to do everything I can to help and keep them as healthy as possible. Thank you üôèüèº"
I thought college was supposed to be better,"Everyone always told me that when you get to college, everything is better. You meet more people like you, you make so many friends, and every thing is great. But ever since I've gotten here I feel like my depression has spiraled out of control. I look around and see everybody seemingly having a good time and I feel like shit; I should have more friends and I should go out more but instead I'm just stuck with nothing and no one. I am so, so lonely and I just feel as if no one cares. Everybody else has made so many friends, they've all gotten significant others, they've all found their niche, and I'm just here. I am just so, deeply sad. I just don't know what to do anymore."
Can you be depressed and not suicidal?,"I know its probably a stupid question but I really dont know.

Ive had symptoms of depression for a long time, and ive moticed them because friends of mine have been diagnosed for the same things but my friends have all had suicidal ideations at one point or another so I have this mental wall in my head that I cant ask for help because im not really depressed unless im suicidal too.

Is it worth me going to the doctors and seeing what they can do or will they really just not do anything unless im a risk to myself like ive read online?"
I just want a hug.,"I'm 16, male, and I have no idea where I'm going.

Everyone around me wants to do something with their lives, they have their shit figured out, and they know where they want to go and what they want to do. I have no clue.

I've taken test after test trying to figure out where I'm supposed to be, but nothing fits. All I want to do is sit down and rest. 

I spend 99% of my time doing *stuff*. I'm on a competitive rowing team, I'm a straight A student, and I'm finishing up my Eagle Scout rank. All of this work, and I feel like nothing is coming out of it. I feel empty.

I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I feel lost. 

And that's only half of my issue. 

I just want to be hugged, I want someone to cuddle and talk with, but nobody's there. I want to feel like I matter to someone other than my family, I want to share my life with someone. But I can't do that. Not at this age. 

I'm just so mad about it, I feel like crying and giving up on all of it, but I know that would only make it worse.

I'm just tired of the waiting. I wish time would move faster. I wish I could figure it all out. I wish I had someone to love.

And I know it only gets worse. I can't see myself living past 20. I can't even visualize it. I'll be lucky if I get that far.

Thanks for listening, and have a nice day.

EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone who responded. It really means a lot to me that you random people would reach out to me and let me know it's all gonna be alright. You guys have helped me look at my situation a little bit differently, and though it'll be tough, I think I can make it. Again, thank you all so much and I wish you the best on your own paths."
Does anyone else experience an ‚ÄúItching Soul‚Äù symptom?,"When my anxiety and depression is really bad I have this strange sensation that I can‚Äôt quite describe. It‚Äôs like experiencing the emotional part of having an itch - though nothing actually itches, and nothing to scratch to relieve it. I call it an itchy soul. Does anyone else know what I‚Äôm talking about?"
I'm really fucking sad,"I'm 22 M, it's Christmas day evening I feel fucking miserable I want to sleep and not wake up. I realize it's pretty depressing for Christmas but I feel I had to tell someone."
I feel like no one will take me seriously because I‚Äôm not suicidal.,"A little backstory:
I‚Äôm 16 years old and have clinical depression and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). I also might have OCD. Both my parents have chronic illnesses that made high school difficult, so I put in a lot of work and graduated early. In this process I lost most of my friends and I now have nothing to do with my time. I was struggling when I was in school, but it was at least a distraction. 

Now after several failed attempts at trying medications prescribed by my gp I‚Äôm waiting to see a psychiatrist for a med change. I‚Äôm also not in therapy anymore because my therapist left to join another field of work. 

I feel so helpless and alone and I anguish in the pain of my anxiety ridden mind every second of every day. But it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been put in limbo. Just waiting for the next appointment, where they‚Äôll refer me to someone else who I‚Äôll have to wait another month to see. 
 
All of this waiting is because I‚Äôm terrified of dying or getting hurt so I could never self harm or be suicidal. This makes people not see me as a priority. But I need help and I need it now. I feel like I lose my mind a little more everyday. I feel lost in self loathing and disappointment because I can never do what I want or need to do. And I‚Äôm so very exhausted. I lay awake at night scared of everything from inadvertently starting a fire and killing my family, to being killed by a home intruder. I can‚Äôt take it anymore but still I have to wait just because I‚Äôm not ‚Äúa threat to myself or others‚Äù. 

Anyone else feel the same? Cause I feel like I‚Äôm alone on this."
Depression is NOT a Facebook feeling word,I am worried that some people are using confusing the feeling word ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù because they‚Äôve had bad couple of weeks with the actual illness depression ?
Emotional Eating,I noticed that over the past 2 years I‚Äôve gained a lot of weight from eating my feelings. It‚Äôs like I go to food as a coping mechanism for when I feel bad. I was wondering if anyone had any solutions to emotional eating.
I absolutely despise myself. How do I not?," I'm terrible at everything I try. Everything I want to be good at I fuck up. I can barely cope with my (fantastic) job. I have absolutely no luck with women and am incredibly, insanely lonely as a result. I can't do anything I want to do because I know it won't be good enough.

How do I \[30M\] not feel this way? How do I not compare myself to others? How do I be good at things that I want to be good at? How do I not hate myself? This is all I've ever known."
"I feel like this stage of ""I guess I'll just have to power through it"" has been going on my entire life. Life doesn't feel worth living if I'm constantly having to work to get through it.","I have suffered from anxiety/depression my entire life. My depression has gotten so bad the past couple years. I lost every single one of my friends, no longer have the support of certain family members, my co-workers hate me, and my physical health is lacking. I don't drive, still live with parents, and only work 4hour shifts 4 days a week. I'm in my early 20s.

Since February of this year, I have been so fixated on the idea of taking my own life, but I know that I'm just getting my hopes up with the idea of having some kind of control, I would never be able to go through with doing it as I'm afraid of the pain.

I started seeing my old therapist again a couple months ago, and though it is nice to have someone to talk to that will give me advice, I feel that I'm just a lost cause. I understand therapy is a slow process but I am descending faster than I ever have before. I told him I was open to getting on medication, I was supposed to see a psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and be prescribed medication but my mom refuses to take me. She thinks that giving me some of her anxiety medication would work but I've tried it before back in HS and it just made me gain weight and feel like more of a piece of shit.

So all I can do now is wallow in my own self-pity and loneliness until I waste away into nothing or finally grow the ladyballs and take my life. I'm tired of telling myself that I'm just gonna have to power through it because I have been trying to power through this lowest pit of depression I've ever been in for over 2 years and nothing has worked. Weed is only a temporary release and it's always 50/50 on whether or not it'll make me feel even worse when I'm high plus it slows me down and has been making me more depressed long-term. I went through a sexual phase because any kind of affection made me feel better for a little while, now everyone knows me as an ugly sad hoe.

I don't even know why I typed all this out. I'm just done, honestly. I'm done trying. I shouldn't have to struggle just to wake up every day."
Do anyone feel like they are drowning and no one can hear them?," If you need someone to hear you out and need a shoulder to cry on, my PM is always open and I'm always here to talk to everyone. I want to help out as many people as I can and let everyone know that they are worth it. Please don't hesitate to text me during whatever time, I will always respond as fast as I can to all of you. You are loved, you are wanted, and you are all going to have the best future possible!! I hope you guys have a great weekend and an amazing Friday! :)"
"Fantasy brings me much more pleasure than reality, so how can I enjoy life again?","I've been struggling with depression for +10 years, and I'm at a point where I'm ready to just throw my hands up, and give up trying to find joy in the real world anymore. I've always turned to some form of escapism as a coping strategy, whether it's gaming, cartoons, or even just watching random YT videos. Now, I feel like I would just be happier if I could live in that escapism all the time. If there was a way I could just spend my life sleeping and dreaming all the time, I would.

Even my therapist has acknowledged that life won't be as much fun as living in a gaming world or watching cartoons, so what's the point? So far, the main answer seems to be ""you just have to do it."" I don't wanna die, but I don't wanna live either. I'm convinced nothing would make me happier than if I were to live in my own head.

Edit: I‚Äôm also on the autism spectrum, so I‚Äôve always had a harder time making friends, and interacting with people."

Will my depression ever just go away? I am just so tired of emotional pain.,"I am tired of thinking about death everyday and wanting to die. I am tired if thoughts like ""Is death peaceful?"".

I know how I will do it, I just don't know when or if I will do it."
I fucking hate high school,I don‚Äôt belong here. I‚Äôm stuck in this shitty school where everyone is a racist asshole and the teachers are scrambling to keep it together. And I just have to sit and watch. I wanted that perfect HS experience but my fucking ‚Äúfriends‚Äù threw me in the dirt. Everyday I feel more alone and isolated. I just want to lie down and cry at the end of each day. People tell me college will be better but I don‚Äôt know for sure anymore
I ate healthy stuff!,"Okay so this is going to sound ridicolous, but I'm really bummed about exams and university and the past month has been hell and I might drop out or just miss a semester or two. And I need to acknowledge this.

I have issues with comfort eating, and since I've stopped taking dance classes and everything basically I'm a bit over normal weight now. But weight is not really the issue; usually I can't be bothered to make an effort for my food. I eat way too many meals that just look like: bread, butter, cheese, mayo. (Yeah, mayo, I know.....) I just can't be bothered. But anyway I just watched *The Terror* yesterday, and now there's this little voice in my head all day that keeps going ""FRUITS VEGETABLES FRUITS VEGETABLES FRUITS VEGETABLES"" lol. And I ate an apple yesterday, and put lemon juice in my tea, and I just made myself a freaking salad. And I'm...proud, even if it's not much."
Why can't depression ever be gone forever?,"Hi, sorry i still dunno how reddit work yet. I just joined and it's  my first time talking about such stuff online. I've been diagnosed  with depression and few other stuff few years ago and i had treatement and such until i felt better but whenever i got into an argument with family i could feel it crawl back in me. Up until now I've  been strong enough to overcome those small situations. And even tho i feel better most of the time i can feel it whenever i'm sort of reverting back to it. Like i start to go out less and less, i stop talking to people online and irl and answering the phone becomes a hard task.. then i start to distract myself by bingewatching shows so i don't leave space to thinking, i don't/can't sleep at night and i have a hard time remembering things i just did or dont realize I've done them. And i like  reading but it becomes hard like i can't focus and i end up skipping lines or read without remembering/understanding what i just read. The more i stay home the harder it is to get out. Anyway that's how i know shit is getting serious. Other than that i sometimes have a hard time swallowing food the doctor said it was anxiety a lack of magnesium and having supplements did help but anyway. Two days ago came back home i was in a good mood i brought sweets for everyone at home except i fould out novody was there. I have a kitten at home i brought it recently about two months ago. it's  5 months old and it still pees in the wrong spots when it's  far from its litter. The past few weeks it peed 3 times on my blanket and i had to take it get cleaned everytime. I barely got to use it so this time i had put it in a closed room so the cat cant get to it. But a cousin of mine opened the room to feed the cat there and my father had taken away the litter out of the room because that's  what he does .. whatever he likes basically. Anyway when i came back i found the door open and pee on the blanket that i had just taken out of from cleaning a night before and put aside away from the cat but there it was dirty again. I got mad. And i couldn't get angry at anyone. I felt like even when i did my best to avoid something it happened again. And i burst crying pretty dramatically.. i felt devastated. I mean i know it's a ridiculous way to react but i went from good day to worst day ever for a stupud reason in no time and i couldn't  stop laughing for a while. I guess i felt frustrated or idk but i kept muttering stuff and couldn't  stop crying. And when i calmed down about half an hour later i was worried i had reacted this way before when i wasn't  feeling well but i didn't think id react that way now. I thought everything was fine. Now i just don't know if i really am. The only reason i can think of as the source is that I'll be taking classes again after almost a year now I've failed my last high school year twice in the past when my depression  was really bad and after that and therapy i felt good enough to study again i stopped highschool  i chose a different institute i studied for two years and my grades were good for the two years ive been studyingi passed the final exam but half way through the end year project i just gave up. I don't  know if i can blame my mental health for it or if i just turned into a self sabotaging  person or just that it wasnt what i really wanted to do bur i was driven by the fact that i dont have a choice so i just did it. After that i stayed out of school for about a year doing half time jobs and now i want to try something different again. I'm  afraid that's  the cause but i don't  want it to be i just wanna finish what i start this time. This thing is already going on for too long. I'm  not sure what I'm  asking you here. But i guess i want an opinion or advice. I'm worried i can't tell when I'm  not ok until symptoms get physical and how am i supposed to deal with that.. what if it affects how i deal with stuff negatively  and I'll  only be aware of it when it's  too late. Anyway.. thanks for reading until the end i appreciate it."
You guys make me feel less alone,"I know it may seem pathetic and there are so many other people like me on here but reading your guys posts I see that everyone else‚Äôs life is just as struggling as mine. I suffer from social anxiety and I‚Äôm bipolar. I‚Äôm quite young and I haven‚Äôt experienced much but all my life I‚Äôve felt different. I‚Äôve been picked on, looked at differently, and talked about. I have a couple of close friends but even then they make me feel bad about myself. I‚Äôm so used to it by now since it‚Äôs been happening all my life so it‚Äôs easy to just brush off. I just take everything in and ignore it and it works but sometimes it catches up to me. Looking here I realize that I‚Äôm not alone in my struggle so thank you guys for making me feel connected."
"I tried posting on r/depression, but I soon realized that was the worst place to go. I deleted my post and came here instead.","This is probably gonna be all over the place. I haven't been diagnosed with depression by a professional because I'm too terrified to tell my parents, but all the hallmark symptoms are there. General sadness, loss of interest, unmotivated, always tired, self-loathing, urges to self-harm, etc. 

&#x200B;

I'm 16, homeschooled (somehow managed to get incredibly behind, which adds to the depression), and I have no friends irl. I have online friends, and I trust them with just about anything. I've been half-tempted to give my address to one of them incase I end up doing something uh...rash, if you know what I mean. But anyways, they're good friends at heart, but a majority of them are absolutely AWFUL at helping. I don't blame them. This isn't something you can just slap a band-aid over. Most of the time they'd end up arguing, going something like:

  
""tim needs this""  
""no, he needs this instead""

""that wont help""  
""you don't know that""

&#x200B;

I eventually just...shut down for a few weeks. I didn't talk to anyone, I didn't interact with anyone, I was offline on multiple places. This caused my friends to get worried, and a few of them started some discord intervention group chat thing. I only know about it because one of my friends there actually understood what I meant, what I was talking about, etc. So he joined just to tell me what was going on. It ended up being an argument between two of my friends over what way to best help me. Despite the fact I told them about 40 times that I just wanna be listened to. Now, this was MONTHS ago, but it still frustrates me somehow. 

&#x200B;

I know I should tell my parents, I know I should get up and do something, I know it doesn't magically get better, but this immense amount of fear and anxiety prevents me from doing so. It doesn't help that my family constantly makes half-serious remarks such as: 

&#x200B;

""Tim you're no fun"", ""Tim, stop being boring"", ""Tim just hates fun"", etc. But they wonder why I don't wanna be around them. Its frustrating. Every time I try to do something, it seems to do absolutely nothing, or I just end up failing. I've tried getting out more, spending less time on my PC, etc. but at this point the only thing that could maybe help is a therapist, and I'm too terrified to say anything. At this point, theres only three things keeping me from jumping off a nearby bridge:   


1. Christianity. Say what you want, I don't care, but its one of the few things keeping me alive.

2. My friends. 

3. Causing my family the same pain I have. 

&#x200B;

Its infuriating knowing what I should do but being too scared to do it. My step-dad yells even when he doesn't mean to, he starts arguments over almost nothing, he can be sensitive, he's the biggest hypocrite I know, but at his core, he's a good person. My mom is too over-protective, she gets too worried and too panicky over everything. Before they let me move my PC to my room, any time I laughed anything, my mom would ask ""what are you laughing at"", ""what are you playing"", etc. Shes paranoid. And I don't like the idea of telling her about depression because of it. My step-dad is more relaxed when it comes to issues like this, but I'm afraid he'll just tell my mom, and I can't trust my siblings either. They'd all go to my parents despite what I say. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.   


My brain is always foggy, I can never think straight. I feel like I locked myself in my own brain. I don't like being edgy or depressing all the time but I can't help it anymore. My friends get worried if I make too many depression or suicide jokes. I'm getting sick and tired of waking up to self hatred, tiredness, and general sadness. I'm frustrated. I've been like this a full year already and I see that number increasing unless I either kill myself or actually get help. It doesn't matter how well my day goes or how bad it goes, I still hate myself and end up almost breaking down at the end of the day regardless. I'm just lucky I don't think I'm ugly I guess. I hate everything else about me, but my looks? Nah thats fine. Apparently.

TL;DR Big sad SUCKS. Thanks to anyone who bothers reading this"
I told my husband that I‚Äôm not okay,"I‚Äôve been having some really low moments lately and had a talk with my husband about some of it. He was really supportive when I said the words ‚Äú I am not okay‚Äù. He said he‚Äôd do everything he can to help , but made me promise I will try to get professional help as well. Later I apologized for losing it, and he said in all seriousness, to never apologize for that. He‚Äôs so good to me. I wish I could be whole for him. He‚Äôs my rock."
This is a cry for help...,"My story is a little bit long so I apologize for that.
I'm a step away from suicide. I've been dealing with depression for at least 19 months now, and everything sucks.

Hi there. I'm a 19 year old boy from Iran. First let me make it clear that I'm an atheist and this is story isn't from a religious perspective. But Iran has a religious culture and government which has affected this story.

I grew up lonely. My mother and father were never there for me. They just had a lot of expectations from me cause I was a smart-ass kid. But they never really cared about the pressure they put me through or my feelings.

I started dating when I was 18. Yeah, a year ago. How did I start dating? It was my last year in high school and I was studying the shit out of myself to get accepted in a great university. Just 5 months before the big test, I was so sick from the pressure. I needed someone. I needed someone to love, someone to love me. my family sucks. So I started dating this girl who was the same age I was. 


One thing I need to explain to you guys is that relationships in Iran are really different from Europe or USA. They proceed a lot faster. I know it's wrong. But it's part of the modern/religious culture that you live in.
For example you have to say ""I love you"" in the first month. Crazy, isn't it?
Also most relationships in iran don't include sex. Cause most people in iran believe that hymen test is scientific. 
And doctors are making money of this myth. Fuck.


So I started dating her and we dated for 2 months. I became extremely obsessed with her. I loved her so much. Please don't judge me for that. It was my first serious relationship and I completely fell in love.
She told me the same.
But after 2 months she told me that she can't get her ex out of her mind and broke up with me. Making me realize I was just a rebound. 

I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldn't love them and I still wanted that specific girl.

I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. 
How did that happen?

8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. 
A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. 
I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs (atheist) and her style and her face. She was kinda ""the one"". As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as ""Jane"". And, I refer to myself ""Jack"".

I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off.
I reached one of my girl-friends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20.
That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didn't care.

I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited.



But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her: ""did Jack say anything about me to you?""
She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that ""Jack is into Jane"".

She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too.

I couldn't believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too? 
I spent a week chatting with Jane on Instagram. She was absolutely amazing. 

So, sick of depression and everything, I took a leap of faith. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown. 
A few days later, I heard jane broke up with that asshole because of me. 
I started dating her and we dated for 2 months.

Finally, I was happy after a long time. I was living in heaven. She was so perfect that I was finally happy for a short time in my entire fucking life. I totally forgot about my ex girlfriend and fell in love with Jane.

Note: Jane is one month older than me.

I lost my virginity to her. We had sex for 3 times when we were dating. So I became kinda attached to her, you know?
I loved her and she loved me sooo much. We couldn't get enough of each other.
Something to add, she was extremely jealous. I thought that was really cute and adorable cause it shows that she cared for me but, our relationship got toxic.
She fought with me a few times about those 3 girls I dated in the past! I explained to her that they meant nothing to me and our fights ended with her saying ""I love you""

One night she told me she loved me so much. But if she sees that I'm flirting with other girls and stuff, she will breakup with me cause she can't tolerate that. I kissed her and told her that there is nothing she needs to worry about.

And I meant it.
I was 100% loyal and honest to her. 
But one time one of my friends (girl) from my ex-college  commented on one of my Instagram posts ""miss you"".
The next day, I realized Jane flirt flirted with a few guys. 
I asked her what the fuck was going on, and she said I started it.
I was heartbroken, told her that was a misunderstanding, and she apologized, which I accepted.
But, I was heartbroken cause I couldn't believe Jane wasn't loyal and committed to me.

One night, she told me that she's scared cause she feels like she is one of those girls who meant nothing to me. I told her she was insane and I'm in love with her.
 
Until one day when we were at one of my friends house and we were alone, I started making love to her. we didn't have much time so she got pissed off and told me that I was so selfish and I just wanted her for sex and left.

This led to our breakup. The next few days we fought and she started flirting with other guys.
I couldn't believe everything was falling apart. 

She told me that she loved me so much but she thinks that I don't love her so her love for me has faded away.
She told me that her personality makes her want to date older guys and I've been acting like a kid.

Break: can you believe age is this much important for girls in Iran? Well you can't blame them cause they have a lot of father issues,  but I really didn't expect it from Jane.

I couldn't believe what I heard. I was totally mature and loyal and honest about our relationship and the person who was acting like a kid was Jane the whole fucking time. But I got accused of ""acting like a kid"".

We broke up and she blocked me on everything. It's been 3 months since we broke up and it happened in the worst possible time.
I couldn't hangout with my friends to ease the pain cause of quarantine. I was lonely the whole time.

After quarantine was finished in Iran, I started hanging out with my friends and stuff but there is still a crushing pain deep down in my chest.

And you wanna know something funny? I heard she got back together with that asshole who treated her like shit.

Obviously knowing that she is this much immature made me realize I don't love her anymore. 
But I still miss that feeling. I miss being happy in a relationship. I miss being in love.

I've been seeing a therapist since we broke up and she helped me to ease the pain a lot but, I'm still extremely depressed. 

I can't study, I can't workout, my appetite is fucked up, my sleep schedule is fucked up, I can't enjoy anything. 

I want to be happy again. I want to enjoy being single. I want to put my career and studies above my dating life but I just fucking can't cause it seems like I'm still seeking for the love and attention that my parents never gave me.

Please help me. 
Save me from this living hell."
Anyone else hate CBT?,"I can't stand it. I can't stand having ""homework"" to do. I can't stand having to do worksheets.

I hate mindfulness. I hate it all.

It makes me feel like I'm being treated like a child. But there doesn't seem to be anything else. 

I see a therapist and we talk. But I can't get help online or anywhere else between sessions because they're all worksheets and brain exercises and mindfulness. I hate it all so much. Even when I'm not depressed I can't stand it.

Anyone else the same? What else do you do?"
Massive weight off my shoulders - Opening up about suicidal thoughts,"24F here :)
Disclaimer I'm not the most coherent person and I tend to ramble. Not sure if this fits in this sub I also posted to r/AnxietyDepression) 
 
So I've suffered with crippling anxiety since the age of 12 when my dad passed in quite a traumatic way for me. I've been through therapy/on meds for years and about a year ago I was feeling much less depressed and anxious and came off my meds yay!! 

A few months ago, I lost my job and it was a massive blow to my confidence. Ive slipped back into a depression and never want to leave the house and am constantly arguing with my boyfriend (massive social butterfly) because I don't want anyone at the house and I just lock myself in the bathroom and cry all the time. Obviously arguing has been making it worse as I feel like I'm losing him aswell as my mind.
Hes very kind but generally not the most sympathetic as he leads a very fast paced life and has been through a hell of a lot and his way to deal with his issues is the opposite to me lol.

The past month my heads been full of suicidal thoughts, I think about killing myself most of the day, every day. Like even if we are sitting watching TV I'll be looking round the room planning ways I could do it (even though I probably wouldn't). Last night my boyfriend got really frustrated with me because he noticed I'd been self harming (when I do this I don't usually even remember It really and am always so embarrassed by it as soon as I realise-do other people get this??) and I shouted something about how I just wanted to die but I just couldn't leave him on his own and he looked absolutely heartbroken just cuddled me for ages. We had an amazing talk and he was the first person I've EVER told about being suicidal (not even my therapist). I feel like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I can't stop crying, even now (in a good way) and I wish I had said something so much sooner. I also not believe that someone can love me unconditionally for who I am and that's really special. 

Our relationship already feels so much more back on track and even though I'm still sad, I really feel like I've accomplished something and feel very blessed to have such an amazing man in my life.

I guess I don't have too much of a point here. I just feel like I've really accomplished something and made a massive step in both my mental health and my relationship and wanted to share with someone. :)"
How do you convince yourself doing the things you don't like doing?,"I don't get it. What should I think about when laying in bed but I have to hit the gym?

How can I convince myself to do those things even if I have no motivation to do them?"
I cant stop thinking about killing myself,"I cant stop thinking about either blowing my head off or crashing my car into traffic. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll actually do it since i have have think of my family dealing with it but i can‚Äôt get these thoughts out of my head, they won‚Äôt go away it‚Äôs literally 24hrs a day , the anxiety is crippling, i feel alone and unwanted & i try to hard to be normal but sometimes i break and people reject me. I have to always pretend to be strong for my family since they rely on me so much but it hurts to feel this way all the time"
Something a lot of you don‚Äôt get told very often,"Something a lot of you don‚Äôt get told very 
often:
I love you. And I do. I love every single one of you. Yes I may not know any of y‚Äôall but I still love each and every one of you. You know why? Because you are all beautiful and wonderful people. You may feel like nobody cares about you but that isn‚Äôt true whatsoever. You‚Äôve helped me immensely. If y‚Äôall weren‚Äôt here some off us would be worse off than we are now. You may not see the will in fighting or pushing on. But I‚Äôm telling you, there will be something in your future that will push everything away. I believe in you. So I want you to believe and love yourself. Because if a random person off the internet can love you, you can love yourself as well."
To whoever needs to hear this: It will get better!,"About a year ago, I was feeling  very down. I've struggled with depression for most of my adult life. I posted a depressive post here and got a few replies from people trying to cheer me up which didnt do much. However, things did eventually start getting better. Some by chance others by decision. If you are feeling low. Trust the process and life cycles of ups and downs. It's not always your fault but you do have a choice in your future. As humans we are fine tuned machines but things can get out of line in our brains or our surroundings causing depression. Its important to keep going forward even if its just baby steps or taking breaks when necessary. Learn to practice self love."
Am I the only one who gets more depressed in the summer?,"I've always suffered from depression regardless of the seasons, and I know most people's depression seems to worsen during the winter months, but for some reason, for me it's the opposite. I get SO depressed in the summer, I don't know what it is...maybe seeing everyone out enjoying themselves just makes my own inner misery that much darker. Today's the first day of summer and I'm just dreading making it through :( I realize how weird this probably sounds"
Abusive father in quarantine. What exactly am I supposed to do about it,"I usually just leave or go somewhere if he flips his shit, or at the very least I go the next day or that weekend. I've been trapped in my house for three weeks now and I've been screamed at and threatened on a virtually daily basis save for a few lucky days. I'm really losing my will to try at this point. I feel like my whole body is revolting against the idea of living here in quarantine for much longer. What the fuck do I do about it

Just an edit: thank you all for your advice and support. It means the world to me that anyone cares at all. Thanks for shining a little bit of light on my life in these dark times. It makes me feel a little less alone in it all."
Does anyone else 'self harm' with music?,"Sorry for the title, I don't mean to trigger anyone with the terms I used, but I feel it kinda fits with my behaviour and the reasoning..

&#x200B;

I have a long list of artists I can't listen to because they make me irrationally emotional, but once a month or so, I'll crack out the sad tunes and basically, purposefully let the music kill me internally. It's like I want to be overwhelmed with sadness and this is the easiest way to do it without the obvious actual self harming techniques.

Its like.... once I've had the massive cry and release of emotion, I'm halfway back to being me again.

EDIT: Thanks so much for the replies everyone. Its really nice to know this is actually something that seems reasonably common!

How in the actual heck does one love themselves,"I have a very bad problem in that the only way to love myself is that I receive love from other people (a potential girlfriend). This is apparently very unhealthy and self destructive. Problem is, that is all I know about how to love myself. I have been told to love myself but I find that VERY difficult to do. I was raised in a household with a mother who was infuriated and enraged with seemingly small things and took things way too far pretty frequently. She took a lot of her anger out on my father and she did so in plain sight of me and my sister. Her use of pure hatred and rage towards my father rubbed off onto me. The difference is, that unlike her, I have the common decency to keep all this inside my head. A lot is directed towards the outer world and a lot is directed towards myself. I cant love myself, because the only two things I feel for myself are hatred and rage, so I look to unspoiled minds for affection. I know this is self destructive and it will just push me closer to pulling the trigger or jumping off the cliff, I know that. 

&#x200B;

I am looking for real, tangible, practical and usable advice for how to love oneself. The only advice I have received so far is    that, ""You should love yourself."" Great, what the heck does that mean? I have received advice like, ""Engage in your hobbies and court yourself."" Well I already have hobbies and I do nice things every once and a while, no effect there. Plus, I don't have much time to engage in hobbies since I am a college student and despite having some money in the bank, I need to make more this summer. 

&#x200B;

If you have any advice, it would be greatly appreciated."
"I've been thinking about dying, not suicide, but finding another way to just die.","Hi, my name is Danielk, I will give you a quick summary of what's been going on.

A couple of years ago I was married and with a child, long story short, my wife was cheating with one of my best friends at the time, I found out that my daughter was his, and I went through depression as best as I possibly could, never had therapy of any sort though.

Back then I thought of killing myself, but never got the courage to do so.

Fast forward to january this year, I broke up with my girlfriend after three years of relationship, it wasn't anything messy, it was mostly that both of us are busy ( we are both working and in college) and decided it was best for us to split at the moment, we broke up in good terms.

Yet for the past few weeks I've been feeling really down, I don't eat much, I can barely sleep, and the thought of just dying has been in my mind constantly. 

I'm having a hard time understanding myself, this isn't even close to what happened before, but somehow, I feel the same or even worse. I don't want to kill myself, just die, like getting mugged or ran over by a bus or something. I've been engaging in dangerous practices, I walk out at night on shitty neighborhoods looking for something to happen, I just don't think I have energy to do anything anymore.

any advice? I feel this might be some strange case of ptsd, I dunno, I'm open to suggestions, and I am already looking for a therapist.

Thanks for your taking your time to read."
Pushing through,"Hello,

After 2.5 days in bed, scared to get out from under the quilt, I got up yesterday. I had a package delivered - 80 plug plants I ordered weeks ago. I really didn't want to but I made myself get up and plant those little feckers. I knew that leaving them in a box in my kitchen would have justified my usual brain set - look, they've died, what a stupid idea to get them in the first place, throw them away, everything is spoiled, metaphor for my life.... 

I spent two hours planting them in tubs and pots. Who knows if all of them will survive? Who knows what they will look like if they do? (I've no idea what they are, lucky dip purchase) What I do know is that I'm glad they are done, I'm glad I got out of bed, I'm glad I didn't let them die. If any survive and actually flower I'll post a picture to show that a little bit of effort makes a difference later! 

I don't care if a small, insignificant thing like this is something millions of people do every day. It's big for me. Be OK everyone, plant something! "

"""Why cant I enjoy fun things I used to love?"" (HERE'S WHY)","So I feel like this is an issue that is mentioned a lot. The reason why, is not going to be encouraging, but at least an explanation. I asked my therepist this and this is what he said (he is really good at stepping into his patients shoes); 

""Picture this. You are depressed. You feel almost nothing and you cant control it. Things that made you happy, you can not feel anymore. But you know what it felt like, you have felt it before; and you shame yourself for not feeling it anymore. So you know it exists and remember the feeling. So you go to a carnival with a friend. The lights dont sparkle like they used to. You dont want to do anything but your friend persists. You begin to cry. Your friend asks whats wrong. You say 'im trying to enjoy this, but I cant feel the joy no matter how hard I try. Being here is torture, because I am looking at what I love and cant feel it. Its making me miserable and sad that I cant feel the joy and the love. Please take me home' "". 

Its okay if you cant feel certain emotions right now. But it is not forever, and YOU WILL FEEL AGAIN. Everyone has their journey. But its ok to express whats going on with you. Its ok to have this emotion roller coaster. You are ok. And this is not forever."

Why do strangers care if another stranger wants to kill themselves?,"I've been wondering about this too for the longest time. Why does it matter if me, a stranger on the internet, wants to kill myself? I mean it doesn't affect anyone else's life. My existence has no impact on anyone, so why does it matter if I were to just end everything? I'm asking more in general though, why do we care for other people and their well-being? What drives us to want others to not die.

Low energy things that can boost your mood,"I thought it'd be nice to post some non-strenuous things that keep me going when I'm feeling really down. Idk about anyone else but I find sometimes that doing or achieving something small can give me a boost to do harder things like laundry, showering, cleaning etc. Comment your own!

- changing an item of clothing like socks, underwear, t shirt etc
- washing my face or brushing my teeth
- flicking through a non fiction book and reading the captions on the pictures
- feeding my goldfish (her name is debbie ocean and I love her dearly) 
- free line doodling - draw a continuous line and try to fill up the page
- sorting out your wallet/purse (it's so satisfying when it's flat again) 
- making a drink that's a little bit more effort than just tap water, like cordial, milkshake, or even just putting ice in a cold drink 
- emptying a waste paper basket into the outside bins
- watching an episode of a show you like but haven't watched in a long time (be careful not to binge though)
- messaging a friend an inside joke
- finding something sortable and sorting it like stacks of coins, mail etc - for me it's my scarves
- cleaning your glasses/phone properly "

I almost died a year ago and now I‚Äôm about to graduate year early and go to college,"March 26 2018 I was diagnosed with MDD aka major depressive disorder aka clinical depression. I was in student government, ap classes, had a awesome group of friends, and just came back from state for DECA. This diagnose came after me starting to skip school and not wanting to get up in the morning. Naturally I started therapy and would go once a week during lunch. April rolled around and my depression was progressively getting worse. It all came to a head when I wasn‚Äôt allowed to run for student government next year and that night, April 18th 2018 I overdosed on several different medications that belonged to my 89 year old great grandfather and mixed it with NyQuil. I laid backed and closed my eyes hoping to die in my sleep but then I had a dream where I died and everyone I knew wasn‚Äôt the same next thing I know I wake up in a hospital with my great-grandfather wiping his tears away and I knew what the universe was trying to tell me. So eventually I continue therapy and fail second semester of sophomore year because I knew school wasn‚Äôt for me. I spend the summer with friends and try and get back into the grove of things. Fast forward to October and for DECA there was a fall conference that I was really excited to go to and I knew would help put me on track. I was denied because my ‚Äúpenmanship showed I didn‚Äôt care.‚Äù I again felt so defeated and started skipping school. My friends wouldn‚Äôt try and be understanding this time and told me to get my shit together and drop me. My grades where dropping and I was just feeling like killing myself again. This time around I knew better so I started to have sex, drink, smoke, party to distract myself from the pain. I got stuck on a island (I live on the west side of WA), would come home @3am a lot, sneak guys who were 18+ and I was 16 at the time and would overall put myself into a lot of danger. During this rebellion I found this app called Yubo and for the next few months I made some amazing friends, got into a lot of drama, and this helped meet my social needs to a certain extent. Also during this time I switched to online school. I eventually was banned off Yubo because of ‚Äúthreatening behavior.‚Äù But the app is trash and toxic and only gave me a small group of people that I still talk to to this day. All of my ‚Äúproblems‚Äù seemed to go away once I deleted the app and the day after my 17th birthday I got myself a puppy. Now I‚Äôm going back to my seasonal job at Nordstrom and I‚Äôm only a few credits away from graduating high school a year early. I started off on the top, hit ROCK bottom TWICE, but with the help of therapy, support, Prozac, and honestly going through a rebellious stage I‚Äôm in a happy place in my life and it is all thanks to my ex-friends, and the two teachers who hated me for putting me on a path that will lead me to making 6 figures a year by the time in my mid 20‚Äôs debt free while they all are dealing with crippling debt<3. Just remember you have to start somewhere. This journey is gonna have some set backs, a lot of bumps in the road, but you will FIGURE THIS OUT AND BE HAPPY! I PROMISEüíó"

Admitted to myself today thay I need help,"Tried searching for a therapist online today but couldn't find anything locally and broke down. I have been struggling with depression my whole life but always set my feelings aside for the sake of my family... or self medicated with alcohol and weed. 

I recently found out that I am pregnant and stopped smoking cigs, weed and drinking... I live 2 hours away from my family and I just feel so hopeless... My significant other has been great with everything since we found out about the baby, doing everything around the house, feeding me... I can't find joy in anything anymore and I don't know what to do... I can't even get out of bed or off the couch unless it's for work. 

I have my first appointment with my OB tomorrow so I plan on talking with her about how I feel as long as I don't chicken out... 

I guess I just needed to get this all off my chest to someone who wasn't going to judge me.  It felt good just typing this out as I have never admitted this to myself seriously before. Thank you for listening.

Update: 
Thank you all for your kindness, advice and support. I almost deleted my post after I typed it, but I am so relieved that I didn't. I have a habit of hiding my feelings, so it was difficult to even share this about myself anonymously. Your support and validation gives me hope ‚ô°."
No one remember my birthday,"I have been living closed for 5 years and i have always turned off my birthday because i really shy when it come to my birthday.People keep asking me what will i do on my birthday but in reality it just like all my normal day. But this year i finally come out of my shell. Im trying my best for my goal. Today i left my birthday turn on, but i waited all day not even a single happy birthday wish posted on my facebook,maybe they dont remember me at all. I'm just sad when realize after all these time isolated myself that i am nobody. I just want to share my story here with you guys.

I'm sorry this might  not be the subreddit for the sad one like me but i couldnt find a place to share with someone"
Reached out to my doctor because my mental health is really bad right now but the earliest appointment I could get was a month from now,Everyday is so miserable. I'm so horribly self deprecating and hopeless that I'm not okay unless I'm rewatching a funny show that I like. I've been watching it for three weeks and the world keeps getting worse and making life feel even more pointless and horrible. What can I do to help myself for the next month before I can meet with someone about finding a new medication and a therapist?
My cat went missing and I need advice on how to cope.,"In my previous post I mentioned my cat went missing and I can't really go look for her due to lockdown regulations in my country being so strict that I can't even walk in the street (I live in South Africa) . Right now it looks like she's not coming back but i am hoping she will.

I have struggled with anxiety and depression for years and I am finding it impossible to cope with losing my other cat. My previous cat went missing last year around the same time but at least back then I could look for her and hand out flyers. This cat was my baby and I raised her. She always comforted me when I was sad and was an overall sweetheart. It's like there's a void in my house where she used to be (if that makes sense) 

I am so depressed I can't even get out of bed. Is there anything I can do that will help me cope with this? Because I am just so heartbroken and I can see its taking a toll on the people around me as well.

Edit: My goodness I didn't think this post would blow up like it did. I just want to say thank you everyone for the support and advice. I am so grateful for all the helpful tips I got and the support. Still no sign of my cat but I will keep everyone updated."
"My boyfriend had recently self harmed, and this has triggered me","The entire time my 24yo boyfriend and I (21F) have been together, he has always suffered with depression and anxiety. He has his good periods and bad periods, and I learnt how to deal with both. He‚Äôs off anti depressants, and hasn‚Äôt been to therapy in a while. Until a few days ago, he‚Äôs only ever told me about his urges, but has never actually self harmed. Then one morning, he told me he had cut himself, and how he was sorry and was really ashamed he had done it. I was supportive towards him, let him cry, and made sure he was okay. But after I had dealt with this, the thoughts of self harm seem to have become more frequent in my head. I have dealt with recurrent self harm thoughts in the past, but I haven‚Äôt suffered with them recently. I hope that I never act on these, but if I did I fear that he would blame himself, or think that I acted out to be like him. I‚Äôm just confused."
I got up and went out for some sunlight today :),It's mostly cold and damp or gloomy. But today it was sunny and when it's sunny it is a great feeling. So I decided to get out of my house and not stay couped up and just get some sunshine. We all hear that sunlight is important to feeling better when it comes to depression but try to ignore the science explanation we're all given and just imagine or feel the sunlight hit your body and how good it feels. I hope you all have a great day and hopefully get some sunshine :).
My mother just told me she's depressed,"This morning, my mother finally told me why she hasn't been working in the past two months and half. She suffers from clinical depression, which causes her job as a medical doctor to be too overwhelming for her. I told her she should see a psychiatrist about that, and she responded that she is already seeing one and that she's taking meds to help her. She said she wanted to tell me because she knew I was really worried about her and why she hasn't been to work in the past months. Indeed, I was thinking that something was horribly wrong and she was dying or something like that. I am 18 years old and I dealt with depression last year. I didn't even realise that that was depression until my mom had me meet a psychiatrist who finally determined that I was depressed. Anyway, with proper medication, I overcame it and got much better, but I spent so many days and nights feeling extremely miserable. Thinking that my mother could be feeling that way breaks my heart. 
Unfortunately, that's not all she's dealing with. Her father died last week. My parents flew overseas to see him when his state was critical, but they refused that I come because I have school. Merely writing this, as his grandson, brings tears to my eyes. I've spent most of my days and nights since his death crying, but I cannot imagine how my mom feels. I haven't seen her cry, but it would be extremely typical of her to hide her woe if she thought that it would pain me to see her suffer.
I suspect she's at the lowest point of her life, having to deal with clinical depression and then the death of her father, but I don't know how to help her get through this, which is why I need advice."
Things are finally starting to look up,"I finally took the plunge and I'm now on meds. Escitalopram to be exact. This is the best decision I ever could have made! If this is what it feels like to be normal, then I like normal. I'm not crying every night and I actually got out of bed this morning. I feel level. Kind of like a calm lake instead of my normal raging sea. It feels so good just to be balanced and able to function without a grey cloud sapping my emotions and making me unable to do anything. I can see light at the end of the tunnel and I'm enjoying finally feeling okay. I have had depression since I was about 8 and I became suicidal at age 10. After all these years, I am finally starting to be okay again. Sorry for the long post, I just felt like I had to share with someone who would understand. I know meds aren't for everyone and I'm in no way trying to push them on you guys, but they have helped me so much and I finally feel at peace."
I feel numb [NSFW],"An acquaintance of mine recently committed suicide. He took some edibles and alcohol and drove the opposite way into traffic after recording a suicide note and sending it to everyone on Snapchat. I didn't know him that well but he was a good guy. All my friends loved him, my girlfriend loved him. I loved him too, I would've been there for him. I see myself in him almost. I feel guilty. I can't cry though I just feel numb. I feel horrible."
Almost killed myself a few weeks ago so I quit my meds and tried to make personal changes but I just feel miserable all the time.,"I‚Äôm fine I think  I just put a gun to my head which caused me to loose faith in my meds which I promptly quit. I just want to feel normal but I always feel sad instead depression is such a bitch.

Edit. Thanks for the kind words I wish I could say I was feeling better but that‚Äôs never the case lol. Thanks though it does help."
Can I still win at life?,I'm 24f and am just so sad about what my life has become. I just got out of a 2 1/2 year relationship and still havent finished my degree. I just feel so low and worthless...like I'll never be happy or fulfilled. I have no friends no job and no hobbies. Just really tired of life.
My girlfriend said she found somebody new.,"I don't know where I went wrong. I gave her all I had, and she says she found somebody. Not better, but she says that we are over. I do not know what to do"
The outside world is ugly and depressing yet people mock me for trying to escape.,"My family is toxic and abusive. I have 0 friends and I can't make any due to my social deficits and anxiety. Going outside is pointless, because the streets are ugly and filled with dog shit and I need to breath through my mouth for most of the way. Trying to start a conversation with anyone is pointless because most of the people around here are elderly, extremely conservative, and annoying and will make it clear that their frontal lobe is deteriorating with age. Besides that, there's a lot of foreign people around that don't know English, and I never even got along with the native population because of conflicting values and being nearly unable to communicate in the native language. Cue misunderstandings, people being very annoyed with me and looking at me in suspicion because of that.

I cannot escape into the countryside because we barely have any left, and what is left is filled with rubbish, criminal hunters, and yet more dog shit. At least maybe if I lived somewhere like Germany or Sweden, I'd think how if I killed myself I wouldn't get to experience all that beautiful nature.

And I find it absolutely maddening how people chastise me for trying to isolate myself from the world. The environment around me is objectively, fucking ugly. And the only way I can deal with it is by spending time in the virtual world; video games, forums, writing. It's literally been my life support for years. It only barely keeps me alive, but if I didn't have it I'd be doing some worse things to escape, or I'd just kill myself."
My mom told me I ruined the day,I wasn't planning to feel depressed today Mom. I'm so sorry that it inconvenienced you.
I have been flossing my teeth every day!,"I have some sort of mental block with brushing my teeth and flossing afterwards. My therapist says that self-care is difficult because you don't believe you are worth looking after, so you don't invest in yourself. It is hard to stand still and stare at myself for those minutes, but I have been doing it!"
To those who are suffering today,"To those who are suffering today, suffered yesterday,  or fear they suffer in the future: you matter.  Your life is important and needed, even when it doesn't seem like it.  You are a beautifully complicated creature with depth and perception that matches that of the deepest ocean.  You are once of the soldiers, strong enough to fight the Good fight. 

You are loved and you matter."
Teenage Daughter Cutting.,"I'm writing here because we still have another month before she can get into the psychiatrist. I just need help. They didn't want to hold her for 72 hours, yet I get no sleep worrying. She says she doesn't know why she is sad and angry. I have battled depression for 15 years due to not being medicated for postpartum, but her mental health is much more important to me. Asking for recommendations for coping mechanisms that have worked for your situation. Today she had a bad day. They are seeming to get worse. Any recommendations would be very very appreciated."
I literally cut off all my friends,"I cut off most of my friends due to anxiety and trauma and depression, among thinking they'd  dislike my boyfriend. Now during the pandemic, I realize how idiotic I was to do that and now idk how to make new friends üò≠ help"
Are you honest with your friends about your depression?,"I‚Äôm a 28yo F, and I have severe depression since 2012. 
My crisis unfortunately occur quite regularly (once an year or once every 1 and a half year). 

But since my first crisis I told me friend that I wouldn‚Äôt give them attention, I wouldn‚Äôt go out with them, I would avoid social media and texting. 

I explained everything the best I could, how I felt, how hard it was to keep contact and how it felt like a task/burden during my crisis. 

That maybe during the crisis I would need their help and it would seem selfish being absent for long periods os time and appear to ask for help without asking  about them. But it is what I can offer at the moment, and that when I‚Äôm out of a crisis I would treat our friendship normally again. 

Did I lose any friends? Sure, but it‚Äôs the life, some people can‚Äôt deal with this, but a lot of people can... you would be really surprised. 



I have a lot of friends for my age. 4 friends that I know that would do anything for me, even take me to their home if I end up homeless. With them I can share about the ugliest parts of my depression if I want to... 

I also told them that it‚Äôs ok for them to not know what to say or how to help when I tell them the ugly stuff,  I go to a psychologist every week and she can help me with that. I just tell them those things when I feel like I need to vent and I‚Äôm ok with them only answering in the lines of  ‚Äúshit, this is tough. Let me know if I can do something to help.‚Äù

And I also have other friends that are super ok with me being absent from time to time, and when I‚Äôm on those periods of non crisis I talk to them by text and even see them occasionally to talk and have fun, and it seems like nothing have changed on our friendship. 


I‚Äôm very lucky to have them, but I know that this is due to the fact that I was honest with each one of them and I asked them for comprehension. Some of them just disappeared from my life with time, but I made other friends and those who I kept are really understanding and supportive. 



So I guess this is a tip for those of you who don‚Äôt know How to handle friends during your lows. 

Instead of disappearing without a warning and being embarrassed to contact them later, or making yourself present on their lives and, consequently, being rude or down in your interactions (which makes them not wanting to be your friend on the long run). Be honest and don‚Äôt be ashamed to ask what you need. 

It is a disease, and unfortunately it is a chronic one for most of us. So don‚Äôt apologize for taking care of yourself the best you can, even if you have to disappear from time to time to do that. 

The right friends will help you with that. 



Another tip: don‚Äôt waste your time with acquaintances. 

You need to have a good relationship with the people that is part of your daily life, like relatives, colleagues, friend of a friend. So be polite and helpful whenever you can. But don‚Äôt put your energy and mind on those relationships. You already have so little of it. You should use it to the things that are important to you.


Do you need to go to a party from a colleague from work or go out to look for s gift to s baby shower for a distant relative? Do you have to call all your relatives on their birthday and go out of your way to do a favor to your friend‚Äôs friend that you see sometimes and chat with them socially on those occasions?  Hell no, you don‚Äôt have to do any of that. Saying ‚Äúno‚Äù while being polite it‚Äôs totally ok, and should be done by everyone, not just us. 

If the person gets upset because they feel entitled to your time/money/effort, to hell with them. Who cares? They are not important enough to be more than acquaintances anyway, and if they say shit to others about you, the important people in your life already know your situation and won‚Äôt listen to their comments. 


I hope these tips can help someone."
DAE feel like they don‚Äôt really want the future anymore?,"I had a conversation with my brother recently and he was talking about how i‚Äôm going to be applying for top universities and how I could get business scholarships to help pay for it and secure a job placement if i‚Äôm one of the top performers which I could be, and how I need to consider the amount of debt i‚Äôll be in from it when I get married, buy a house, get a car, have kids etcetera. I just... don‚Äôt feel optimistic about my prospects anymore. I don‚Äôt even care about the debt, I can‚Äôt see myself ever buying a house and I can‚Äôt even bring myself to imagine having a s/o and kid‚Äôs. All I want to do is go to bed and not move from under the covers... I don‚Äôt know when this even happened. I was at the top of my school for exams, got accepted into one of the best colleges in my country, and i‚Äôm studying hard to get good grades in my subjects as well as maintaining extracurriculars. Everything i‚Äôm doing points towards having a successful future but I don‚Äôt think I really care anymore."
A survival story for anyone who wants to hear it üôÇ,"I‚Äôve been depressed since about age ten. The initial symptoms were nothing concerning considering I was starting to become a pubescent teenager; tired all the time, isolating, I started loosing friends, no suicidal thoughts yet but it was in the making. My family moved to Colorado and I had no real friends for two years. I made one good friend in seventh grade who later tried to bully me. My dad got more violent and angry as time went on. I dropped off the cliff around eighth grade. I remember crying late at night because I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep or didn‚Äôt want to and have to face the next day so soon. My parents, or rather my mom I should say, noticed and tried to help the way she knew how. I told her I was depressed, and she thought I‚Äôd meant a little melancholy. It wasn‚Äôt until a year and a half later that she figured out what‚Äôd been going on with me. I made it halfway through my freshman year of high school. I missed school frequently, I still didn‚Äôt sleep much at all, and I began cutting. My grades dropped and I got my first B since elementary once grades came in. My parents were concerned but they couldn‚Äôt understand why everything was falling apart all of a sudden. I was naturally the villain since they didn‚Äôt know what else to blame it on. I still panic a little when I think about standing behind my mom and listening to my dad scream vulgarities and insults over the phone about how it‚Äôd be easier to give up on me. He apologized but it‚Äôs hard to look him in the eyes after everything he‚Äôs done over the years. I was mentally dead by then. My plan was to climb into the mountains behind my house and freeze to death before anyone could find me. The morning before I was going to do the deed I skipped class and begged my mom to let me leave. When she didn‚Äôt I started thinking of how to accelerate my plan. There was a bridge across town tall enough to end it, about twenty minutes walk away. I walked past the counselor‚Äôs office before I was going to leave and paused for a moment. I was desperate, but not for death just for relief from my suffering. Thank god I made the right choice. I don‚Äôt remember how I got there but I talked to one of them, he specializes in mental health issues. It didn‚Äôt take long for him to call the police and my parents. Of course, I was escorted out of the school and sent to a mental hospital the next day. It took a while, half a year maybe, but I was prescribed antidepressants and I‚Äôm on my way to recovery. There‚Äôve been a few rough patches since, one more mental hospital visit and carbon monoxide poisoning, but I‚Äôm alive and well. Maybe even happy I guess. I‚Äôve taken up guitar, I‚Äôm learning how to sing, I started playing soccer again, and school, for the most part, is going well. During my lowest point I was more willing to die than give life another chance, but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm alive now. I‚Äôm not depression free yet, but it‚Äôs only a matter of time. Good luck to you all, it really does get better."
How do I be less snappy when I‚Äôm talking to my mom?,"I‚Äôm always so damn frustrated and impatient with my mom; I always feel like she‚Äôs saying the same things over and over. I understand why: when people care about one another they tend to just say the same shit to try and help even though none of us can really help one another.

I just want to know how to be less frustrated so I don‚Äôt hurt her."
In this moment...,"Right now, in this moment, I feel for the first time in 7 years that I might be able to survive. I might be able to live as an adult in this world. I‚Äôll have to keep working so fucking hard to live with my mental illness, but maybe, just maybe, I can do that. Maybe someday I will be happy and want to live. Maybe someday I will be able to put aside this belief that nothing exists and nothing matters and just live for the sake of living. Maybe I will find love, maybe I will get a job, maybe I will get my license, maybe I will get a peaceful night of sleep.

This hopeful feeling isn‚Äôt going to last, but I want to get it down so I can look back tomorrow and remember. Maybe I can inspire someone with my words. Whoever you are, person reading this, take care of yourself. Thanks for reading."
"if you are hurting, Please read this, my story might help give you the courage to fight back against the darkness. I‚Äôm always here to listen to anyone who needs it.","So I‚Äôve been living with multiple mental disorders my entire life and on top of it all, I‚Äôm autistic. 

God knows I‚Äôve been in some dark places in my life, abusing drugs, alcohol, cigarettes. Thoughts of suicide constantly creeping into my head. Broken relationships, heartbreak, loneliness. 

In my 23 years on this planet, I have always thought, ‚Äúwhy me?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy was I out here with so many issues?‚Äù And I just had so much anger towards my parents for creating me with issues. I told friends I didn‚Äôt have plans past 30 years old. I told them I didn‚Äôt want to get married and ruin someone, I didn‚Äôt want kids and pass on my disabilities to them and ruin their lives too. I felt happy when I was alone and sad when I was with friends. I‚Äôm sure a lot of you feel these same things on a daily basis too. 

But I finally reached out to my family and they supported me and my close friends supported me. I quit doing drugs, started going to the gym and got myself into the best shape of my life. I went from almost dropping out of college with a 2.2 GPA 2 years ago to graduating 3 weeks ago with a 3.0 GPA and a degree in Public Relations with a minor in General Business. I built new relationships with people I never would‚Äôve met if I dropped out. 

I gained confidence and started asking out and talking to girls who would have made me shake and sweat profusely if I tried to talk to them before this. I‚Äôve had dates with sorority girls, and it‚Äôs proof that we can all make changes in our lives no matter how tough we have it. It‚Äôs just about confidence and self esteem. 2 things in my life that were extremely low until I started self evaluating myself. Started practicing speaking in my room. Started smiling at myself in the mirror, trying to ignore the flaws I used to see. Now I can speak in front of entire classes and my clients. Can talk to attractive girls and make them feel nervous for a change. You can all do this too. I promise.

Lord knows I still struggle everyday. I still get the dark thoughts that try to get me to relapse, but I‚Äôm trying to be a better person, to challenge myself everyday to do something new, talk to somebody different, make new friends, go on adventures. And my demons will always be there in my head, grabbing me and trying to pull me back into my darkness, but for now, I‚Äôm here fighting like crazy because I will not go back into the darkness without a fight. 

Find that one friend who truly supports you and has your best interests. For me it‚Äôs my best friend. When I start to feel darkness, I face time her and she is always there to pick up and talk to me no matter what time it is. She listens to me and gives me advice, and sometimes it‚Äôs harsh advice but it‚Äôs what I need at the time. She gives me peace of mind, she truly loves me and I probably would‚Äôve taken my life if I didn‚Äôt meet her 2 years ago. Find that person in your life and when you do, hold them close, don‚Äôt let go because we all need support if we‚Äôre going to make it through the pain.

For everyone out there struggling, You will get through this. We are the strongest people out there. We face death and darkness and stare it in the eyes. We push it away from us and we‚Äôre still here. No one can call us weird or different because we aren‚Äôt boring and ordinary. We are strong, unique individuals who have a story to tell. You are all beautiful and full of life. Please don‚Äôt ever feel like you aren‚Äôt worth anything because I grew up with those thoughts and once I figured things out, I realized that I still have a lot to give to this world, even if I am autistic, even if I have borderline personality disorder and OCD and severe depression and anxiety. Through all of my disorders, I‚Äôve still managed to make my life into something I can feel proud of, even if it took me 23 years of pain and suffering to get here. I love you all. Keep fighting and remember how beautiful and unique you all are:) treat everyday like a step in the right direction. Try and do something each day that brings you positivity. For me it‚Äôs art, but it could be sports, cooking, reading a good book, etc. find your happiness and carry that with you. We got this guys. I promise:)"
I am depressed and I lost all of my friends. I feel so alone.,"For my entire life, I have dealt with severe persistent depression (dysthymia as the diagnosis) and anxiety. I have gone through a lot of stuff, especially toxic friendships throughout life. These past few months have been especially tough for me. I got involved in a ""relationship"" that didn't end up in a relationship due to his and my own mental instability. He refused to work together on it and trying to work on some things we both had issues with. This made me feel as if he didn't really care about me. Tonight he told me he definitely did not have romantic feelings for me anymore. After that, my best friend (Let's call her Katie) contacted me for help involving her struggling with suicidal thoughts (not necessarily wanting to kill herself, more so that the thought of suicide made her anxious). Anyways, after I helped her to the best of my ability, I felt great. (I want to be a therapist so this is rewarding to me if I can help anyone.) But then, she told me something. I have had this other friend for a long long time. (Let's call her Amy) Throughout high school, Amy and I had issues because her mother absolutely despised me and created issues for our friendship. I am pretty sure she blamed a lot of stuff on me to her mom so she wouldn't get in trouble for it. As a result, I began getting left out of our friend group a lot and was treated like an outcast. She has been a pretty shitty friend to me. Last year, Amy moved away to go to a different college, which made things so much easier for me, life was going great. But this summer she moved back to town and is transferring to our hometown college. Immediately life started going back to how it used to be. Katie hangs out with them a ton and I am just alone and don't really get invited. I ended up saying something to Katie and asked her if she thinks everyone is going to start excluding me again and I said something like, ""Since Amy moved back, everyone flocks to her like she is crack"". This is not a great thing to say but I was frustrated and panicking at the time. Katie was with Amy and another girl at the time, and I thought Katie wouldn't show anyone and this was a private convo (my mistake for thinking that would be true). Tonight, after feeling the gratification of helping her, Katie decided to tell me that the other girl she was with and Amy read what I said. I genuinely didn't say anything super mean, just that I was frustrated that as soon as she moves back, I get dropped. Katie told me the other girl she was with said: ""that is just disrespectful and out of line"". and Amy said, ""I'm glad I know how she really feels about me"". Sorry for the long story but now, I just feel like nothing. I feel that I mess up every friendship. But at the same time, I am frustrated with the fact that if they do anything to hurt me, it means nothing, but if I do anything I am automatically this horrible human being. They act as if they have done nothing to me. I left my group message with all my friends, which was my main source of support and I stopped talking to the boy who finally told me he has lost all romantic feelings for me. (He talked to me every day for about a month after he ""ended things"" and said he still had feelings for me for the longest time). I feel so alone and like I have hit rock bottom once again. I feel suicidal but I know myself enough to know I won't do anything. I don't want to die; I want the pain and hurt to stop. I just wish people would care for me the amount I care for them. I wish people actually understand that they hurt me and, not to be self-centered, but put themselves in my shoes for just a second."
How do I get to the point of WANTING to get better?,"TL;DR - Depressed for probably 10+ years. Heavy sucidal thoughts for about 5. Is there any chance of getting better if I don't even want to, or seeing the point of it?

Alright, gonna keep this as short as possible, since I'm tired of giving my life story and also I hate myself for whining about this and not pulling myself up. I'm a 32M from Sweden.

On the surface and in reality, my life is great. I got a job, I got a girl, I got an apartment. I got a dog. I'm healthy. I believe I'm quite intelligent (although it feels like depression has made me very much more stupider and I forget things all the time). I got it all. I can act all extroverted and social if the situation demands it. I have friends (although I barely keep in touch).

I just don't want to live. I see no point in me continuing doing so other than to not mess up the lives of my friends and family (or mostly my gf and my grandma, don't care too much about the others). I have a very detailed and thought out plan of how I would end my life, with small chances of failure. I know it's not the right thing to do, but it would just feel sooo good not to feel like a useless piece of shit who cares about no one. Who sees no future or no reason in moving on. Who gets hung up on all his failures and shortcomings. I come from a broken home with divorces, drug/alcohol/verbal and physical abuse. But I still consider my childhood to have been good. I had friends, I had fun.

Tried several different antidepressants in increasing doses over the course of 3 years. Only gave me side effects so I quit out of spite. Seen numerous doctors, psychiatrists and therapists. Only felt mocked and not taken seriously so I quit out of spite. Been admitted to the psychiatric ward (sry, google translate), a good place to get depressed by the way, but I talked my way out of there after a week.

I've tried quitting my job. Quitting my band. Quitting my girlfriend. Exercising. Eating healthier. But deep down I always knew I only made all these changes and sought help just so I could tick them off and in my suicide letter write ""look, I tried all these things and they didn't work so I killed myself instead"". Oh, and did I mention that I've only told my gf and my older sister about any of this, and getting to that took YEARS since I feel so embarrased and don't want people to get involved. They have both been supportive by the way, but I won't let them help me.

I read about people all the time saying ""just muster through, it's worth it in the end"", or ""therapy saved my life"", or ""I know it feels dark right now...It'll get better"", or ""antidepressant X changed my mindset completely"", or ""these inspirational quotes and pictures of kittens made me rethink my life choices"".But I just can't connect with or believe in that. And I know I sound like an immature spoiled brat in saying so. How does one find the motivation or the will to conquer this? I feel like giving up before actually starting the fight. It won't be worth it. I really can't see myself feeling proud, happy or satisfied about myself, or being the person I want to be. I really can't put words to my thoughts and feelings, it all sounds so banal.

I know a lot of people feel like this, like ""no one understands me, it will not work for me, there is no help I can get"" . I KNOW there is help I can get, although it hasn't for me yet. I KNOW it might get better if I put the time and effort into it. I just don't want to. I want to die. But I'm not allowed to and it pisses me off.

Ah shit, this turned into an unstructured, pathetic rant. Just read the TL;DR."
"I feel down for no reason at times, even while being with friends","Sometimes I‚Äôll be doing good and having fun with friends and then I just start feeling sad. They‚Äôll usually ask if I‚Äôm good and stuff and I say things like ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm fine‚Äù. I don‚Äôt really believe myself, and I know they don‚Äôt either at times. They tell me they are there to talk if I need, but since I feel depressed for no reason I don‚Äôt know what I would say to them. I want to talk about it but all I know is that I randomly feel depressed for no reason, there‚Äôs no big event or smaller event it‚Äôs just random. What are some things I could talk about? They want to help me and I‚Äôd like to receive it, but what am I supposed to do? Just tell them I feel depressed for no reason at times?"
19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further,"Just graduated High School May 2019 and turned 19 at then end of September but now that I'm finally done with school whats next for me? Working as a slave for 50 years? Or putting myself thousands of dollars behind just to go to college setting me back years just to still be a slave anyways? I'd rather be dead than do that. I work at a pizza place making 8.75/hr and live with my parents. My brother and I want to move out but I can't imagine doing that because that'll require me to find another job to enslave myself in and thats just not how I want my life to go on. I've seen plenty of threads here on Reddit talking about how they can't keep doing this life of working all day coming home exhausted then sleeping and doing it all over again. Like I said I'm 19 and I feel exhausted just working 6 hours a day, I'm still a teenager I should be running around young wild and free enjoying life. I sleep about 12-14 hours a day and I still take naps and otherwise I'm alone in my room playing videos games just to keep my mind off this hellbent reality I was given or typing shit on Reddit because I feel so helpless that I need someone else on the internet to see if they can give me any advise. I have absolutely no social life, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and unbearably lonely plus the realization that I either must be a slave for the rest of my life or a worthless homeless nobody on the street has caused me to become deathly depressed. I barely even eat because I'm too depressed to even crave food, I can tell I'm hungry but mentally I have no interest in food unless I'm smoking weed. I've tried meditation and have a strong interest in psychedelics for personal development but all thats done is make me realize just how fake and unreal this 21 century society really is. I'd rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for (money) green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just don't understand. It feels like I was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long I sit and logically think about it I cannot think of  way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my time/life away as a slave, or just being homeless. And to top it all off when I was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone (Including every single person close to me even teachers) started making fun of me saying things like ""crackhead"" or ""you look like an old man"", ""you look like a hobo"", ""Looks like Albert Einstein"", ""Do you wash your hair?"" and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire junior/senior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence I once had. All that I really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. Just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but there's always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. Its literally unfair for someone else to tell me  how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is ""illegal"" to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling ME that I'll be punished by other human beings if I have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent.  (or insert anything illegal that I choose to have in my life) Does the government have consent of MY BODY? Yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. Is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? To live without being under someone else's rule?  Or is that gift only given to animals in nature who don't have to live by human code? I'd literally rather be dead or anything else other than human. I just don't know what to do anymore I just live each day so sad and depressed, nothing excites me anymore and I have absolutely no motivation to even try anything anymore. I 100% don't blame drug addicts for their choices in life, smoking weed does help me feel better about myself and the position I'm in but at the end of the day all it does is make me feel better about life in that exact moment and does nothing for me in the long run which from my point of view seems completely doomed of being meaningful anyways. I'd love to have two children but if they had to go through what I'm going through right now then all their pain and depression would be all my fault and this life just isn't something I'd want to give to someone else its just not worth it. I'm too much of a wimp to just shoot myself but at the same time it'd just be so easy, I just hope that some accident happens to me thats quick and painless. There's a gun safe in my brothers room and just about every day I just imagine how peaceful it'd be after I kill myself to no longer be bound to this unforgiving world. Its almost too good to be true but I guess thats a fair trade for my life."
Do you ever want to just not exist?," Not kill yourself, but not ever exist ever again.

I have 0 friends. My family just doesn‚Äôt quite understand, and I‚Äôm too different to even want to explain it to them. My dad is financially depressed and doesn‚Äôt see the point in proceeding, and I‚Äôm feeling the same feeling he is. I just want someone to talk to who isn‚Äôt a therapist for once. I wish I wasn‚Äôt so alone all the time."
Hi! I'm the new mod,"Hi all! I'm rtmiu. I'll be taking over as mod for the time being.

Around two and a half years ago, Wulfy and I met and grew close. We were both in fairly dark places in our lives, but we helped each other through it. At some point during that, we thought that others might be helped by the same thing, so Wulfy made /r/depression_help. They looked after it too (even when it was empty), but as life went on and took over, we got preoccupied and eventually forgot. We're both sorry about that.

But the greatest thing about this place is that it managed to grow without us; even through your collective pain, stigma and struggles, you managed to make this community thrive and be there for each other. I thank you all and am inspired by your kindness and generosity. You embody the collective strength of the human spirit.

That said, this subreddit isn't without issues, or toxicity. As a mod I'll do my best to listen to everyone and keep out any hate or antagonism.  Feel free to tell me if anything is wrong, or right! I wish you all the best :)"
Girlfriend is bullied by her parents and forced to give up on her dreams.,"My girlfriend wanted to study gastronomy but her parents made comments like ""You'll smell like onions, no one will look at you."" ""Have fun working at BK."" etc. and she just gave up on everything. I tell her all kinds of positive things and how she can still chase her goals.  I keep telling her that it's her life and it shouldn't matter what they say but she totally convinced herself that she is good for nothing.  She is always bullied by her parents like this.

Yes we are still young and yes the relationship won't last forever but I don't care, I just want her to be happy in the future. Please help me with advices."
I‚Äôve been more depressed lately and am starting to feel indifferent towards my partner of 2 years. Is this normal??,"I have struggled with anxiety for many years but recently have started to feel pretty depressed (I think due to medication changes and the weather). I don‚Äôt find joy in many things anymore. I just started on Prozac but it hasn‚Äôt kicked in yet. I live with my(28F) partner(35M) of about 2 years and have started to feel sort of indifferent about the relationship. In the past I have had a lot of anxiety about our relationship and future, but now I just feel ‚Äúmeh‚Äù about it. Should I be concerned or is this a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù feeling while in a pit of depression?"
what‚Äôs wrong with me? why can‚Äôt I move?,"I haven‚Äôt been able to get out of bed, quite literally, in 2 months. Every passing day that I lay in this filth, it gets harder and harder to even want to move. I‚Äôve given in to the belief that I am worthless and useless and incapable of progress. 

I have tried several times ti get out of bed and clean myself and clean my surroundings and respond to calls and messages. Every time I try to move it is like something heavy and dark is pulling me down. Some force greater than gravity. I can‚Äôt move. 

I feel absolutely disgusting and I smell horrible. You can imagine what you‚Äôd smell/feel/look like after 2 months of not cleaning yourself. I can taste blood in my mouth which I am assuming is my gums bleeding from not brushing my teeth. I know how awful this is. You don‚Äôt have to tell me. Even with all of this...I am still unbothered. I suddenly don‚Äôt care about myself at all and I am wondering what happened to me. 

I came home from a work trip 2 months ago, threw my suitcase on the floor in my room and just went to bed. Haven‚Äôt gotten up since. Never even unpacked. I have since lost my job because I just stopped showing up. 

Now I am living in a filthy room due to my neglect. There are dirty clothes all over the floor...I can‚Äôt even see the carpet anymore. Food...leftovers...wrappers...junk all over the place. Roaches I suspect due to the leftover food. I don‚Äôt care and that‚Äôs the worst part. 

I only eat one small meal a day. I don‚Äôt even need to step on a scale to see how much weight i‚Äôve lost. I can feel my skeleton. 

I can‚Äôt cry even when I try to. I feel completely void of emotion. 

But I want to change. I want to move forward with my life but this weight I carry is so heavy...I am so overwhelmed with the amount of things I need to get done...thinking about all the effort and energy (I don‚Äôt have) that it‚Äôll take....

I‚Äôm so tired. God...I am so damn tired. 
Please...someone help"
I don't feel like I can talk to people about the magnitude of my depression,"I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for most of the last ten years. I think there is a big difference between that and the occasional feeling, which only happens very, very infrequently, that I might be so overwhelmed to do something about it.   
Obviously, the people in my life wouldn't want me dead. I have a lot of people that I love and love me, and I think that has kept me alive to be here today.   


However, I haven't been able to talk to people about this without scaring them or hurting them. I have heard a lot of 'I don't want to hear this' or 'You're making me cry' if I just begin to scratch the surface on these topics. I think the solution is that I need to go back to therapy, a therapist isn't going to cry in their office over me, and I can finally return now that I have insurance. But it just sucks not being able to talk to people.   


With my boyfriend, who I've lived with for almost three years and he's comforted me a lot in the past, he seems to be getting tired of hearing about it, or he likes to think I am getting better, and he can detect when and how, and his influence on that. I can't read his mind, but he's always commenting on my progress. Which, to be fair, has been a lot since I've met him. Before dating him, I didn't have anyone supporting me in my life, I had no will to learn to drive or get a job, and now I'm an assistant manager at a store. Not some huge accomplishment to most, but I'm FUNCTIONING, and I'm extremely happy to say that after a long road to achieving it.   


But, he has said stuff in the past just short of saying I'm 'cured'. And there are so many things I want to tell him about when he says that. Like, getting better with depression, in my experience, usually starts with the observable symptoms and behaviors. Usually the suicidal thoughts and anxieties will calm down first, then you start cleaning your room, feeding yourself, and generally functioning, and then your mind will actually begin to calm. In the last year, though, it has not really been in this order so often. Like all month I've had trouble with the dishes. For some reason standing and doing such a thoughtless task for fifteen minutes straight usually has me near tears by the end of it. Sounds stupid, no one in my life would want to hear that or understand why. I just don't know how to begin talking to someone about it."
Depression is getting worse,"So I've been stuck inside now for almost a week, I'm always so tired and every little thing seems trivial. I've been trying to keep my self occupied with crafts but everything seems to suck and no matter how hard I try I just look at my work and think I can't do one thing right. At this point i just wish I could go to work but I live with my 80+ year old grand parents and my fiance has only 80% function in his lungs due to scar tissue. If they get sick I know I'll blame myself and so I've had to take all this time off work. I feel worthless pathetic stupid and whiny for posting this. I'm really not trying to get attention I just am asking for some help. What do you guys do at times like this and I'm I just bitching? I honestly can tell but it feels like I am. Anyway I've ranted enough, if anyone has advice please let me know."
How do others find energy to continue.,"I just feel so hopeless and numb been contemplating suicide more or less daily the last 5 years atleast. Pushing 30 hate my job, really hard finding a new one and once I do my employer sabotages my references and since there is an abundance of applicants like 200 for every job in my area they simply choose another one.

Skilled craftsman in a field no longer required started my own company in highschool which went great for a few years until it didnt. Took my current shitty job to pay the bills, tried going back to college and working at the same time to avoid student loan but during my second year the depression really hit me and I dropped out and the last two years have been a constant struggle to come back mentally. I don't really enjoy anything anymore the only thing that keeps my mind occupied on more positive thoughts is spending a couple hours every day at the gym but even that is starting to diminish in effect. Pretty much isolated myself socially since I just feel worse trying to hang out with my friends.

How do others find the energy to continue trying to improve their life with constant failure and rejections? I feel like I'm stuck on the same page as if I were still 20."
My existence is meaningless,"I have no desire to live and I don't know why.  I don't think my life is that awful to be honest, I have issues but who doesn't in this world? 
There's absolutely nothing that interests me. I used to think the reason of my unhappiness is not having money. So I became obsessed with money. Now I got a higher paying job, saved a lot of money and pretty much I only work 5 hours a day, yet I am still not happy. I am just so tired of feeling dull and bored. I don't know what I want, why im alive. I envy people who enjoy life and I wish I could give the rest of my lifetime to somebody who wants it. 
I can't sleep every night because the thought of ending my life is so strong yet I dont know what is causing my suicidal thoughts."
Always late for work,"I‚Äôve been consistently late for work by about 15 minutes the past couple of weeks. My boss has noticed and asked if I‚Äôm happy in my current position. I told him I was fine and would do better to be on time. 

Every morning is a struggle to get out of bed. Every morning is a challenge, and by running late it snowballs into a stressful and triggering day. All I want to do is stay in bed and sleep. 

How do you force yourself to get out of bed? How do you deal with tardiness?"
MY BATTLE WITH DEPRESSION AND ATTEMPTED SUICIDE,"My name is Michael, I'm not a blogger nor am I a writer but I  wanted to share my story.
 June 2015 I suffered a stroke and before this happen I had a heart attack(congestive heart failure) in January 2009. At the time of the heart attack I was working in law enforcement which I think contributed to me having this along with poor eating habits. 
 I was in the hospital for the better part of a month and many of you know being in a hospital that long can lead you to having some pretty bizarre thoughts so I think that was the start of my first bout with depression. Never having dealt with it I didn't recognize or understand  what I was going through so I never got help with it, but I knew something wasn't right. Moving along to June 2015 as I mentioned I suffered a stroke which paralyzed me from my upper thighs down and I had no feeling at all and was wheelchair bound and most of the time bed ridden and it really took a major toll on me and my life. After being told 3 times that I'd never walk again and really not being able to do anything for myself, it put me in a very dark place and that's where I  started recognizing what I felt in 2009 but on a different level. I was hearing things, I was seeing things and having vivid dreams about death and I  was the killing myself each time. I also felt physical pain, inside I was so afraid but didn't wanna tell anyone about what I was going through so I put up a fake smile and pretended to be happy when I really was dying on the inside. What brought everything to the point where I wanted to end everything was one day I was home alone my son was at school and I was very thirsty so I rolled over to the fridge to get water but it was all the way to the back of the fridge. Keep in mind at the time I was in a very small wheelchair because I couldn't afford one for my size, and when I reached to get the jug the chair tilted forward and I almost was thrown out of it. Filled with anger and disgust feeling like I was burden to everyone I rolled the chair to my room and I was crying I couldn't see straight my head was fogged up I went to my closet and grabbed my AR15 and rolled back to the kitchen table put 2 shells in the clip, put the gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger. To my surprise the gun didn't fire so now I'm really crying and pained I pulled the trigger again and the gun didn't shot again something it's never done before. I felt so low because I  said I can't even do this right, took the gun threw it on the floor and went to get all my pills I knew that would work as I'm coming down the hallway something said look up and when I did I saw a picture of both my kids and I  screamed so loud crying thinking about what I almost did, still holding my box of pills. I almost took myself from my babies!! Not even 20 minutes after all this happened my mom walked in my house and I grabbed her crying I've never hugged and held onto my mom so hard in my life. I started telling her about what I was about to do and what I had been going through I INSTANTLY started feeling a calm come over me. For years I was embarrassed to tell anyone my story and how God spared my life that day. Depression is real and if you feel anything I describe talk to someone please and to anyone whose lost a loved one to suicide talk to someone it will save a life if people know there's someone that can help them"
Moments like these make me so happy,"I was having troubles sleeping tonight, so I decided I'd just get on the PC and play CS:GO until I felt tired enough to sleep. I went to deathmatch and hit ""go"", and then I got sent to a game. First thing I noticed when I got to the ""terrorist / anti-terrorist"" screen was that the entire game was filled with bots, except for one person. When I started playing, I heard a younger boy crying on the mic. I decided to grab my mic and ask him if he was okay. He said he was on a game with a bunch of ""big kids"", and they made fun of him for his voice, and they booted him out. I started talking to him and told him about my personal story about being bullied and stuff like that. After a while, I asked him if he wanted to join a game with me that had actual players. He said yes, and as we both picked the same team, I said over the mic, ""Let's get 'em, dude!"", and he excitedly said, ""Yeah, let's get 'em!"" And... Our team lost. But he didn't care. He was just so happy that he had someone nice to game with that wouldn't make fun of him. We can all learn a lesson from this. At one point in our lives, we all were in his shoes. What we need to do is make sure that we're all taken care of. üñ§"
depression is getting worse,"this is kind of just rambling but i‚Äôve been depressed for literally as long as i can remember and i cant take it anymore. everyday just feels like a chore to get through. when i meet new people they‚Äôre supportive at first but over time they just get annoyed bc it never goes away and they end up leaving, so i‚Äôve just taken to not venting to friends bc it‚Äôs only ever made things worse. growing up i was a smart kid and now i‚Äôve failed out of college multiple times and am in extreme debt because of it. i‚Äôm stuck living with my parents and all i want is to move out but i can‚Äôt hold down a job. i‚Äôve tried every antidepressant available to me as well as multiple kinds of therapy, TMS, partial programs and inpatient. nothing helps. i don‚Äôt want to die i just want to be happy but it feels like there‚Äôs nowhere to turn. i love life and i love people, the only reason i don‚Äôt end everything is because i know how much it would hurt people in my life. i just want to be able to experience happiness and not be so tired everyday and constantly overwhelmed with thoughts of hurting myself. i try so hard every single day to get better and it only gets worse. i‚Äôve called or texted hotlines in the past but it just made me suicidal because it just makes it more obvious there‚Äôs nothing that can be done. i think if the coronavirus wasnt going on i‚Äôd probably admit myself to inpatient but that doesn‚Äôt really seem possible right now. plus when i‚Äôve gone to inpatient in the past they haven‚Äôt really helped me, i barely even got therapy they just made sure i didn‚Äôt kill myself but didn‚Äôt do anything to make those thoughts go away. i‚Äôm in so much pain. i don‚Äôt know what else to do."
"Healing emotional wounds is uncomfortable, but the short sting beats losing your mind to a lifetime of despair.","Been writing a daily affirmation for myself each morning when I wake up - I check in with what I need for the day and I've found it really helpful. Last night I finally got to talk to a friend I've been feeling a lot of hurt over, it's not all better, but certainly just being able to have a conversation helped.   


Healing from emotional wounds takes action, but I often get stuck in the  fear or laziness of taking that first step - even though I know I'd  feel way better if I did something. It's good to remind myself that  inner conflicts don't just go away, they require communication, therapy,  totally changing my life by moving or traveling, meditating, finding  forgiveness, eating differently - they require me to take action. I want  to feel good in this life, so I do the work on the road to recovery.  And I can't just try once and then give up, I have to keep going and  trust that working through the initial discomfort will eventually lead  to feeling better. Sometimes multiple conversations are needed,  sometimes switching therapists or trying multiple jobs is necessary -  the healing is there, it just takes effort.

Why can't my friends and family see that I'm not fine?,"So this is hard for me, I really don't know where to start. I've never felt fine, in my 31 years I can't remember actually feeling happy. Sure I smile and pretend I'm ok to everyone I know. I get myself to work each day too, but only because it's a routine. 

Pretty much twelve months ago something happened that triggered me to be bad enough that I couldn't sleep and I was having panic attacks about nothing.  So I finally saw a doctor and she diagnosed me with anxiety, depression and stress... And referred me to see a psychologist but I've had bad experiences with councilors when I was really bad at uni. So I got anxious about it and never went. I didn't want to be judged for what happened either.

I've tried to reach out to my partner, but she has anxiety too. If I lean on her too much she drops her bundle. She tells me she's happy and relentlessly reminds me that she wants to get married and have kids because we're getting older. I've told her that I'm not having kids until I feel better, then I smile once and some how in her mind that makes me better. Otherwise we work really well together, except I never really feel like I feel in love with her. 7 years on I'm still waiting for that spark.

My family is fine, nothing bad ever really happened and we all talk, but it feels like they wouldn't notice if I wasn't around. They are so self obsessed, they call me to whine about the mundane things in there lives but never really ask how I am or if they do don't listen to what I have to say.

I hate my job, sure most people do, but I find it so sole destroying. Feeling so shitty, I find it impossible to apply for others. I feel so trapped.

I don't really have any friends I feel I can trust. At any rate I never let them see the depressed me, just my well practiced smiling facade.

Ultimately I feel so incredibly lonely and isolated. Ive thought about leaving everything behind and taking a trip. Riding to Alaska and back again type thing. I've thought about breaking up, but I only feel like I would be more alone.

I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either trapped in this terrible no man's land I've created for myself. Reddit can you help me figure my shit out.

Tldr, i feel trapped in my situation in life and need help getting help XD

Edit: I'm overwhelmed by the kindness of everyone here, I truely appreciate everyone who took the time to read or comment. "
I'm about to lose my mind please someone help,"I just can't take it anymore! i feel like shit again. i'm scared to be alone again. i want to break this vicious circle but it keeps spinning around me! please somebody help me! I feel that my heart is about to get torn apart. i have no friends to trust either internet or real life, not a single fucking person want to help me. I am lost and i don't know what to do! please somebody help"
To whoever needs to hear this...,"I was Army Infantry for 10 years. Did 3 tours in Iraq. I've had PTSD and depression for a while now. It gets really dark sometimes, even with my wife (who is wonderful) and kids (who are great but a handful) pulling me up. I've checked myself into the VA mental ward for suicide thoughts, been fired for threatening co-workers, and lost friends because of the way I speak.

It does get better. It's a struggle everyday. It's not easy at all. But there are reasons to keep going, to keep trying to make things better. I don't have all the answers. Hell most days I don't have any answers. I just have hope I guess.

Keep fighting. You can pull through."
Curious?,"Does any body go through periods were they are ""ok"" and then other days they just want to die. But they don't want to ""kill themselves"" as in slicing there wrists? They just want to disappear, not exist any more. "
I'm obsessing over a man that doesnt think twice about me.,"So here's the deal. I've been involved off and on with this guy for over a year, with a strong falling out ending our ""friends with benefits"" the first time. But once we matured and got over it, we started seeing each other again. I've always had feelings for him, but have kept them at bay. He's very aware of these feelings because I've told him. However, he doesnt want ANYTHING more than booty calls and the occasional sleep over. He's honestly kind of an asshole, but I am so fucking infatuated with him that it scares me. I find myself constantly checking to see if he's read my messages or is online or has posted something. I can't stop thinking about him. 
I try so hard to keep myself distracted with work or hobbies, but my mind immediately goes right back to him when it's all done... 
What do I do? I want him to show some kind of emotional bond towards me, but I know that's not something I can control. I need help accepting the situation I'm in. 
I honestly think I'm so head over hills for him because I dont think I'm good enough for anything more. I'm overweight, and he's gorgeous and fit. I feel like I dont deserve or can't get more than him."
On my Way!,I‚Äôm one month clean tomorrow!
I gave up,All I do is eat sleep and lay on the couch. I dont want to do anything else. I dont even want to do that. Nothing makes me happy. I‚Äôm on meds. Plenty of them. Nothing matters. How do I get out of this?
"No longer so suicidal, but still have 'death envy' Is that normal/healthy?","I'm in a much better place and generally more content and healthier mentally. I no longer feel like jumping in front of a train or hurling myself off a building. But I feel ok if my plane were to crash for example, I feel that's fine n peaceful. Also when thinking of ones who have passed away, I have a tinge of 'death envy', like they have moved on and no longer deal with the trivial things in life. I still want to live tho.

Is that healthy?"
I don't see a future. I find that ultimately I am a useless lump living. Might as well be a dead lump. That way I could be disposed off and people can get on with their lives. I am sorry.,"Meh.
Edit: Thanks to all who answered. Still alive. Not there yet. Some days are still incredibly difficult. And no the future is still hazy. But, somehow I have been pushing, and hope those of you who have been feeling hopeless and suicidal may feel better."
[meta] This sub kinda sucks.,"I don't really see the difference between this sub and /r/depression. I unsubscribed from /r/depression because all it does is worsen my mood and give me bad ideas. I thought this sub was going to be more about ways to get better and how to work on improving, but it's a bunch of people talking about how shitty their depression is. And I get that depression sucks, obviously, but honestly one of the worst things for my mental health is reading about how shitty life is. I want to read about cool articles and advice from the community that show me how to feel better. Posts here should be neutral or positive. If you need to rant, go to /r/depression. I Nobody here is able to be your therapist and this sub can't be their replacement. That doesn't belong on a sub with this name. If not /r/depression, then another sub should be made for ranting. 

As this sub is, I can't imagine how this sub could help anyone. There are almost no rules here and no standards for content. I've been subbed for a while but everything here has brought my mood down and ruined my mindset, so I've unsubbed. That doesn't even mention the good hearted laymen who don't really offer useful advice."
Had to cry today...,"I really thought today was going to be the first day of 2020 I didn't cry. Can I please just have one day where the tears don't flow? I have been trying so hard with medication, therapy and self care but every day my eyes end up red and raw. I'm just so tired of even trying anymore. I'm ready for the hurt to be over."
Overwhelming Sadness,"Does anyone else just get hit with an overwhelming amount of sadness and the feeling of being stuck in life? I‚Äôm in the bathroom at work just sobbing, and I can‚Äôt stop."
Does anyone else feel like the saturation in their life is turned down?,"The best way I can describe how I feel is: feeling as if someone has turned down the saturation in my life.

I can feel emotions. When I‚Äôm with friends and family or watch a funny video I laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? Lifeless? Like on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the happiest) I know I should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason I can‚Äôt seem to get past a 5 at most. It‚Äôs like my brain is saying ‚Äúthis is funny you should laugh and feel happy‚Äù but I just don‚Äôt feel that? At least not fully. It‚Äôs like my 5 is other people‚Äôs 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. When other people are laughing so much they‚Äôre in tears and can‚Äôt catch their breath I‚Äôm only chuckling, even though I *know* the situation is funny. I can‚Äôt even remember a time where I laughed so much I was in tears. When I laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that I could just as easily not do. This is hard to explain but when I laugh and smile it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm not physically feeling it. What I imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when I smile/laugh the outside physically changes but inside I don‚Äôt feel anything. It almost feels as if I‚Äôm acting but I‚Äôm not because I do know the situation is funny. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a disconnect somewhere. It‚Äôs hard to explain. 

And this is just one emotion, I feel this with everything. The only emotions I seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyance/anger and sadness, but even that‚Äôs toned down, not saturated, lifeless."
I just don't care anymore. I've pretended to be happy for 8 years now and its fucking killed me.,"I want to pretend like I'm happy and i actually matter but I just don't see the point. I've broken or ruined every thing and relationship I've ever had and it was always my fault. Anytime I get angry I hit something. Ironic as I'm scared of confrontation and can only take out my anger on inanimate objects. 

I don't know why but I feel like everything's getting worse even though just a couple days ago I could keep up the facade no problem. Everyday it's the same vision, I can't stop it and it terrifies me. It starts with me just looking down at a knife and I just put it right in my throat. it's only been different like 6 times and instead of stabbing myself I shoot someone I considered a great friend for 5 years. I don't even know what I think of him anymore and I can't say the thought of him dying hurts me because truly I couldn't care less.

I've been thinking recently and I realized I've never actually done something good in my life so I understand why my life has been this way. No one has ever turned out better because they met me, the best thing they do for themselves is never talking to me again."
I‚Äôm a high school senior and I‚Äôve officially lost everything I‚Äôve had to look forward to,"I‚Äôm 17 years old from Texas, in my senior year of high school and after working so hard and having some of the hardest years of my life through high school I was really looking forward to seeing all my hard work pay off, but now I‚Äôm not getting that opportunity just like so many others. When the whole corona virus stuff started I never though it would hit this close to my home and that it would have this big of an impact on everything, I had already paid for my cap and gown and had my senior pictures done and even my invitations were ready to go but now the pictures and invitations are all in a box in my parents closet. I think the worst part about this is that no one seems to care and when it‚Äôs brought to their attention all they have to say is some shit like ‚ÄúOh sorry, life happens‚Äù what the hell am I supposed to do with that? I worked so hard to keep my depression under control but this has just put me at a whole new low and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen to me if I can‚Äôt find some help from someone soon.. I could really use some comfort and help right now..."
"Hi, I'm 16 and I need help, I don't wanna relapse.","Hi, I'm Blake. I've had depression since I was 8 and I started Zoloft and Lamictal at 14. I've had a lot happen to me, I think all of us have. I've been doing better. I quit porn (or I haven't orgasmed to it), I've tried being nicer, and I'm working on being a better person. The issue is...I've been an asshole to my parents as of late..I made my mom cry with how I don't respect her. I've done so many fucked up things in the past, stuff I can't even speak of. I try to forgive myself, but I can't. I just wallow in self pity when I get sad and play the victim. I have been the victim, yet I use it as an excuse at times. I need help forgiving myself for the things I've done, they haunt me every day. I say I'll change, and I do for a while...but then I relapse. I can't accept that I need to feel shitty for the things I've done. I would like some advice, real advice, on how to forgive yourself even after continuously messing up after you say you'll be better. I need help. Thank you.

Edit: thank you for all the support, it means a lot. I'm sorry I didn't flesh out my post, but it's just hard to dwelve into. If you wanna hear stuff, just message me, I don't wanna plague you all on here with my issues. Seriously, thank you though."
How do I help my depressed gf,"my gf seams to be really close to serious depression I talked with her the other day and she told me all this stuff about how sad she is how nothing excites her how she doesnt feel it matters If she died. all of this is new to me and I think very logically so my natural answer is to come up with a solution. like ""tell me the things that make you happy"" ""try to think more positive"" stuff like that but this isnt the correct answer I know she doesnt want a solution right now but I don't know what to give and I want to help her. advice?"
I think I'm losing control. I'm getting therapy and have the support of family and friends and it's not getting better.,"From Mid December to March I witnessed my girlfriend's (both mid 20's) steep decline into depression and felt totally helpless. I've been working with my own therapist lately and I've come to the realization that during her depression, I went through a steep decline in self-esteem because of the immense shame I was feeling.   


I feel totally inadequate as a person. I wasn't funny enough to cheer up my girlfriend, I wasn't smart enough to find a solution for her, I wasn't strong enough to save her. At the lowest point in her depression, She started cutting, drinking and smoking. She also completely pushed me away and started hanging out with people we both used to describe as ""toxic"" when things were good.  


I tried my best to support her with what I knew at the time. I always told her she wasn't alone and that I was there for her, I encouraged her to seek help from a therapist/medical team. When she asked for space, I tried my best. I never pressured her to be intimate (her depression stems from sexual assault in the past), I avoided her triggers (the one's I knew about). I do have regrets though, I know I could have been a better listener. I tried to fix things for her even though I know now that I couldn't.

&#x200B;

In February she asked for complete separation for a few weeks so she could work on herself and I did that for her. It was the hardest time in my life. I was so scared for a number of reasons and I constantly ran through scenarios in my head ranging from ""she's having fun without me and doesn't want me"" to ""she's going to commit suicide"". We met up once 2 weeks into no-contact and I was in a bad place. I felt totally rejected and I was very vulnerable in front of her. I cried in her car for about an hour and she tried to comfort me. I know she wasn't in a place to support me, but I was a mess.  


After a few weeks of no-contact, we met up again and she had decided she needed to work on herself and try and heal, and that she couldn't be in a relationship at the same time. She broke up with me the day before my first scheduled therapist appointment. I also think she felt guilty for my decline in self-esteem over the past few months and thought that I would be better without her in my life.   


After 6 weeks I've gotten to a point where I understand that neither of us were in a position to support each other the way things were. I'm grappling with serious shame because I continue to blame myself for her depression, as well as the ways I've acted since breaking up. In the first few weeks, we saw each other a few times, and one day she was really upset and I was able to comfort her until she calmed down. After calming down, she told me she loved me and tried to kiss me. I talked with her after this and told her I'm always here to listen and support her, but I couldn't hear her say ""I love you"" or go back to being in a relationship. She apologized and since then we've barely talked.

&#x200B;

Through friends, I've found out she's doing quite a bit better and she's finally having more good days that bad. She's on the road to recovery without me, and I feel like I'm still in a downward spiral. She won't talk to me at all, she deleted me on facebook and our mutual friends are starting to get fed up with me because she's all I can talk about. It feels like every interaction I have with people,  I twist into a narrative that I'm a bad person. I feel so ashamed that I couldn't help her, and that now that she's starting to do better, I can't just feel happy for her and leave it at that. I'm feeling jealousy whenever I think of her being happy, because it's not with me, and then I feel guilty for not being able to happy for her recovery. It's a viscous cycle."
My puppy died,"Today is an awful day. Started with my work from home job task that I wasnt able to solve on my own (it was petty, I'm a software developer), me being stupid not reading about hidden fees on shipping of products i bought abroad of which I intend to start a business with, not being able talk to my boyfriend whom I havent seen for months due to Quarantine protocols in my country, and my pet who died just hours ago because of a mistake im partly responsible of üò¢ i know a lot of people are going through something much much worse, but I just need to speak it out as I dont have someone to cry on right now. :("
gf broke up with me,"Some days ago my gf broke up with me because of my stupid depression, just when I was trying to get out and being happy most of the time, she calls me, tells me she wants to see me and me missing her ( went back from brazil ) went the next day to see her.
She tells me that she can‚Äôt handle me anymore, that I didn‚Äôt seem to care about my depression and that she doesn‚Äôt want to be with me anymore. I didn‚Äôt say a word, just fucking cried on the restaurant table. After saying goodbye to her and telling her I‚Äôll be okay, trying not to cry, I buy some blades ( y‚Äôknow where this is going ) and walk home. You know what I do with those blades so there‚Äôs no need to write it. I just erased all my accounts, I‚Äôm trying to forget everyone I knew ‚Äòcause I can‚Äôt do anything but remember her and it fucks me up. I can‚Äôt do anything to not think about her and it‚Äôs killing me. I had depression for 4-5 years and now, it‚Äôs worse than ever for that fucking things she had to say. I really need someone to tell me nice things again, It‚Äôs not gonna cure me but at least I hope you guys can help, I‚Äôm desperate for some form of dealing with this, please."
"my life is literally ruined,i will kill myself tomorrow"," 

lemme start by saying when i was in junior school my grades were A+. and i were acing every exam literally,but in highschool? my life went downhill,i became lonley,depressed,failure,no one would talk to me cause of my anxiety,i got bullied by everyone i know,even girls used to bully me cause im shy and have social anxiety,even tho all of that i managed after highschool to get into college,i was happy and i thought i sorted life out,at first semester when the mid terms (quizzes) started i used to rank 4 or 5 out of 40,i used to study,BUT everyone continued to ignore me,i would do lab hours alone,eat food alone,and ya u guessed it my classmates used to talk shit behind my back,i once put my phone to record what they say when im not there,i expected no one to talk about me,but all of them were like why does dude come to uni,he's useless,i felt dead at that moment its like something my spirit out and just lemme control this human vessel,no feelings inside,nowdays i sleep 10+ hours,barely study,and i spent most of my hours when im not sleeping on porn...,just i should do it? do i have something to live for? im 22 and i never know how does it feel to be loved/or even liked for fuck sake,i just want someone to message me without asking for favors,why humans are so fucking selfiesh"
"If you need a friend to talk to, PM me at anytime, any hour, any day.",We could talk about anything. I don't judge at all. I'm always here for you.  
Waking up sad,"Updating. Today has not been as horrible. ( I still got nothing accomplished though) It‚Äôs night now and I want to share something that I‚Äôm currently listen to and it‚Äôs soothing. On Pandora, Ragamuffin radio. Found it by accident. It‚Äôs all instrumental, mostly acoustic guitar. It‚Äôs raining here and it fits together nicely. Hoping I get a good nights sleep. Peace to all. 

I hate waking up like this. Day after day. It‚Äôs afternoon and I‚Äôm still on the brink of tears constantly. Nothing is really wrong , it‚Äôs just that nothing is right. I‚Äôm very alone. I have many things to get done, but nothing to look forward to. Another day of bleakness. The sound of my neighbors lawnmower annoys me all to hell. I do t like where I live, I‚Äôm too undecided to pack up and move. And just lacking strength.  I‚Äôm slightly disabled. 

I make casual searches on places I‚Äôd like to go. But I hear it‚Äôs bad to make major life decisions when depressed. I could end up in a beautiful new location, but the bleakness inside me is still there. I still don‚Äôt connect with other human beings.  Still alone.  Sigh. 

I‚Äôm not on any antidepressants. I‚Äôve tried many and none helped. I wish I could just make this feeling go away."
My friend just died and I don‚Äôt know how we can correctly mourn him because covid19 quarantining.,It absolutely tearing me a part and making depression even worst.
How Can I stop being so insecure and self depricating?,"So I was taught from a young age being too forward and confident was a way to make people not like you, that everyone prefers you to be self depricating. I am super insecure in my friendships and relationships, not about the other person, but about me.

I have autism, its incredibly hard for me to read specific emotions, and also ""read the room"" as it were, which has lead to some serious issues with human interaction in the past. I overshare, overanalyze and overthink EVERYTHING. And it leads to me constantly feeling like I'm not worthy of any relationship, not worthy to feel emotions that I do feel, and CONSTANTLY question if what I'm feeling is fair, or even my own damn fault.

I'm deeply in love with my partner, he's everything to me, but I can't identify anything he does that annoys, or frustrates me. He has told me in the past things I do that frustrate and annoy him. He has said certain things that made these feelings of inadequacy worse. He didnt mean to hurt me, he deserves to be honest about these things, and I have been doing my best to work on them and better myself. 


But ALL OF THIS, together, has made me a depressed, anxious and nervous wreck. I want to be healthy for him. I want to work on myself and be my best. But I also want that for me. I want to be independant and secure in knowing that even though I do have things to work on, I'm still...worth it. Worth his trouble, worth his patience, worth his love. Im so tired of feeling worthless.

TL;DR
Struggling with my old habits in a new relationship, want to feel more secure in myself on my own, without outside validation. Want to know when and when it isnt appropriate to mention needs being met, or not being met."
I prefer my fake life,"(First of all sorry for my English, it is not my mother tongue)
Title. I am a 18 y.o. boy and for almost two years I have been creating fake profiles on social media, last one I created is the only one I use now and is a 18 y.o. girl. With her I have many online good friends and I can talk with them when I feel sad, they always make me feel better and that's the reason I can't delete that fake profile. I could but never take advantage of that profile for making money or anything, the only thing I want is friends.
In my real life I have a couple friends but they're as emotionally reserved as me, so we don't talk about our problems or emotions. I tried but can't find a friend who can talk about this. Where I am from boys must be cold and without emotions.
I want to leave that fake profile because I'm too attached to it, I spend hours per day on it, but I can't. I don't know what to do. Help is appreciated."
I just can‚Äôt anymore.,"My best friend got married yesterday, but didn‚Äôt even bother to tell me that he was getting married.  I only found out after other people I know started posting photos from the wedding.  I don‚Äôt know what I did to deserve this.

He was my last friend, but not really I guess.

I am transgender and since coming out all of my friends have abandoned me, one-by-one until he was all that was left.  I get it though, truly, who wants to be friends with someone like me?  Hell, even after well over a year of hormones, makeup practice, and other efforts I could never hope to pass as a woman.  It‚Äôs probably just too embarrassing to be seen with me; even the trans subreddits barely register my selfie attempts.  The only people who ever say anything positive about me are people I pay.

I have been trying to stay positive, but this is bullshit.  I just want something to go right for me; just for once.    I go out of my way to help people all the time, listen to their problems, and just generally try to be positive.  It makes me sad and angry that I don‚Äôt have anyone who would be like that for me.

Halp."
Eating well while really depressed,"I find it really hard to remember to eat since I don‚Äôt have the energy to cook and can‚Äôt afford to always eat out. I‚Äôve been buying groceries and then I end up not being able to cook them and it they go bad. I really would like to reduce my food waste while still eating well because I know that‚Äôs important. I‚Äôve got some things with protein, grains, and healthy fats that have been good but I‚Äôm really struggling with fruits and vegetables. Even just going through the effort to was and cut fruits and vegetables seems like too much. And I have a weird aversion to eating things without cutting them. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Tl;dr: Help me eat fruits and vegetables"
My client that I work with every day told me something that really hit me in my feels and fucked me up,"I work with a guy who has cerebral palsy, but it only affects his legs/feet, mentally he is fine and is pretty self sufficient‚Äî only needing help with a small amount of things.

Anyway, we were having some random discussions and he was like ‚Äúyou know why you don‚Äôt care about much or about how people treat you badly?‚Äù

And I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhat do you mean?‚Äù

And he said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt care because you‚Äôre already broken‚Äù

I was like DAMN. How accurate. When I went home I had to cry a bit on that one.

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs multiple factors/reasons for it, but I‚Äôve suffered with depression since a young age. I just didn‚Äôt know what it was for a long time."
"Someone else in my skin would be happy, I've no right to be depressed and sinking into alcoholism, yet here I am","I'm a mid 20s male, college graduate, living in a big city, have a great job. Yet I think about suicide every day. But I feel like I don't have a right to. Other people don't have a lot of the things I have. I'm objectively very lucky and have everything I could want to be happy. So why is life so hard?

I've started drinking almost every day. I'll go to the bar alone and drink. I'll drink until I get sleepy. Then I go home, and sleep. The next morning I wake up, go to the gym, and go to work. Then after work I hit the bar again. Alone.

I'm just so lonely. Why don't people like me. I try not to be an asshole. I really do. I don't think I'm an asshole? But I think people are uncomfortable around me. I think I sour their moods. I try not to be negative though. I try really hard.

I feel my youth wasting away. I feel the passage of time very heavily. These are supposed to be some great years. Maybe even the best yesrs. Single, big city, acceptably good looking. College certainly wasn't the best years for me. So maybe this is when my life is ""supposed to"" peak?

But I have no friends. I have no one to hang out with. I don't have a girlfriend. I have no one I connect with deeply.

I've tried cognitive behavioral therapy. But as soon as I stopped going (feeling like I was fixed) the problems began again. I've been medicated for depression consistently for years now. I've even added exercise to my routine at the behest of my doctor. Improved my diet. Stopped smoking weed. I feel like I've done everything.

What can I do now? I feel trapped. I wish I would just die. Life has been very kind to me, and my stupid ass can't take advantage of it. Someone with a better personality or someone more capable would have a very happy life in my skin.

I think of killing myself every day. I won't do it. But the thought, that's not normal right?

This turned into a rant and I apologize for that."
So I was handcuffed and thrown into the back of a cop car... over a phone call,"My friend Damien thought I was going to kill my self. I wasn‚Äôt going to act on anything and I never said I was going kill myself just that I was depressed over my divorce and ect.

I‚Äôm asleep it‚Äôs 11am and I get woken up by 2 hard knocks on the door. Two police officers let themselves in without even explaining why. They stated my friend called and said I was going to kill myself and they then deemed I was a risk. I refused to go with them becuase I didn‚Äôt know what the hell was going on.

They handcuffed me, threw me in the back of the car and sent me to a mental ward. I was dehumanized, traumatizes and mentally abused by the staff. I‚Äôm not sure if I have any legal rights to purse. I was on emergency detention. So they could withhold me for 72h or longer as deemed by the psychiatrist. But when I saw the psychiatrist, he saw I was fine and I was discharged 24h later. How horrible do you think I felt. :( "
Go Bike,"I tried one hour ago to have a ride with the bike , amazing feeling take you out of the world .

Try it people"
I‚Äôve lost all hope.,"A switch was flipped. I blinked. I blinked, and everything I‚Äôve worked towards improving my mental health was just snapped away like that.

I hate being the 5 billionth person to be complaining about the pandemic. But I need to get it off my chest. I wish this could all be over. Everything‚Äôs getting worse and worse. I‚Äôm not exactly doing great mental healthy wise, especially seeing how I haven‚Äôt seen my friends for 23 days now. Yes, I‚Äôve been counting. And I don‚Äôt know why. All I know is that I might not make it. Online school has been stressing me out beyond belief. The work load has just tripled and I‚Äôm constantly rushing to get shit done. We‚Äôre running out of food, with little way to get more. My mom can‚Äôt go to work because she got infected. She won‚Äôt see another paycheck for god knows how long. I can‚Äôt go find work because everything‚Äôs closed, and I too got infected. The money I have now won‚Äôt be enough.

All I can do now is lock myself in my room. Doing endless amounts of homework and waiting for the virus to kill me. Because it might. I have asthma. It hasn‚Äôt gotten to that point yet but.... at this point I want it to kill me. I don‚Äôt know when this will all be over, and I‚Äôm losing everything. I‚Äôm close to losing my friends. I keep lashing out against the people I care about and I don‚Äôt know how to stop.

It‚Äôs becoming a problem. I haven‚Äôt been able to physically interact with another person in weeks. I‚Äôm desperate for any human touch at this point. I think it‚Äôs making me more horny.... which is becoming a serious problem.

I wish my mental health wouldn‚Äôt crash down like this man. But it did, and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm outright suicidal. Maybe borderline. Again, I wouldn‚Äôt mind if it took me. No one would care anyway. My boyfriend will find someone new, someone better than him. My friends will move on. It would be fine. If the virus is going to ruin my life, then it might as well take it at this point."
My resignation,"I‚Äôm a 23 year old male who was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety a couple of years ago., and recently I was diagnosed with panic disorder. I‚Äôve been on medication for quite some time now and I‚Äôve been able to manage things up until late. I‚Äôve been working for this big company for about 4 months now and had nothing but good experiences throughout.

Last week I experienced my first panic attack. It was a ride. These attacks went on for days. And once I was able to see my doctor we found out that I had panic disorder, and that my depression and anxiety were contributing to the development of this new disorder. We discussed what I‚Äôve been experiencing and she advised me to resign from work. I decided not to do that and try to work on and power through it, but it only made things worse. 

Fast forward to today, I decided to resign from my company because my conditions were getting in the way of me being able to do the work that was expected of me, and it‚Äôs been taking a physical toll on my body as well. I had to explain to my superiors why I decided to resign, and I did my best to explain to them. To my surprise they didn‚Äôt ridicule or judge me. They gave me encouraging messages. They gave me support and understanding.

Being a young man with depression we all know that comes with it‚Äôs fair share of stigma. I was blessed enough to be employed by a company who‚Äôs superiors are understanding.

Right now I‚Äôm on the road to recovery. Hopefully it all goes well."
I want to be happy again... I hate myself,I have no friend and my anxiety it tearing me down. I fail everyone around me including myself and all I want to do is feel like I‚Äôm making someone proud. My fianc√©e doesn‚Äôt understand my anxiety which make me feel like a burden. Why does life suck so much. All I want is to feel loved. Show me you love me.
I'm nothing without my medication.,"Hey, i'm Bradley. I'm turning 16 close to the end of this year. This year's exams that are upcoming are really, really important and will determine my near future. It's stressful, but I always avoid getting stressed. Here's where the first problem comes in: when i'm not stressed, I don't worry about the exams. So in the end, there's completely no effort when the day comes.

Medication started about a month or two ago. So far, i've missed some days and yes, my psychiatrist knows. I won't elaborate on my problems but basically I have been diagnosed with depression after close to 3 years of suffering in silence. And it has been tough. Seeking help didn't relieve me that much, but it did. My mood changed a little, i'm kind of more positive in terms of my everyday life. Just school, sports and home. A cycle.

Everytime there's signs (which are triggers, but i'm afraid of telling my teachers or psychiatrist because i'm just too scared to) i'm always getting into that depressive episode. I get easily angry, especially to my friends and I tend to be impulsive during these ""anger moments"". 

It's tough dealing with depression. Really tough. Medication just makes it seem like I can't handle things on my own, and drugs are needed just for my mood to get better (I mean, when I was a child it was so easy to be happy, why not now?). I seem to never forget that without medication i'd be dead. I don't know if I should see it that way or whether I should take things on my own. It's masculinity, right? If we could handle this, we're stronger than others, right?

People always tell us that it'd be better if they understood what I was going through, but must I really tell _everyone_ that I have depression?"
I‚Äôm depressed and can‚Äôt tell anyone,Can anyone please help me bc I scroll through YouTube and Reddit for hours every night and I can‚Äôt stop and I hate my life and wanna die but can‚Äôt end myself so fuck you
"Was already depressed, then my father died","I‚Äôve never lost someone this close to me before. It‚Äôs hard to tell the difference between my normal depression level and what is added on to that from this loss. It wasn‚Äôt a sudden unexpected death, so maybe that made it a little easier. I cried a couple of times thinking about him, but most of the time I‚Äôm just depressed like usual. It‚Äôs been a couple of weeks now. I‚Äôm not really sure if I‚Äôve actually mourned his death. I just feel empty inside, but that‚Äôs my normal state."
Dealing with parents who refuse to understand your depression?,"I'm honestly so tired. I feel like a shitty child. They've been stressed out because of me. It makes me feel worse and I feel like there is no hope left. I can't snap out of it... I've tried to explain them but they refuse to understand.
This is an edit after A week: Guys... I told my dad about the severity after pursuing them... :') He will come to meet my doctor"
"Cant get motivated to do anything, even shower","I'm going through my first very difficult breakup after 12 years of marriage to a man who is my best friend and who knows me (and I him) better than anyone, he's been my other half for so long, and he was my first relationship ever. 

I am living with my parents while I try to basically start my life over, on my own, and my depression has almost completely engulfed me.

There are a lot of days where I can hardly motivate myself to get dressed, let alone shower or other basic tasks. I try to go outside and at least take a walk but even motivating myself into doing that is like pulling teeth.

I've been thinking of making a couple lists for me to check off each morning so I can at least get a routine down. I need to find a job and start being productive so I start feeling better about myself and my situation.
"
I miss enjoying my hobbies,"For a while now, I've had very low energy and motivation to do things I used to love. Reading, drawing, painting, playing the piano... I just dont have interest in engaging in my hobbies anymore. But I want to be able to enjoy them again!

I've tried scheduling time to do some of these things each week, but it has just made me dread doing them even more, as if they were more chores. 

I'm interested to hear what techniques and skills worked for you to be able to enjoy life again."
my boyfriend is the only thing keeping me sane and i think he is getting tired of me,"im in a long distance relationship with the most beautiful boy ive ever met. i love him so much and things were great. but lately my mental state has been deteriorizing more and more. lately i started to have severe panick attacks. when im feeling bad talking to him makes me calm down. but lately i can feel im draining his energy everytime i hit him up to talk about how much i hate myself and how much im sorry. im not telling this to him because it would be guilt tripping as fuck, but if he leaves me i will be left with literally nothing, and just the thought of it makes me fucking scared.

 i dont know what to do. i wanna get better for him, but it seems impossible. nothing i tried has worked, and im desperate."
I just feel so disgusting,I feel like nobody will ever love me. I keep giving love but nothing comes back. I keep trying to find someone. Every guy that comes my way that I like ends up flirting with me and then revealing they have a gf or they‚Äôre catfishing me. I seem so hopeless and ugly. I feel just so bad. I just can‚Äôt win. I feel my heartbreaking everyday when I watch the one guy I truly love be with his girlfriend. I don‚Äôt even cry anymore because I know it does nothing but just make me feel even worse. I‚Äôm drifting away

_________________________

I‚Äôm someone that never knew that I struggled with depression my whole life as a kid. It was just chalked up to something that was just me being sad. Turns out, far from that fact. As someone that is a Christian, I didn‚Äôt know it today/tonight?, but I was given Divine Intervention. I love music and just a song came to mind for me, ‚ÄúI Can Only Imagine‚Äù. That song to me just summarized everything I‚Äôve been feeling for as long as I can remember at least 10-15 years of suffering, gone. I‚Äôm dedicating my life now to serving everyone afflicted by this and know that you can get help. I know that for a lot of people it‚Äôs hard: trust me, I bloody know. The darkness is temporary. The light shines bright. I‚Äôm signing myself up for a Gym Membership and going today when I wakeup, I‚Äôm going to start doing things that I like that bring value to me. Ok ramble over. Chat with me in the comments please. Love you all even though I just stumbled upon this subreddit today."
Am i the only one who still ‚Äúacts like a child‚Äù ?,"When I get overwhelmed/anxious/panic mode , lately i‚Äôve been resulting in like scream-crying. I don‚Äôt know why all of a sudden my normal semi-quiet cries have turned me into a screaming mess. I feel like a child again. I used to have these temper tantrums when i was a kid-flail on the couch & tense my muscles with frustration. I thought i had grown out of that a bit ago but it seems to be back.. I‚Äôm a highly sensitive person so anything can set me off into tears-which is my bodies way of releasing the stress i hold in. But it‚Äôs just so frustrating. I just like scream cry of frustration because i can‚Äôt like let something go, i don‚Äôt even know. When a bad thought is on my mind, or even an expectation that i don‚Äôt believe i can accomplish/seems to hard to complete, i just get so frustrated that i can‚Äôt accept it or take it not as negative as i did, so i like scream and crying for like 20minutes-which if you have ever done, is pretty dehydrating. And when i‚Äôm in that ‚Äúzone‚Äù it‚Äôs like i can‚Äôt even think to help myself, i just feed into the emotions i feel. It‚Äôs like i kinda go crazy for a bit, then after i have that guilty shameful feeling of feeling like i acted so childlike & weal & incapable of helping myself. 

Is this a normal response to someone who has been depressed & anxious daily for the past 10 years ? (i‚Äôve been in&out of therapy since then too)

What‚Äôs another stress outlet besides crying? (like taking a walk or drawing is not considered a stress outlet for me because it actually causes me more stress; ex- walking outside in public makes me SO anxious/stressed cuz of my social anxiety) plus it doesn‚Äôt seem like it ‚Äúreleases‚Äù any stress because i don‚Äôt feel a relief, i just feel the same.."
"I'm getting better, and I wanted to let you know that","I've had depression for about seven or so years now, with some up and down periods. I think my oficial first diagnose was in 2015, and since then I tried getting professional help. The first few times didn't work very well, and I would end up dropping the medication.

The last treatment I've been on, however, seems to be working. I'm not as blindly optimistic as to say ""I'm cured!"" because no, of course I'm not. I still have problems, I still have consequences of those years of sickness that I have to work hard to overcome. But, for the first time in so, so long, I have hope that I can do it. I can finally see a light at the end of this awfully dark path, and I feel like I can reach it one day.

This post is not to give you a definite solution to your problem, though. Each case is different, and what works for me may not be helpful at all for you (I mean specific things, like the meds I'm taking) Instead, what I want to offer is the same hope I feel right now. I want to share it with you, because I've been where you are, I've felt like you feel now, and I know what it is to think you'll never get better, like ""well, this is my life now, I guess I'll just suffer until I die"". I know that feeling oh so well, and it pains me to think about those days when I felt like that. And I know many of you feel that way right now.

I want to share my hope with you. I want to tell you that I'm not a ""lucky one"" that magically got better. There were years of struggles. I tried different treatments, I visited different doctors, I took different medications. It has been a long process of trial and error. Along the line bad things have happened in my life; a few years ago I lost my grandmother, and I've also buried four of my cats (they are like my babies to me, you'll understand if you have pets). My life is not perfect and rose colored. So it's okay if yours isn't either.

The only advice I can give you is that you keep trying. Get help, both professional and from family and/or friends. Also places like this sub. Just because we're a bunch of strangers in the internet, it doesn't mean you can't ask us for help. There will always be a hand there to help you, even if you can't see it, even if you don't believe anyone will care. That's your illness talking. There is always someone to help you.

And finally, with enough time and help, I hope you can get better. Just like I am. 

Thanks for reading. Best wishes! <3"
I feel guilty for being depressed,"Every single time i open my eyes and feel overweily empty like i have no reason to do anything i feel so much guilt about it. Like this whole stigma ""you have x so you should not feel sad"" hurts me a lot since i believe that. And when for the first time i felt like this is really gone, i found my own little happiness in life, there is no way i will feel like that again it just hit me again. When i set myself goal to not hurt myself because someone loves me at first i was like obvious to me, so easy, all i have to do to be kind to myself and now i wanna break down to tears. And the worst is that i don't wanna talk about it to someone important to me because again, i feel guilty for bothering them with my insignificant problems compared to them.  I know i should visit psychiatric about that but where i live it all goes down to ""Oh so your parents are divorced therefore you miss your father. Give me 50$"". Like... ???. Thank's i'm cured now. And i really do not want to fully open to complete stranger to me and tell my story in nutshell. I know this feeling comes and then goes away (and then comes back), i think i got most of it figured out. It's just later in years of my life it gets more sad and i can't believe i dare to think and feel like when got this and that.   
Thanks for letting me to rant here a bit. At least i got someplace to let my feelings out without getting worried i waste someone's time."
Guy I have been dating 2 years opened up about depression after 2 years and then disappeared??,"Hi all,

This is my first post, I am totally new to the Reddit community! So, I have been dating someone truly special to me the last couple years, and he has had a few depressive spirals since about a year into things. The most he would reveal after I would ask to get together, is that he was in a bad head space where he couldn't get out of bed sometimes and felt hopeless and as though he was in a hole. He is a very social and outgoing guy, so obviously this was very out of character for him, but I never wanted to pry or push him to talk about it, and would just offer my support and understanding and let him know I was there if he needed anything. When we would see each other next, he'd not speak a word about it, only ever opened up in a lengthy text about what was going on with him.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to a couple months ago, I tried to make plans for a Friday night, he happily agreed, and then the next night cancelled, saying he was super depressed, couldnt get out of bed, and never wanted to leave the house again. I gave him space and he asked to go out 5 days later. We went to dinner and he completely opened up about his illness, revealed he has experienced it on occasion for the last 3 years, and admitted he had a borderline suicidal thought for the first time. Like he understood why people take their own lives. He was so incredibly open and vulnerable about it, I was so proud of him. Afterwards, thinking I felt closer to him than ever before, I went out of town, came back and asked to get together, only to have him disappear. He Would take 24 hours to respond to texts, wouldnt see me. He eventually texted me saying we should just be friends but meet up and talk. Its been incredibly difficult to get him to follow through on this.

&#x200B;

Im devastated. Is he embarrassed he revealed so much? Did he change his mind about me? I miss him and want to understand."
THEY THINK ITS A JOKE,everyone in class says things like oh thats depressing i'm so depressed i'm going to kill myself ect and its annoying they think its a joke and one girl cut her finger with sicssors because she saw it on tic tok and that is dumb do you know ppl who do/say dumb things like that
5 useful tips for depression,"So we all have those days when our depresion is worse, perhaps we haven‚Äôt left our house for while, we haven‚Äôt slept properly or too much and food is going out window or too much.. 

Here are some things have helped me

1. Idoser - i listen to idoser every time I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed or simply want to escape reality for while..
2. Listen to music and podcasts, no matter what you are interested in whether you love music, your favourite radio show. 
3. Exercise - exercise is probably the last thing you want to doing you are feeling depressed.. but it can be your best friend and better way of coping.
4. If you find the groups that nhs/council runs for depressed people to meet other depressed people is not your thing. Bunk them off and find something else.. if else fails use the net.
5. Get into nootropics, we all love that we‚Äôve accomplished things but often our depression has clouded that judgement and we cannot focus but we‚Äôve got that mountain of paper work sitting on our desk.. google nootropics and order order  a bottle or two, get some from Holland & Barrett 
6. Do you have a hobby you love, perhaps think about getting one or two that suits you and suits your personality. There‚Äôs no point in joining a sports group if you hate socialising or too anxious/depressed or paying out a subscription fee if you don‚Äôt use it..
7. Feeling lonely and isolated, go on PenPal sites, chatrooms, forums and meet people that way.. that way you don‚Äôt have to worry too much if they disappear you can go and find someone else. Less effort required.. you don‚Äôt have to panic every time. Are they gonna turn up?? You can turn your computer on or your mobile any time of the day and get chatting.
8. Make use of that button your mobile called ‚Äúdo not disturb,‚Äù we all have those days when don‚Äôt feel like talking or we simply want to binge watch that new drama in peace and don‚Äôt want to be interrupted, make use of do not disturb and turn your notifications off. I did this last week, I didn‚Äôt give a rats about every day problems, daily grind of life, i had done the activities I wanted to do for the day..and I simply had it with life.. so I did it and felt lots better. The group was bunked, told em had flu, switched on that games console, shoved my mobile on do not disturb, let the bugger rundown it‚Äôs battery so even if flashes I didn‚Äôt see it and a holiday from life.. "
Just a reminder : you can be yourself,"You should never feel bad for doing something that makes you happy or helps you cope, (provided, of course, it doesn‚Äôt harm yourself or others).


I don‚Äôt care if you like pumpkin spice. 

I don‚Äôt care if you like to screech like an autistic kid. 

I don‚Äôt care if you make shitty arts / crafts. 

I don‚Äôt care if you dance in the shower like an idiot. 

I don‚Äôt care if you like leopard print stretchy pants. 




Find whatever gives you a shred of fucking happiness in this world. Take it and run and fuck anyone who judges you for it.

People always tell you to get therapy or to get help.,"Yeah like I just walk up to the hospital and say ""one therapy please"" I don't know anything about this shit. Where do I go? What do I ask for? Do I have to pay for it? I can barely afford food. How the actual f am I supposed to just go get help? This wasnt taught in school people. I dont know what to look for. And god knows that Google cant answer anything more specific than what day of the week is it. It's hard if you're the type who is easily overwhelmed you know? My brain gets fried every time I think about it.

Edit: Thanks for all the support guys. There's a lot of stuff out there I didnt even know existed. I really appreciate your help."
In need of friends,"I'm a 27 year old woman. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I have very little family, my boyfriend and son. I have no real friends and need help making some. Sometimes I go into a dark place and just need to talk. If no one responds I get it. I just want to make friends somehow."
I Don't Want to Talk About It,"I am depressed. I live a joyless life. I don't want to kill myself but I don't really see the point in living.

I keep seeing ads or public service announcements with celebrities that say: ""Do you want to talk about it?"" ""Find someone to talk to."" ""I'm here for you to talk to."" My problem is that I don't want to talk about it. I am ashamed. I feel weak and incapable of solving my own problems. I feel like my life is objectively great with no real reason to feel this way. I don't want to whine, I don't want to dwell.

But I do recognize that talking about it has to happen if anything is going to get better.

The people close to me clearly see there's a problem and inquire. My default response is: ""I don't want to talk about it."" Or I ignore the question. Or I change the subject.

How do I get over this hurdle of being able to talk about this with anyone?"
"I'm feeling down, can somebody just chat a little?","I'm trying to manage this ""cold"" feeling of unexplained sadness, and talk a little help, if somebody want to talk, ask for something, I'm just feeling a bit lonely"
Feeling so depressed to the point where I'm contemplating calling out of work (again) tomorrow to get real help.,"I'm struggling pretty hard right now with depression and anxiety. I could barely do anything today with how fatigued I am. My insurance is also running out on the 31st. I know I need to take time to figure out what's going on, but at the same time I can't afford to lose my job if I need time away. I just need support right now. My energy is nonexistent."

I am so tired,"I have entered this on a different subreddit, but no one seems to be too responsive (besides one person who I am really thankful for). I want to hear more from others....I'm a very introverted person, and I'm smart. I know what I should do to get help, I know what the sources of my problems are, I know what I have to do. But I am so tired.

To make a long story short, I was emotionally, physically, verbally, and sexually abused for the first eleven years of my life, and now I am adopted by my godparents, who I highly respect as my mother and father.Anyways, like I said, I'm a private person. This means people say things to me without thinking how I might feel about it. I also do not share my past memories with others- I need to move on. I cannot blame them for their ignorance, that would be rude.  So when people get mad, and yell at me, I leave my face blank and take it. But it's been hard lately. When my mom gets upset with me, practically anything that leaves my mouth is talking back or an excuse. It makes me feel like her scolding me about being ungrateful means I don't deserve what she gives me- that I don't deserve a loving mother, I deserve what I had, and that my feelings are excuses. But I take it, and I bounce back.Those outside of family know me as a happy, innocent, smart, and responsible person. If I am ever anything except some state of happy, people think it's weird of me. Because I always get back on my feet without them knowing I fell. But I am so tired of getting back up. Of forgiving everyone that has hurt me over and over. Of taking all of those offensive comments silently. Of fulfilling the expectations of those around me when I already expect perfection out of myself. Of trying to put effort into my appearance only to look at my own hands and feel revolted. Of acting. Of not feeling good enough for anyone.**I sometimes wish I had a normal life, but look back on it and would rather it be me than anyone else. And I want someone to see that. To not think I am vein or naive, instead looking into me. Looking at my pain, my struggles, my scars, my fighting, and be grateful. To hold me and say it was worth it, that I am strong. To let my tears fall, and look me in the eyes and say ""thank you"".**"
Do you ever just feel lonely,Lonely to the point you feel like you have no one or no one can truly understand your pain or you. Yeah I understand everybody has pain. But do you ever feel soo lost in yourself you don't even know who you are anymore. So dayum lost even the person who you thought you could trust the most would never betray you and hurt you that way. I don't know what life is for me anymore. I feel so lost in who I am. I just wanna sleep forever
Intrusive Thoughts - My Technique For Banishing Them,"Crossposted from Depression.

OK, first off, I am not a doctor. I'm just a guy who has been dealing with his own depression for the last 40+ years.

One of my most persistent symptoms is the host of intrusive thoughts I get. Specifically, the ones where your brain makes you ruminate on painful or embarrassing things that happened in your past. It's like you can't help but have to sit there and relive it over and over again. It's been the toughest thing for me to get rid of.

Anyway, I finally realized that I needed to break the cycle, and...to make along story short...I have a technique that actually seems to work. I've been using it for the past couple of months, and for this particular symptom, it seems to work pretty well.

First off, the tough parts. You have to be **willing** to stop the cycle...you can get addicted to it without realizing it. Then, you have to start **realizing** that you are doing it, and try to realize it *as close to the moment that you start doing it*. I'm not kidding when I say that this is the toughest part, mostly because it means diverting your behavior into something that is new to you (which is never easy). If you can do this, you really are halfway there.

Next, you tell yourself that you don't have to live in that moment, but instead have to live in the NOW. Nobody can change the past, so you don't need to worry about it anymore. Nobody is keeping score but you, and you don't have any reason to continue doing it. This should be a little bit jarring, like it's shaking you awake, but embrace the startling aspect of it.

Finally, in this moment...distract yourself. Look for anything else to think about besides the intrusive thought that you were thinking about originally. This will keep you from immediately sliding back into the old pattern. I have found that, for me, thinking of a bunch of shallow topics in succession will do the trick. ""That's a pretty tree. Hey, I'm coming up on Main Street. That car has Florida plates. My feet are very warm right now. There's a grade school. I wonder what their mascot is."" ...You get the idea. Keep it up for a full minute if you can.

That's it, that's all there is to it. It took longer to explain it than it typically takes to do it (once you get good at realizing when it happens).

Maybe this has been done before, and the technique has already been invented. I honestly don't know, nor is it particularly important to me. I just want to put this out there in the hope that it might help someone else like it helped me."
"The loneliness is suffocating me and it feels like no one is ever going to decide I‚Äôm the person they‚Äôve been looking for, plus horrible upbringing for maximum sad.","My mom died of cancer when I was in high school and for every other example of this scenario playing out in my school district the student in that situation was treated better than normal and given an easy path through the year. Not me, I was treated like garbage and that wore away at a lot of my confidence. Now I miss my mom because it‚Äôs been years and even though a couple months ago I was able to buy a house at 24 it feels so empty, I live with my best friend and yet it doesn‚Äôt feel the same. It‚Äôs not waking up in the middle of the night with your significant other resting on your shoulder. It‚Äôs not the late night talks about the future and all the dumb thoughts that come to mind when no one else matters but each other. I miss the fighting, I miss feeling alive with someone else. I‚Äôm never an option to anyone, I just get looked past like I‚Äôm no one and it stings. I just want to feel needed. If you have  heard Love Falls by Hellyeah, the lyrics speak to me on a level that‚Äôs rare. I‚Äôm miserable and I hate that I have to keep walking because I‚Äôm ready to throw in the towel."
Anyone else just bloody exhausted?,"I am exhausted. I have spent the last 2 years clawing my way out of the pit of depression and it always feels like I just fall back in. It feels unfair and it hits me harder and harder every time. I go to therapy, try medication, change my diet, monitor my sleep,  download fucking apps, change therapists look for the best people in the field and I am still here feeling like shit and unable to shake thoughts about ending it all. I am over it. I feel broken and hopeless. I don't feel like I'll ever be better.   
Does anyone ever \*actually\* recover????"
Feeling very suicidal and really need some support please.,"Hi. I'm not really able to explain everything right now, but I have an enormous amount of mh problems that I've had for as long as I can remember. I crashed a bit today again - keeps happening a lot recently - but I found myself thinking to take all my pills and overdose to die. This is not okay, and I haven't felt this bad for years. I'm not going to do it, but I feel like I really want to. I have no irl support nearby, as I'm stuck in a country I'm not from and cannot go home. And obviously lockdown doesn't help. I have tried to commit suicide in the past so I know I am capable of it, but I don't actually want  to. I just want to not hurt so much, and I want to go home. All the stress I'm experiencing is quite literally breaking my body and brain, physically and emotionally. I know it could always be worse, but I am absolutely desperate. I have no idea what to do. I am hyperventilating and crying nonstop and having a complete meltdown. Please help."
The current situation has caused a HUGE setback,"Hey everyone. I hope you are doing better during this crazy time than I am. 

A bit of background: I'm a California girl in my 50's. And, I've struggled for 20 years to fight off very intense anxiety and depression. I have been unable to work since 2014. I've got a claim for SSDI, but apparently I'm not sick enough. SMH   I married my high school sweetheart May of 2018. He was the one that got away. I was never happier. After choosing the wrong guys all my life, I finally choose the right guy! Then in October he fell ill with an unknown lung disease. By the 21st of December I lost my love, my best friend he just couldn't breathe anymore. He put up a valiant fight.

I was immediately hospitalized in the psych unit. I was overwhelmed with grief. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with him. I even tried several times to make that happen. And to add fuel too the fire, my dad passed away three months after my husband. I'm not ashamed to say I was Daddy's Little Girl. And I miss him just as much as my husband.

So, for a whole year I struggled and fight my depression and anxiety. In that year, I was hospitalized 10 times, for psych and other ailments I have. But sometime after the 1 year mark when he died, I kinda just came out of the fog. I was feeling so much better, reaching out to his mom and other friends. I was so glad that I was gonna beat this. 

Fast forward to the present. I am an isolater by nature, so this covid-19 situation I know I can get through it. I have one good friend and my mother-in-law for support. I keep my appointments with my psychiatrist, and take my meds as prescribed.
I have no income, since I have to go through the entire process with Social Security before I can qualify to receive spousal benefits. Basically, what he was earning. Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, I'll never go hungry. So since I'm disabled, waiting for benefits, my rent is $50/month. I also had internet shut off because I couldn't pay them (just $50 too. My needs are small) I've had help from friends and family, and then eventually from several local church charities.

 And, well, I've run out of options and was scrolling through Reddit. I saw a couple of subs in which to ask for help. So I took a deep breath and posted how I need help paying my bills. The only reason I did this is that I have seen many messages of gratitude from individuals who received help. But that didn't happen for me. In fact there were some negative responses, and both posts where completely down voted. So, I guess either I don't know how to ask for help, or people just don't care. Let's add to my situation that my one good friend is going through some of their own challenges, and being a complete jerk. I've heard that the economic stimulus package won't pay anyone who is not working. Figures, the people who need it the most get nothing. And I pray it is only a rumour, because $1000 could set me up for many months while I work on my disability claim. The California Governor has issued a ""shelter in place"" order. I have asthma pretty badly, so I'm party of the group that SERIOUSLY shouldn't go out. Same with my mother-in-law.

My anxiety and depression had returned in full force. I have thought, again of giving up on my life. There is really NOTHING good about it. At all. My sister has shunned me because she knows nothing about mental health, and thinks I should just ""be happy."" I've never really had any meaningful relationship with my mom. She has been emotionally unavailable my entire life. 

So what am I left with? A complete shut down. No news, or Internet. (I'm typing on my government phone which has very limited data. But at least I can post) My friend is unavailable. Yesterday I went to my mother-in-law's place so I could download some movies. It's really exasperating to be so helpless, and so tired of my f**ked up life, and so sad, and no real prospects in paying my measly $100/month bills. And when I reach out, it either goes sideways or I am ignored. I can't eat or I get very nauseous (die to my anxiety and a medical issue with my stomach.

Why don't I deserve the help I really need? I literally have nothing to live for. And I don't know what to do."
I hate my brain,"Basicaly the situation is like this:

Me: ahh seems for a day at least my brain gave me some breath from everything and i can have a decent day

My brain 1 millisecond later: HEY HOW ABOUT I STUN YOU AND MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GUITLY DEPRESSED AND IN ANXHIETY

Me: I hate this brain


ye this is my situation now plus i want to listen to my sad playlist but i don't feel to listen to it at the same time..."
Overthinking is killing me,"I have always been shy, and was recently diagnosed with severe social anxiety. I have also been depressed for about 3 years now, after I had been bullied by some "" friends "" in middle school, 7th grade. 8th grade was even worse, I had lost all my friends, and had turned into a loner. My freshman year was the same, and the teachers even started to pick on me. That's when I left, and decided to stay at home and do online school. Both of my parents are hard working, so they couldn't stay home with me, so I had absolutely no motivation at all to work on school, and barely passed. I am now a Sophomore and only have online friends. I overthink EVERYTHING to the point where I can't even text my friends online anymore, because I worry I will say something weird. It has never gotten this bad, I used to be funny, and I didn't overthink as much. I was almost outgoing. I don't know what to do. I've tried talking to a few therapists before, but it has never helped and i am not sure about any medications. It is really hard for me to post this, but I need some help.

Thank you so much to everyone who responded to this. After seeing all of your comments I felt very relieved and not alone. I have been doing much better after typing this. So thank you again, knowing I am not alone helped me a lot. (:"

I want to talk to my ex because I want to feel the way he loved me again. But I know he hates me too, or doesn't even think about me anyway.
I want someone to just hug me and let me cry in their arms. But I know I fucked things up and nobody can't stand me now.

Anyone feeling like a vulnerable child?,"I‚Äôm 28f and struggling with both depression and anxiety. I have a lot of problems, but  something especially bothers me these days. I feel like a little girl who needs to be taken care of. I am scared of the outside world. I am an adult, I thought I was a strong woman but the depression and anxiety made me feel like a vulnerable, needy little child. I wasn‚Äôt always like that. I graduated from university, have worked in an important institution for 3 years. Then I had to quit and my life changed completely. I got depressed and extremely anxious. Now I lost my set-esteem. I feel hopeless and weak. Does anyone feel like that because of depression?Does it get better? What should I do?"
I feel so helpless and I want to be unconscious so bad,Something happened and I‚Äôve never felt this low in my life I feel like everyone expects so much of me and I feel like I will never be good enough to make them happy and to meet their expectations of me .  Feel like I can‚Äôt live this life . I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just don‚Äôt want to be alive right now. I can‚Äôt avoid these things that‚Äôs happening in my life I can‚Äôt ignore it but I can‚Äôt keep living through them. I am shaking right now I don‚Äôt know waht to do anymore. I feel so lost. I jsut want to feel peace and not worry so much for once but I can‚Äôt do that. Thank for letting me vent. It feels good to vent.
My boyfriend just told me out of nowhere he woke up and was sad he was still alive.,"And when I say out of nowhere I really mean it. He had never shown any signs of being that negative before... and then he essentially has heart failure and lands up in hospital a few hours later.

I had no idea it was that bad. I thought we were working through the occasional negative thoughts and getting better.

I have no idea what to do or how to help. I just want him to be okay"
Loneliness,"It has come to the point in my life, where I just feel lonely. I know that there are people close to me, that there are people who care about me, but sometimes, I just feel lonely. I usually enjoy the feeling of being alone. I love sitting at a bench in the middle of nowhere in the darkest of night, when noone is around and nobody but the stars sees me.
But I hate this loneliness... It creeps into me like a dagger, slowly pushed into my heart, wraps my brain and emotions in a blanket of coldness, softly whispering in my ear that I'm alone...that no one really cares about me...
I can fight against it, I can entertain myself to not feel it. I can figth it by talking to people, by making silly jokes or watching YouTube or playing video games.
But sometimes, in the middle of the day, it comes creeping back to me.
It seems to be around me all the time, just waiting for the moment, I let my guard down... Just waiting to close its hands around my throat and rip my heart right out of my chest... Dragging me down into an ice cold sea of nothingness and loneliness.

I know this demon of loneliness is wrong. I know, that there are people who care for me and who like me... But still, I don't know how to win against this demon."
"(22F) Under the poverty line, don't know how to apply for assistance or what I would qualify for, need help navigating the system because my head keeps spinning (NOT asking for money, just need help getting some)"," 

((I'm new to reddit, and this is a throwaway account, so please forgive me if I committed any reddit faux pas))

I need help- not direct financial aid, but help navigating the system. I know I should qualify for financial help, but I have no idea how to go about it or which programs to pursue.

I'm scraping by, deep in student loan & hospital debt that I can't afford to pay because I can barely make rent, trying to save up for a super-cheap, used, under $1,000 car so I can get a better job (I currently work retail part time and take painting & illustration commissions part time), but I'm exhausted even working the few hours that I do (thanks, brain). I've been struggling with depression & anxiety since my freshman year of college (2015), culminating in a suicide attempt & an involuntary stay in a mental hospital a little over two years ago. I can't afford counseling, and I can't get medication without a car. It's been a while since I've been on meds. Not sure I would be able to afford it if I could reach it. I was raised in a cult-like Christian conservative homeschooling home, so until college I was very isolated from modern culture, ""common"" sense, and a normal view of the world. Because of this, I have no idea how social programs work. I'm still scrambling to figure out how the normal world works. I tried applying to Modest Needs, was told I made too little to qualify, started looking at government programs, and got just absolutely completely lost.

Any suggestions for ways to make/earn/get money welcome as well, just keep in mind I don't have a lot of energy at the moment...

Has anyone who's had similar struggles in the past have any advice? Any resources? A suggestion for a place to start?

...

Other possibly relevant details about me:

\-I know that my income places me solidly under the poverty line

\-I think I may have ADHD or something similar but have never been evaluated for it

\-I was \*\*\*VERY\*\*\* briefly homeless, slept in a tree at one point and in my car (had to sell) another, but there's no documentation of that (it was remarkably short, I'm very lucky)

\-I live in California & I am a US citizen

\-I am cis, pansexual, female, & white as a ream of printer paper

\-I was disowned & cut off by my family for religious reasons

\-I have some, small documentation of my mental illnesses, but because of those same mental illnesses, I can't make it to a doctor often, so the paper trail is inconsistent, spotty at best

\-I was in college 3 years, was in my senior year (I brought in credits) when I ran out of money and had to leave, never graduated

\-I pay rent under-the-table, I don't \*legally\* reside at the place I live

\-I have terrible credit- lots of student and medical debt, I've never had a credit card but I've been wondering if getting one might help

\-I've never applied for any governmental assistance before (aside from scholarships)

I can't think of any other details that might be relevant but feel free to ask any questions, aside from this protective anonymity I'm an open book.

Thanks so much to anyone who took the time to read <3"
I've all but given up on this life,"UPDATE: Thank you all do much, we had a conversation tonight and we agreed to separate. It was a wonderful to years, but she needs to heal properly before we can go on. I'm also going to get help. I feel better tonight than I did this morning and I think that's important.



I'm only 19. I understand that if I get through this there will be so much life to be had, but things are starting to look bleak. My best friend/girlfriend is dying. She has Ehlos Danlers Syndrome, arrhythmia, and those are both being made worse by the fact that she's developed anorexia nervosa. She's withering away and it's killing me. I haven't gotten out of bed for anything other than work for a half a week. I've been severely depressed my entire life, but this is the first time that I've wanted to kill myself. Not that I want to not exist, but I fully want to kill myself. I need help."
"Does anyone else feel to shit to ""be human"" ?","I was walking with a friend and i was feeling terrible and she was talking abiut things a ""human"" would smile, laugh, or at least give any kind of facial and or vocal expression, and usually i at least pretend to smile etc.
but today i felt way to bad and i usually responded with ""mhm"" ,""uhuh"", (those without even opening my mouth cuz thats top much work apparently) or the bare and absolute minimum of words to express that im still listening.  
And she asked ""you good?"" and obviously because i was feeling so very not good and desperatly want help i answered ""yea, yea""."
Guess I'm alone,"As the title suggests, no one gets me.

Im a 16 year old male who gets mediocre grades due to the fact he doesn't study. I have no gf as no one would care about my shitty face/body or childish personality.

My own family critizises me for not studying hard enough while I wake up every day feeling like shit.

Some time ago I tried to cheer myself up and started writing 5 reasons to live every day I woke up. I can't even write two of 'em.

No one knows about this as the first time I talked about it I felt worse for the reaction of my parents and how broken they were while in treatment than the actual depression. Even if I didn't get any better, everyday I would act a little better until the psychologist said I was ok, even if I was only acting (look, one thing I'm good at. Took me 16 years to realise).

This ks my second one and the only reason I wake up everyday without ending my life is because, the only thing I really care about was what would happen to my parents if I not only died, but killed myself.

If you have read this far, just want to thank you for taking your time to read through my sh*t.

Hope you get something more entertaining to do from now on ;).

The worst part: I play videogames all day because they are the only place I feel I can be myself without anyone complaining (my parents think telling me I'm useless will help get better and want to improve myself). And they now want to take them off me saying that I play way too much. Guess it won't be long until I finally explode."
I want to give up on life,"I'm completely exhausted. I have no motivation to do anything in life anymore. 

The only things I feel like doing are sleeping, being on my phone, and eating. Even then, nothing actually brings me pleasure or happiness. I can't even put effort into anything anymore because I become so distracted and everything feels so hopeless so I procrastinate so much. 

Just thinking about what to write on this post is hard but I really really want to vent so much but I just cant explain it all. In school my grades are suffering because I end up missing school a lot, either due to depression or panic attacks. 

All I wanna do in life is sleep and eat and use the internet, I used to have so many interests, for example, drawing and gaming. I would draw all the time and was really into improving my art, but these days it feels like such hard work even getting a piece of paper out. When i start up my favourite games, it's sometimes hard to even play one round (like in splatoon) because it feels so pointless and repetitive. 

Everything just feels like a chore to be honest. A lot of the time it feels painful, like emotionally painful, just to wake up, a mixed feeling of dread and sadness and fear and disappointment. 

This post most likely will not be noticed but these are just my feelings and I really really need advice I guess."
Anyone care to share their experience with MAOIs?,"Have been through most of the ssris, all the snris. After years of messing about with meds I finally got a result with Wellbutrin, but there's a supply issue now in Australia and it won't be available here till 2020. I'm getting pretty bad without meds so thought I might try maois. Would be interested to hear about effectiveness -or not - side effects, and dietary issues. Thanks."
How do I motivate myself to start reading again?,"Hi! So this has been an issue I‚Äôve been struggling with for a few years now, but I have a really hard time reading and completing books. It‚Äôs annoying because it‚Äôs like my ‚Äúsoul‚Äù really wants to read more, like how I used to, but obviously depression is a big roadblock to that. I always find myself turning on the TV instead even when I know reading would make me feel better. Anyways, I was just wondering if anyone had any advice with trying to get myself into the headspace to pick up a book more often instead of throwing on the TV."
I feel nothing,"My brother's murderer was brought to justice yesterday and was found guilty. The initial relief that washed over me left me feeling ecstatic. Now it has worn away, along with the trial anxiety, and I am left feeling nothing. This is the biggest nothing I have ever felt in my entire life. I keep dissociating for hours on end and it is the most bizarre thing. I really just need to know that I am going to be okay. "
I get very depressed whenever I am faced with difficult decisions. Does anyone know what I could do to reduce this?,"I know this sounds like a ‚Äúfirst world problem‚Äù, but, for example, I have been offered a new job at a different company. I won‚Äôt go into details but there are many pros and cons for both accepting the job and staying where I am. I am very indecisive and the pressure of the decision is crippling me.

I know it sounds stupid but the pain and pressure caused by this (and other similar decisions) has become so overwhelming I can‚Äôt stand it. I won‚Äôt do it, but it almost feels like suicide is a better alternative than living life through painful decision after painful decision.

Why do I feel this way?

"
My husband found an app that was designed to help fight depression...,"It's called SuperBetter. It includes quests,  ""bad guys"", leveling up... 

It seems interesting.  I figured I'd share it with you all in case you want to try it out.  We are supposed to have allies in the app. IDK what the allies are meant to do,  but I'll be yours if you need one.  My name the is HuzzardBuzzard. If you can't find me there,  PM me here. I've barely used SuperBetter, so I have very little understanding of how it works. 

ETN: allies don't work this way.  Looks like they are real life people, not in-app people. "
Messed up college and now stuck in life. No idea how to get out of this hell.,"This has been very stressful. I tried two years of college but it was just way too heavy for me mentally. I thought I could handle it but I was absolutely wrong. I've lost lots of credits and not even sure whether I can try again in the future. I'm even too scared to call for information. My parents don't know about this. Not even my friends. Everyone keeps asking how I'm doing in uni but I don't wanna be judged so I keep it to myself and say that everything's perfectly fine. I'm planning to work this summer but no idea what I'm going to do the next year(s). I don't want to be living paycheck to paycheck and struggling just because my depression messed up my future. I don't know what to do and this has been killing me for the past few months.  


Edit: Thanks everyone for the wonderful replies. I'm sorry it took me a week to check the replies but somehow I was a bit scared. There's a lot that I have to work on but you guys gave me some great advice I'll take to hear. Thank you so much!"
My Spirit broke for the first time,"I found myself stuck in a deep dark hole covered with the thought that everything was fine.

Someone pulled me out of that hole, and i realized how bad I was before I met her. I never thought i was hurting that much.

But she gave me things to be happy about, and for the first time in a long time i felt real happiness. Not the fake ‚Äúyour fine‚Äù my brain tells me everyday, true happiness. 

Turns out it was a lie as well.
She pulled me out, just to spit on my face and throw me back down.

Now im doing something i‚Äôve never done, listen to sad music and think about my situation. 

Then when i realized how fucking hopeless i was i felt my spirit split in two. One side desperately trying to pull itself back together, while the other wants nothing but death.

I feel like a lot of other people feel this way, but i seriously don‚Äôt know what to do with myself.

I don‚Äôt expect anyone to respond to this, or even read this far. But i need something to distract myself from the pain."
Thank you for reading.,"Hey,

I don't know if anyone is going to read this or not, but if you do, thank you.

I haven't been on a date in two years, been intimate with someone in 3, I know that doesn't matter and it doesn't matter to me that much. But it feels nice to be attracted to in some way. Every single girl in the past two years has ghosted me. Every. Single. One. I tried paying for tinder, paying for match, paying for bumble, and clover. Tinder is kind of a joke but I'm just saying I tried them all. I went out and tried to meet people in bars, games, events. I've had a woman look me up and down and say ""ew"" and walk away after I tried to talk to her. I don't know, the biggest thing I want in life is a loving wife and beautiful children. And I may only be 22 but I want that long relationship where there is nothing but love, started at a young age. I don't want to be 50 finding my soulmate. But nowadays people see one thing they don't like about you and they just assume the relationship will never work.

I've lost several friends this year because of how things have changed. My friends also ended up trying to make plans without me and hide the fact they were hanging out, most of the time it was because they wanted to smoke, and I dont. And my work has me travel, often, and for at least a few weeks at a time several states away and I can't go out and spend time with friends or family, because I don't know anyone and there aren't any co-workers nearby because they usually send me to areas where they have no one. And it just amplifies the depression and started to develop insomnia because of my depression and having a hard time trying to fall asleep in a hotel room.

I also play softball, I'm halfway decent but I'm not good and it gets to a point where there are really good players on the team and I still end up sitting the bench, I even paid to be on the team and they didn't, I ended up paying to play this year but kind of have my heart set on quitting, it's gotten to be toxic to me because I expect more out of myself than what happens, and just like the world everyone focuses on what you did wrong, not the many good things you have done.

This quarantine has not helped me mentally and the constant ghosting, friends making plans without me, and softball. Thank you for listening."
COVID-19 news and this pandemic is causing me severe dysfunction," 

'm pretty sure that the traits i had dealt with in 2016 that were PTSD-esque and major depressive during my 9 day mental breakdown are now the same as the ones in 2016. I am losing faith in everything, i have no hope, everything is drastically changed, i have been compromised mental health wise and really believe that this is one of the genuine triggers that could actually push me to commit suicide. I feel like mental health no longer matters to anybody, that i don't matter. i'm obsessively and compulsively obsessing about this social distancing and am even displaying what i suspect are a form of psychosis with really odd beliefs.

I feel like virus is in the air and is near me, and that if i get close to anyone we will all be infected, and the new changes to routine have been so hard. i am experiencing a full blown Anxiety and OCD episode that is characterized by severe derealization and feelings of unreality, mixed with very odd beliefs. I have also felt immense anger, i have felt like i wanted to inflict pain on many people and i have felt very aggressive, i have started mocking the governments and have even started calling for ''Anarchy''

it's easy to see that i am a high risk individual of suffering a breakdown at times like these. I am also experiencing severe side effects of my BPD, and feel this huge sense of abandonment from everyone and its getting to the point i can no longer function

i just wanna be in a coma for 10 months and so i can wake up and all this to be over, this is by far one of the toughest things i have dealt with. I blame the absolute shambolic government who is doing NOTHING TO Support suicidal people in times like these. My brain is in utter shock, i just took two diazepams to calm myself down and feel drowsy."
Ungluing myself from my bed,"I'm someone who spends around 16 hours a days on my bed. I sleep there, sometimes eat there, sometimes study there, most things I do are done on the bed. What's important is it needs to be seen as a place of sleep, and it limits what I do. I want to be asleep and awake at sensible times. I unhealthily use my phone in my bed for things I probably find boring, like a zombie, too the point where I still use it when I get tired.

I want to make sitting down attractive, or standing attractive, or walking attractive, or I want to make living on my bed feel unattractive. I do have ideas on how, but I'd like to hear other people's ideas and thoughts. In my room is my desk and chair, my bed, and my floor. I also have sofas in my shared kitchen, with a TV, and 3 flatmates, though I'm hesitant to interact with them. And, I obviously have the outside world.

The things I've tried is buying a cushion for my chair, and using one of those hand resistance things that's just a tool for fiddling that can't really be conveniently used in bed while on my phone. I was thinking of getting some PC games that I'd be able to run smoothly on my low-performing laptop, or investing in a Nintendo Switch, as I know that I'm spending most of my free-time doing things I don't find enjoyable and I like playing Smash Ultimate.

Thank you for your time."
I dont know what to do anymore.,"Here i am sitting in my dark room bingwatching how i met your mother, i texted 2 people and only got cold responses.

I feel like im the last piece of the puzzle that just happens to have a different picture.  I love my friends, but do they love me back? I dont know. 
I spend so much of my time making sure that everyone has what they need and no one does the same. 
My depression took over my life and people are starting to notice ajd drift from me. 
How long will i be the helpfull one? The one who always has time for others? The one who is always there for every one? How long will i feel this ways? For how long must i continue to live? I dont know, i just know that i am broken."
I lost my passion in music.,"I‚Äôm 23, still didn‚Äôt finished my music degree and I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to graduate from this course. I first studied AB English and told my dad that I can‚Äôt see my future with it. So, he allowed me to enroll a music degree. My major is Piano Concentration. I loved playing the piano since 7, though I wasn‚Äôt really good at it but I know how to play it. Since I got in a band in high school, that convinced my dad to take up Bachelor of Music. I started this course with [I think] 20% knowledge to Music Theory though I know how to read notes but not that fast. And I also started my First Proper Piano Lesson. I was doing great but my first piano teacher there keep on admiring advanced students instead of others like me and that made me miserable. I didn‚Äôt progress much.

By 3rd year, I had a new Piano Teacher and she was great. It made me go back to zero and that‚Äôs fine with me because I saw myself loving my passion again. I practice 6pm-9/10pm at school Mon-Sat. Until.... 1 night, a piano teacher came in my piano cubicle and told me that I am not allowed to practice there til 9/10pm because I AM NOT A ADVANCED STUDENT AND A RECITALIST. I told her that I need to practice in that kind of schedule because that‚Äôs the only time my body is productive to practice. So it‚Äôs like a body clock. On the other day, she reported me to the dean‚Äôs office and the dean told be that I shouldn‚Äôt be practicing on that schedule because it‚Äôs not in the rules. But I don‚Äôt remember that certain rule because I saw others practicing til 9pm so I thought it was okay. They still didn‚Äôt agree with me. After that discussion, I ran to the bathroom, cried so hard and called my dad about it. It was unfair. I was only doing it for myself because I want to be better. My dad bought me a 2nd hand electric piano so I can practice at my dorm. Everything went fine at first but I can‚Äôt get that incident out my head. It made me think that I‚Äôm a loser, talentless pianist there is in that school. That‚Äôs when I started to miss all my piano lessons and dropped my Piano Subject 3 times in a row.

It made me stayed in school since the 5th year. And I went to a psychiatrist to treat my traumas, my thoughts and insomnia. I was dianosed with depression with anxiety because of my thoughts of being afraid of what might happen next in the future. I‚Äôm terrified of tomorrows. That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt sleep.

I moved to another piano teacher because I was so embarrassed to come back to my previous one. She already gave up on me because I wasn‚Äôt making any progress. And it‚Äôs a total humilliation to her reputation. I‚Äôm on my 7th year now and my current Piano Teacher is also great and he really wants me to graduate next year. He was patient of letting me going back to zero and gave me piano recital pieces that I can play. But my problem now is that, IT‚ÄôS BACK. My demons are back and I haven‚Äôt returned to my psychiatrist since july. Because I‚Äôm afraid and my dad already used a lot of money for my mental health, sessions, medication and sleeping pills. I‚Äôm in a 3rd world country and we are not that rich.

I‚Äôm anxious that I might not graduate next year and it will make my parents misereble. I lost my passion in playing the piano that I can‚Äôt finish practicing 1 page in a day because of these thoughts and pain. 

I‚Äôm sorry for you to hear this. Because if I will not able to graduate next year. I will kill myself. I‚Äôm typing this 3 in the morning and crying. I haven‚Äôt told anyone that it‚Äôs back. Even my boyfriend. Everytime someone tries to cheer me up about my progress, I get depression. Imagine that. I getting depressed over positive things. I‚Äôm losing my mind, I feel so numb and I‚Äôm skipping piano classes again and I‚Äôm afraid of my piano teacher of seeing me not having any progress at all. I feel embarrassed, ashamed, angry at myself that I want to disappear right away. I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to graduate at all, to finish college, to become a good eldest daughter..."
Give me a reason to live.,"My situation with my family has been shitty for years now. Long story short...I came back for 10 days for the obligatory visit. And my mum just yelled at me because I was upset. Upset that she didn't express any happiness that i got shortlisted for an interview with my dream company. She says I'm weak for expecting expressions of joy when I should apparantly already know they're happy for me. She said some pretty shitty stuff and honestly I've lost all hope. I genuinely cannot take it anymore. 

I need reasons. Reasons not to end everything. God sometimes I just want to stab myself dead or overdose on antideps because nothing I do ever works. Never good enough. Too sensitive. Too weak. Too this too that. I've had it.

Please help...

UPDATE: I took a nap after typing this out and woke up to some of the kindest words I've ever heard from a bunch of strangers. I wish I could personally thank every single one of you. It helped me feel less alone you know? I cried while replying to you guys it was just so necessary for me to reach out here today or I don't know what I would've done. I was at wits end before I posted this and it isnt the first time I've seriously considered and visualized suicide.

I love you guys. I don't even know you all but I hope you feel it..wherever you are."

I am tired of being ""strong""; I am tired of appearing ""happy"" all the time (I do it for them, not because I am in the good mood all the time).  My family does not know it either, but I have to go on with my life for they need me. 

I am tired of loving everybody without receiving a portion of that love. I learned to love my loneliness, but now it feels like I need someone, but finding a partner who wants something serious is extremely hard (and I am not a Greek god, to be honest). I do not like dependency, however, I'd love to have someone to talk to besides my friends. I lost my best friend last year since I fell in love with her (don't do it, worst idea ever). Does anybody feel this way?  Does anyone go through the same thing?"
I finally found motivation.,"After 12 years of Type 1 Diabetes, 3 hospitalizations, 4 years of self harming, depression, insomnia and 2 near death experiences, I am ready to take care of myself again."
I'm losing my sanity day by day . I never been in this place before. What do I do and where do I began to clear my head.,"Here goes nothing , I found this app this morning and decided  why not. So here I am ... To begin I would say that the feelings that I have really buried deep away are starting to resurface. Outside of my thoughts during the day, cooking, cleaning, being a COOL MOM (smile) seriously I'm cool , collected and pretty much put together. I pretend ( can I say that) that I'm ok- cliche but I'm fucked up.My head goes bonkers with all type of cruel, belittling things and boy can we really get into ourselves. Everyday my children are growing, learning and watching my every single move, how can I let them see despair, hurt, anguish and such disgust within myself. Ever had to hide these kinda emotions from family and friends bc the chain of command begins with you so to say. Over the years yes years I have let myself rebuild, construct and motivate ppl watching them flourish happily I want the ones at my table to eat (understand) while my OWN life has taken a complete sad standstill. There's no fault here to noone nor am I searching for pity. My chest was heavy and I couldn't get to my pillow (üôÉ) This pandemic has taken it's very own toll on people outside of death in many different ways (sorry if any families has lost a loved one or may have suffered due to the virus hang in there!)  
Unfortunately I lost my job in Jan.2019 after 5 marvelous years due to my dad passing my Freaking Father üíî(very inconsiderate and inhumane) but I had no control over that. This is when I leaned HEAVY on my faith. I pray hard everyday and continue to without a doubt keep good faith never accepting a handout and remaining humble.I cried when the tears formed and screamed into pillows when the kids slept.... I'm beginning to lose a little of me everyday feels like. I can't!!! I have family, friends and by GOD I swear the best support hands down. Simply I don't want to make my burden a load on others. I pray for steady employment again just can't understand why is it so damn hard!! Like Oh man.. 
It hurts to want more and can't grasp it especially when you put super effort, remain positive, seek advice,look for guidance and keep my prayers consistent with my behavior.
 I must figure this out sooner than later. Just don't know how. Don't know how this app came about seriously but I'm almost sure it was just what I needed.Thanks for being here. Thanks for reading!üíõü¶ã‚ú®"
"In the ‚Äúhome stretch‚Äù for my classes, but finishing everything feels hopeless‚Äîany advice?","My classes went online about a month ago. I knew right off the bat this wasn‚Äôt going to be a good switch for me, motivation and focus-wise. In the beginning, I actually adjusted pretty well. However, now that it‚Äôs down to the wire (two weeks left of class), I feel overwhelmed and hopeless.

The only big assignments I have left are three essays, two final exams, and a final project. I also have a few regular assignments to finish before all these are due. I‚Äôm attempting to work on one of the essays that‚Äôs due this Friday, but it feels hopeless. I feel like it‚Äôs going to be an awful essay, that I might as well not turn it in, and that it‚Äôs impossible for me to finish all these assignments over the next 2-3 weeks. 

My university is providing the option to take an ‚ÄòS‚Äô grade for classes, so if I get above a D-, the class doesn‚Äôt affect my GPA at all. Part of me wants to take an ‚ÄòS‚Äô for all my classes and simply give up on the rest of the assignments. However, I know the guilt will eat me alive if I do this. Plus, I can‚Äôt guarantee I‚Äôll get above a D- in every class if I decide to take this route.

Is anyone experiencing something similar, or has in the past? Do you have any advice for dealing with this debilitating lack of motivation? I know I‚Äôm so close to the end of the semester, but it still feels impossible."
Depression has gotten pretty bad.,"Hi, so in these last months my world has been flipped upside down with the COVID19 messing with everything. Due to this I have had to move home into my verbally abusive household and finish my college program online. On top of this I am working a cashier job I hate, and I am left alone with my thoughts everyday I come home from work. My friends haven't contacted me in a few months and I'm always the one reaching out to them, and my partner is very distant.
I haven't felt this alone in a while. 
All in all everything keeps going wrong, one thing after the other. And I am tired of it. My suicidal thoughts have become evermore present this past month, and I'm requesting support because I just don't know how to feel okay anymore. 
I don't expect to be happy all the time, but I can't even remember the last time I felt happy. 
I just don't know what to do anymore. Thank you for reading."
My breakup is killing me,"Sorry about the melodramatic title, but this really is what it feels like. I'll try to keep this story short, however I could keep on talking for hours and if someone one this sub was willing to have a talk with me by PMs I'd love to because I'm just so incredibly lonely right now.

About a week ago my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me. It was a stupid breakup and I feel like my behaviour is the reason for why we broke up, even though she too made plenty of mistakes. When I lost her I once again realized how much she meant to me and that I didn't want to lose her at any costs so I tried to get her back. But all I got were mean-spirited messages saying how she doesn't miss me, she's realized we're incompatible and that she's glad I moved out.

Some days ago I created a tinder profile because I thought it'd help me get over her. Guess what, first evening on tinder I saw her profile. And it fucking killed me inside. The next days, she would routinely put some nice clothes on and leave, while I was stuck in the living room watching her leave to some tinder date, and it killed me. That's when I realized I had to leave.. so while she was at work I packed up all my stuff and left, leaving her one last voice message that I can't take the situation and that I still want her back. That's when I got her mean-spirited message.

I feel like she was all I had. People I talk to are telling me to distract myself with things that are fun to me, but frankly, I don't know what's fun to me anymore. Watching tv shows? Gaming? Playing the guitar? I feel like watching shows and gaming are just occupational therapy to me. I used to love playing the guitar, at least I think so, but nowadays I feel so fucking bad whenever I play that it's hard to call it fun either. Sports? I've gained some weight so I decided I wanted to lose \~10kg. That was a week ago, the same day she broke up with me (in fact, it's kind of the reason why we got into the fight responsible for our breakup). After that, I trained every day, thinking it'd help me lose weight. But in fact, while I lost \~1.5kg within a week, almost half of that was apparently muscle mass. I found out about that yesterday. Now I don't even want to train anymore.

In the last few weeks, I found myself repeatedly contemplating ""passive"" suicide, as in, it wouldn't be so bad if I drove recklessly and that killed me some day, wouldn't it? Now, I feel like I actually want to die. She had issues, and sometimes those issues really annoyed the hell out of me. But who doesn't have those? I feel stupid for losing her and I feel like I won't ever be able to forgive myself. I was ready to marry this girl, but I lost her, due to my own stupidity. I won't ever find another woman like her again, I know that for certain, and I hate myself for it. I would do anything to get back with her, but she has made it clear that she's not interested in me anymore.

Now I know that she will go on tons of tinder dates, kiss other guys, have sex with other guys, maybe in our shared bed and it's killing me inside. Is it jealousy? Purely hormonal? I hope it is because if this feeling goes on, I think I'm actually going to try something. I'm not in therapy, I know I should be, but my depression is making it hard to actually get a therapist. Not to mention that usually you'll have to wait a few months until there's a vacant spot. Please help me"
What are things an SO can do to help alleviate your depression?,"I am cross posting from r/depression since I am not sure which sub is more appropriate for this 


I have been dating my partner for like four months now. Even though we‚Äôve only been together for a little while I am completely crazy about him. He suffers from MDD and it is so upsetting for me to see such a smart, caring, funny & lovely person being suffocated by chronic feelings of hopelessness. He often jokes about how much he would like to be dead and it‚Äôs very hard for me to hear. I wish I could give him some of my own brains happy-chemicals. Seeing him like this makes me want to cry even though I want to be strong for him. I feel scared and anxious that he can‚Äôt enjoy our relationship or life as much as I do. I know that I can‚Äôt cure his depression but I wanted to ask for advice from other people with depression. What are things that your partner or friends have done that have helped to alleviate your pain or numbness?"
So depressed it takes effort to breathe today. I hate days like this.,"I have plenty to be depressed about, but I have plenty to be grateful for as well.  Sometimes the darkness wins.  I can't see the color in flowers, can't taste the sweetness in my coffee.  All I can do is go over and over in my head about how much I hurt, how few people out there understand this pain, how much I'm dreading the next five minutes, ten minutes, 12 hours... I could be dead in a matter of seconds and this would all end, but I never go that route.  But I could, maybe one day.  But not today."
Today is my birthday.,"And I feel even more lonely.

Why is birthday such a big deal to people?

I hope tomorrow comes quicker"
Addicted to sadness,"""Emotional pain can become an addiction.  A negative feeling, such as anger, worry, grief, fear, or depression, can become so habitual that you cannot live without it.  There are physical as well as mental reasons for emotional pain addiction.

When a person is continuously stressed by emotional pain, there are subtle changes in the body that create a dependency on stress-related chemistry. Changing habitual patterns of pain can be as difficult as giving up an addictive substance, such as nicotine, alcohol, or even heroin.  The emotional pain addict unconsciously seeks out situations that are sure to result in pain.  A history of prolonged, negative, stressful relationships is usually symptomatic of emotional pain addiction.  The feelings of love and pain are so frequently associated that they become one and the same.  Loving unavailable people and staying in intolerable relationships, for example, are signs that love and pain have become intertwined.  There are many such pain-linked feelings in the repertoire of pain addiction.  Understanding the physiological part of emotional pain addiction can make breaking these patterns easier.""

""Every emotion, either positive or negative, is a blend of chemicals (neurotransmitters and hormones) that our brain instantly produces in response to thoughts. This cocktail circulates throughout the body producing corresponding sensations that are felt at both the psychological and physical levels. The chemistry of emotion is very addictive, if repeated frequently over a long period of time -- just like the chemistry of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. This is most noticeable in the case of negative emotions, as they produce stress hormones that our body, in a twisted, self-destructive way, can easily start craving like a drug.""

""The presence of negative, distorted thoughts and feelings about reality leads to sadness and hopelessness. Sad people see themselves as worthless and get carried away by these emotions, leading them to abandon their usual activities. So not only do they perceive themselves as worthless, but they also abandon the activities that could counter this value judgment, which validates their beliefs.

This is where the vicious cycle begins, as they swap their routines and fun activities for a negative mood, without realizing that these activities could help them improve their situation and prevent their bad mood from intensifying. This creates a dynamic in which inactivity breeds more inactivity.""

""When you live with depression for years, you can become dependent on the familiarity of the mood. The negative patterns of thought associated with depression can become like an unhealthy coping mechanism, much like drugs and alcohol are for addicts. The negative thoughts and moods associated with bouts of depression may start to feel like a false sense of security.

Whether this constitutes an addiction is debatable, but what is obvious is that it is unhealthy and dangerous to get comfortable or dependent on a depressive mood. It can mean that a person gets stuck in the negative thought patterns and finds it more and more difficult to change.""

""So while my attachment to melancholy may not be ‚Äúbad,‚Äù it would be beneficial for me to push on those moments to discover what I might be avoiding, what to bring to therapy rather than what to soothe away with a Solange album. Barth suggested that ‚Äúone of the ways one might gradually get to those feelings is to really try to put into words what the melancholy feels like ‚Äî physically as well as emotionally (like even where it‚Äôs located in your body and what color it is!).‚Äù

Perhaps the healthy way to approach melancholy is with moderation, to give room to those other stronger feelings even when it means making room for pain.""

I want to be happy again.,"  

Goal: Currently I am all timer sad and want to be happy.¬†

I am neither a good person nor a bad person. I am somewhere in the middle or maybe totally out of circle. I don't know.¬†

I feel like I am living three lives. One which I show to my Family, one to friends and ex-colleagues. I am jobless. And one my true self which I show to myself only. Of course any differences in personality from my true self I manage by pretending someone else in my other two lives. But as soon as I enter my room and after carefully slowly locking my door I throw away the mask I was wearing and then I can clearly see the differences in my voice, thoughts, body language and goals, if any. My body feels so relieved. Then I start getting back in my true zone where I forget the tasks and goals I had planned in my mind. And I start feeding myself the worthless shit on Internet. At that time, I am only looking for that temporary dopamine hits because nothing simpler was giving me any joy. I started losing myself in weed. I sometimes was stealing weed from my friends or roommates. After smoking for at least 3 years, a small joint was not that powerful anymore to bring down the curtains covering my real life problems. So, I jumped to eating. Now again, simpler food was not any joy. Junk is pretty much gonna hit the D-spot. Small meals mean less dopamine. Give me more and more. Don't worry, I'll puke the previous and eat again until I am so wasted by the effort of eating - throwing - eating- throwing and of course the taste of food. There are consequences too. Bloating, Gas, Always upset. But nothing can stop me from doing it again and again atleast from last 2 years nothing has stopped me. Then in search for more dopamine I look for porn. Again, simple means no joy. Fell into Hetero-BBC - Trans - Sissy. Now I don't imagine me having sex with girl instead I am that girl and big funk is fucking me. I started dreaming about dicks. Bought a vibrating dildo. But deep inside I still have that longing for intimate relationships with girl. I never had any.¬†

I am king of overthinking. I think of every consequence of my actions. Like where I keep dishes in kitchen. Opening and closing door. Even when I am walking down the road. Striking a lighter to light my joint. everything small you can imagine. This makes me mad and too conscious. I keep thinking of my childhood scenes where I lived with my parents and always wondering how time has passed. I was a kid back then and now I am an adult. I am so obsessed with age of people. How old is he or she? That actor? That sports person? and then I compare what I was doing when I was 16, 18, 23 etc. I am 26 right now.¬†  
 I don't check my actions usually but when I check them, they are bad. I am using same pair of clothes for months. Using same toothbrush for years. I have rarely gave any gifts to any one. I am not so close with my parents. I am single child. I lived in rented place for 11 years before leaving for another city for college. My parents finally have their own house now. We live with parents in India till death.¬†  
 I used to steal erasers, scales etc. from school. Even from my parents too. I have been caught sometimes. I now realized that maybe I was less satisfied with myself. I always felt less because all my relatives and friends had there own houses and car. My parents had one two-wheeler and my parents used to fight with each other which used to make me very sad. When I used to watch other parents living happily, I used to think why I don't have that, why my parents are always fighting? This less feeling I still have with me. I still feel less.¬†  
 I am lazy for sure. Now I am sitting idle from last 1 year. No job, no friends, no personal connection with any human being. I never tell my secrets to anyone. Living in a rented room. Financially fucked, Relationships fucked.¬†  
 I feel like a failure. I failed to become a good son, friend, brother, grandson or colleague.¬†  
 I have become more secretive from last 2 years. I eat secretly, want to live secretly (deleting my pictures from social media).¬†  
 I sometimes think If my parents die then I would have no one to answer and then I can live this miserable life for long. I don't think about my future at all. I have not reached the suicide point yet but I think this is how you reach there eventually. I can't imagine myself having a simple life with family and kids and work. I get very anxious imagining that will I be able to do that for these many years. I blame myself for all this. I did not take action when it was needed.¬†  


In the end, I just want to be happy.¬†"
Depressed firefighter ends things,"My (30 f) ex boyfriend (34) ended things from depression at the beginning of the shut down from covid. He told me he didnt love me anymore almost 3 weeks ago.  I dont know if this is how he really feels or if it's the depression closing him off to feeling anything. I haven't spoken to him since he told me. But I go back and read older messages leading up to the break up and I see him telling me he's struggling with the depression but he tells me how happy I make him and how much he loves me and I keep him afloat. But once he hit a really bad rough patch he closed me out completely. Has anyone experienced this before from my position or even from his that could give me some insight of how their stories progressed with their loved ones as the depression lasted/or while you or they got help? I believe in my heart he does love me and the depression suppressed those feelings. You dont just have those feelings disappear from a happy relationship without some type of issue going on. I've been dying to reach out to him but I was the one that said I needed to heal, but with the riots going on and him being a firefighter and his mother telling me he said the therapist is getting him to open up I want to reach out so bad. Can yall share your stories and give me any insight on his possible feelings or what people did in my own personal shoes? :/ He is the love of my life and losing him has been the hardest thing I've ever experienced.  He also has never dealt with depression before so it's entirely new for him. Thank you for anyone and everyone that can help or atleast share their own experiences."
I‚Äôm so scared.,"I don‚Äôt know what to do. It feels like I might have a panic attack right now, I‚Äôm just trying to stay calm. I don‚Äôt really know what to write, or what to say. I just need to do something to distract myself. My parents think I‚Äôm doing great with staying home and stuff, but to be honest I‚Äôm really stressed. I haven‚Äôt done much schoolwork because it makes me even more stressed. I‚Äôve been sewing a lot because I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I think of all the people scared right now, and it makes me more scared myself. I don‚Äôt want to talk to anybody, because I don‚Äôt know what to say. I feel like I want to cry, but I just can‚Äôt. Physically, no tears will come out. I‚Äôm sorry, I just needed to write something. Thank you if you read this. I‚Äôm just in a not very good place right now, health wise. It‚Äôs just really hard"
Feeling down cause I realized I don't know what to do with my life in the long-term,"So I was talking with a friend and the topic of what we're interested in and what we want to do in the future was brought up, and I realized that I really don't know what to do with my life. I've been going to the gym, taking watercolor classes, and before the COVID-19 situation, was trying my best at school, but for what? In the end I don't know what I actually want to do with my life, my mind is just an incoherent mess. I feel jealous of him, he's two years younger than me and knows so much about lots of topics, while I just barely grasp the surface of a lot of them; I'm almost 18 and I still feel like a kid who can't even keep herself standing for too long. I've done so much to try to feel happy, fullfil my life, to learn more, but in the end I feel like a fool, a pathetic fool. Sometimes I  don't even feel like not even trying anymore, because it leads me nowhere, I can't progress as much as I fucking want. I'm just feeling really down rn, I was planning to do so much today, but now I don't wanna even move, I feel so useless."
I feel like shit and I just need to talk to someone.,Dm if you want
My life is in shambles and I just want to feel happy again...,"So about two years ago, my parents forced me to move cross country to accommodate for my dads new job. Now, I‚Äôm 25, am a year away from losing my parents health care, jobless, and am isolated to the point where the depression I have is only getting worse by the day.

Now, the things that used to keep me temporarily happy aren‚Äôt filling that void anymore. Help."
"On paper, life is better. Inside, I haven‚Äôt improved.","(I originally posted this in r/depression, but I‚Äôm under the impression that it‚Äôs full of folks who would rather seek gratification that they are not alone rather than support. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but I am looking for feedback and a little advice, if possible. I hope to see you in a place where there is no darkness.)

I really hate posting this. It‚Äôs narcissistic, but I must satisfy the gnawing hunger of loneliness. It‚Äôs shameful, but a small morsel would be a blessing. Please forgive me.

In summary, while I‚Äôm aware it could have been much worse, I‚Äôve had a terrible childhood. I‚Äôve had social anxiety, terrible social skills, and half of a family. I was the bullied and ostracized for the first half. My concept of a friend at the time were the same people who would lie, cheat, and steal from me. Hopes that things would be different in middle/high school/college became disappointment as the cycle repeated itself. There were brief moments where I got a taste of what real friends were like, genuine people without judgements. However, they were very brief, and I never really made any lasting relationships.

I got away from it all. I emigrated to a country far away. The first year was tough, and I thought history would repeat itself once again. However, things got better, and  I live a somewhat comfortable life (at least, relative to my past).

I should be happy and fine. Yet I still feel hollow and empty. Despite knowing some genuine friends, I still find it difficult to put my trust in others and open up. No one wants to be forced to listen to my sob story; they have their own problems to handle. Very often, my past memories come back to haunt and torment me. On the outside, I would describe myself as a tad quiet and lazy, but positive and helpful. Inside, lethargic would be the best word to describe it.

I am grateful for where I am now, and each moment is a blessing. At the same time, life is in auto-pilot, and nothing would be better than laying on the floor in a remote cabin in Alaska, away from everyone.

You are entitled to your opinion, and I‚Äôm not going to judge you, so I ask you not to judge me. I just want to know if there is anyone else out there who is in this kind of situation.

TL;DR: Move along

Edit: I greatly appreciate the feedback I‚Äôve gotten here. It really is true that even a match can bring warmth on a cold day. I‚Äôll be taking some time to respond to some of the comments, and I hope that I can repay the favor in kind someday."
"No job, no money, no friends, no family, no pets, no future.","Hi guys, this is my first post. I think my post title sums up my life. I‚Äôm really struggling to see the point in life. I have always worked hard and have been self employed for nearly 20 years. In the last year or so work has dried up and I‚Äôm not much good at anything else. To compound all this I‚Äôm not a very bright guy and really can‚Äôt see the point in carrying on with things and can‚Äôt see a way forward in life.

I‚Äôm not sure what to do as my depression has also recently wrecked my marriage but fortunately I don‚Äôt have any kids. I just need some advice really. üò≠ I feel very alone. I also have no pets as i‚Äôm Not allowed them where I live. I literally have nothing."

Do I have the right to be depressed,"many friends and family tell me I shouldn't be depressed because i have much more than others. Yes, I am able to eat what i want daily and have lots of people who care and love me. But i just can't help it. 

So do you think i am just...like weak ? or do i have the right to be depressed ?  


(sorry if i couldn't  convey my message exactly how i want it, i am not  a native speaker) "
Do you ever just feel angry?,"I woke up today feeling angry. Angry at nothing and everything. I know I need to meditate and chill out and prepare myself for a busy day...but I just want to sit here on reddit and figure out my brain. I want to listen to music and to the birds.

So lets all try to give ourselves a break when we start to feel upset, aggrivated and like you need to go run away/hide/jump out a window.

Breathe and remember that you are a STRONG, BEAUTIFUL human being that can be happy.

I have been trying to forgive myself as well as others today.

I wish you all a peaceful day!

"Please help, I feel so hopeless","Woke up this morning feeling like absolute shit. It feels as if I have something in my stomach thats heavy. I am suffering from OCD and intrusive tohughts. I recently decided to stop drinking alcohol, because it makes everything worse. I know Im also going to lose some friends because of this, and It just feels so bad! I went to a doctor yesterday and she upped my prozac to 30 mg a day, and im supposed to see a new therapist this week. Im so stressed out by my studies and just life in general."
Not sure if I was meant to do better in life,"I've been working in restaurants for over 8 years and I'm sick of it. I want to leave this hellish job and find something better. I've always wanted to work in an office/corporate job. I feel like it's a whole lot more respectable than waiting tables/bartending.

I've applied to 90 places over the past 5 months and they've all rejected me. The jobs I've applied for were for business admin, data entry, sales, customer service, and general office clerk. I feel like I'm just too dumb/useless to work a ""real grown up job"". All my coworkers at my current job are under the age of 25. I feel so weird/bored working with a bunch of kids. 

I thought about going back to school, but idk....I really got to think about this. I already dropped out of school like 3 times now. I've failed a lot of classes and switched majors like 3 times. I don't want to o back to school and end up wasting more time and money like I did all those years ago."
I (18M) think my girlfriend (18F) is falling into a depression and I don't know what to do about it.,"Ok first of all I think this needs some context. We both live in a country where males are given far more rights and freedoms than females, and her dad is a tyrannical controlling misogynist and he doesn't let her do anything (basically she's been in quarantine her entire life). This is the main source of her sadness and it's really affecting her mental state negatively. She rants to me about it a lot and I try my best to make her feel better but I'm running out of ideas. 

About a month ago we were planning a way to get out of here and build a new life in a foreign country but, unfortunately, the plan flopped. Even without the coronavirus, there's no way to get her out of here safely without her father's permission. So the only way to get out is for us to get married, because when that happens I'll be the one legally in control of her (yeah, it's fucked up, I know). 

My family said I can't get married until I get a bachelor's degree (got 4 years left). This happened about a week ago and that really fucked my girlfriend's mental state up. She was sad before but at least she had hope for the future, now she says she feels like there's no hope for her and that she's losing her youth. 

At first I thought she was just exaggerating, because she was frustrated that our plan flopped, and I told her it was gonna be alright and motivated her successfully (or so I thought) but it's been a whole week and she's still depressed. I don't know what to do since we can't really be together because of this lockdown and her piece of shit dad. I send her motivating texts and constantly remind her that she's a wonderful amazing person and that she makes me really happy, but that doesn't seem to have any long term effects. 

We were talking today before she went to sleep and she said she was feeling down again, but this time she didn't have a specific reason to feel this way. that's why I'm worried and I think this is a much deeper issue than I previously thought. I asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she said ""thanks but I don't think it'll help"". I just sent back some sweet messages that got a positive reaction then we said goodnight. 

I hope that this is normal sadness and I'm just overthinking, but what can I do to make her feel better or to maybe stop the sadness altogether? Thanks."
My doctor forgot to call in my meds,"They‚Äôre closed for the weekend and I‚Äôm in really bad shape 3 days off meds. Is there an emergency-type of meds I can take to make the zaps lessen? I‚Äôm on Pristique so being off it so suddenly is also causing havoc on my gastrointestinal system as well.

Edit: thank you all for the advice. I called my doctor and she said, as some of you suggested, to call the pharmacy and ask for an emergency supply. I asked her what to do if they refused and she said call us in the morning. Which I was planning on doing originally anyway. By the time I called the pharmacy, however, it was already closed. I can‚Äôt drive myself to urgent care as some of you have also suggested because the shakes are pretty bad. Whatever could go wrong has gone wrong. I just have to ride it out. And I‚Äôm changing doctors tomorrow.

Edit 2: Just wanted to say thank you to all of you again. I called my doctor 3 times - once yesterday, twice this morning and then the pharmacy and still nothing has been done. So I begged the pharmacy and they‚Äôre giving me a 3 day emergency supply which I am getting a neighbor to pick up for me (bless her). The zaps are really bad and work is always crazy on Mondays and I feel like I‚Äôm about to lose my job because I can‚Äôt focus to save my life. Anyway my point was I never would have known about any of these options (asking for emergency supplies) if it hadn‚Äôt been for you all and I just wanted to say THANK YOU and to all of you who reached out to me. Sorry I‚Äôm totally rambling!!!!"
I feel like I'm spiralling again.,"Things should be good now but I can't seem to stop thinking about how I always manage to ruin my relationships and people let go of me once they realize I'm a mess who requires far more support than anyone could reasonably give. I spend as much time at work as I can just to be around my coworkers, who are pretty much my only friends at this point. I don't even know what I want anymore, I'm just upset. I try not to expect too much from people but then I feel hollow and disconnected. 

I've tried therapy. It was alright until I got scared and felt I was wasting everyone's time with my complaining. I'm sorry. Things are going well in my life, really. But I'm still such a mess inside and that's so scary. 

I really want to be loved but I don't know how. I really want to love myself, but I don't know how."
Life just feels over and I'm only in my mid 20's.,"I just don't know how to get the will to keep going. I've been through hell, and I have no blood family left. 

I know some people never know their real family, and I know life would've been so much worse without them, but damn, the ""tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all"" saying just doesn't feel right anymore. 

I wish that if my biological dad, mom, step dad, and brother would all be dead by the time I turned 25, that I had never gotten to know and love them and rely on them. 

Every paternal figure in my life has died. After my step dad killed himself, his best friend took over as my ""Uncle"". Within 3 years, he had a massive heart attack and passed away. After several similar occurences I've gotten superstitious about father figures. 

I have a full-time job, a fiancee, and pets. I want to be happy and hopeful so badly for them, but I just get so stuck and depressed. I feel like they should be enough for me, and I'm a burden by being depressed. 

I've lost so many friends over the years (it happens to high school and college I know) that it doesn't feel normal, and feels like my depression is driving them away. 

If I hadn't inherited a nightmare I might be ok, but my mom left me several cars (and an RV) that are all in disrepair and not smogged or registered. I look at them every day and cry, but I feel powerless to get out of here. 

I think there might be equity in the house, but I'm terrified of all the issues a home inspector might find when we go to sell. 

I'm falling apart and I just don't know what to do. I want to seek therapy, but I'm already paying a mortgage that's $1,000 more than I can afford every month. I'm drowning in debt. I need to get rid of those cars, but every time I try, something happens and I can't get it done, then I get discouraged and don't try anymore. It makes sense that if I'm wasting a ton of money just on my depression and not getting things in order that therapy is a worthwhile investment, but I haven't had good experiences with therapy in the past. I also know that if they look at my income it looks like I'm making plenty of money, so I don't think sliding scale would help. 

I don't want to die, but living takes way too much effort. That scares me, because I've heard that described as ""Passive suicidal ideology"" or something. I'm just so tired. I have no desire to do anything because I know spending money will make me have to work on selling the house even sooner. 

I don't know if I can ask the mortgage company to lower my payment while I work on selling, or what since the loan is in a trust. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for here, I've written this all in a journal a million times. I just needed to share this with someone, and this community seemed appropriate? I'm sure I'll get plenty of ""Go to therapy"" comments.

 I feel so guilty sharing my feelings. Everyone just says ""Oh, it's so unfair what happened to you"" and I know. I wish I could stop feeling sorry for myself even though I really don't have it THAT bad in the grand scheme of things. 

I just want to feel actual happiness again, and be able to not bring everyone around me down. 

Again, I'm not going to hurt myself(I truly don't think so). I haven't felt truly suicidal since middle school/one episode when I was 19/20 after my longtime girlfriend cheated on me and left me. I only attempted once when I was young. 

I know that I'm capable of getting through this, I am just in constant emotional agony currently. I generally consider myself to be logical and of a moderate intelligence, but I feel so stupid and irrational. 

If you took the time to read this I appreciate you. 

Here's to feeling better. Thanks."
Help with Negative Self Talk,"I just started therapy and this came up. Even trying to talk about how poorly I view myself makes me cry. I get more embarrassed and want to run. I have anxiety as well and have to somehow return to therapy each week. Anyway, I am struggling to turn off this negative self talk. I know I need to replace it but am not doing that too well. I have a parent who directly impacted the way I view myself and have tried to distance myself from them since learning about my issues with the therapist. Aside from cutting off that source of judgement and negativity, what else can I do to work on this? What have you done to help shift your mindset. Are there any books you‚Äôd recommend? Or activities I can try?"
Music that I feel would help people dealing with hardships to listen to.,"Look up Boyce Avenue. The album is so perfect for the explanation of life events. From a bad breakup, feeling lonely, how not to be hard on yourself, etc. highly highly recommend. Hope it helps people looking for some answers but don‚Äôt have the person there then to tell you."
Currently victor over my depression. I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to be a support. Just message me.,"I found my hope in recovery groups and I do positive things on a daily basis which over time has made my life gradually less and less of a crisis. 

I know what it‚Äôs like in the place where nothing matters and I‚Äôm lucky to have made it out for now. 

I‚Äôm grateful for my blessings and I would be grateful to be there for you. Just send me a word"
Feeling Lost and Weak,"Hi there, um, I don‚Äôt really know how else to start this, so I‚Äôm just gonna go, okay? okay.

I‚Äôve struggled with severe anxiety and depression for basically my whole life. Or maybe not my whole life, it‚Äôs hard to remember, but definitely after my mother died. Car accident. Nasty business. I was 12, I saw it happen. I think I‚Äôve been broken ever since then.

It got worse and worse and worse over the course of a decade. I went from honors student, ‚Äú‚Äùgifted‚Äù‚Äù, to dropping out of college. My brain felt like it was clogged up with glue. But I told myself it was all my own fault, that I was just lazy, selfish, immature. Making excuses.

I‚Äôve seen some doctors, therapists too, most of them were incredibly unhelpful. The stress of dealing with the medical system outweighed any help I got from them. Any medications they tried to make me feel better were duds at best.

I went through a really, REALLY bad period about 3-4 years ago. I lost my entire group of friends, and let myself be abused by my partner for far longer than I should. I turned to self-harm, it was the lowest point I‚Äôd been in my life. I still see the scars when I look in the mirror.

But then I started to get better! I got new friends, got a job, allowed myself to be proud for once. I stopped self harming, swore never to again. Even after getting sexually harassed by my (thankfully ex) boss, even after losing my grandfather to cancer, I kept it together...for about a year and a half.

Almost exactly one year ago I got hit by a car as I was crossing the street. Physically I was mostly unharmed, but it brought back all those memories from the accident where I lost my mother. I started becoming irritable, lethargic, occasionally manic, and the panic attacks...at one point I was having full panic attacks ever single day.

I knew I needed help, but I felt powerless to get it. I had to leave my old clinic because the stopped taking my insurance. I wanted to switch to insurance through work but I‚Äôd already missed the cutoff date. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to apply for another year....

I almost made it. But I was unspooling too fast. I ended up leaving that job before I could get the help I needed. But that was fine, I had enough savings to get me through a month or two, I could find a new job.

That was, I don‚Äôt even know, three months ago? I haven‚Äôt even applied. I just...can‚Äôt find the energy. I know I need help, I know I‚Äôm really sick, but I just...can‚Äôt move. I‚Äôve had the website for a local therapist open in my tabs the whole time (one that I can email, because holy hell phonecalls are an anxiety nightmare even when I‚Äôm feeling sane) but everytime I go to reach out I just get paralyzed by anxiety and uncertainty, and I just can‚Äôt find the will to muster through it. I haven‚Äôt gone back to self-harming but I‚Äôm so afraid of ending up back in that place again, it‚Äôs been a struggle. I just don‚Äôt know what else to do. I just don‚Äôt know what I CAN do?! I‚Äôve been exhausted all day but I can‚Äôt even sleep. And I feel like I‚Äôm crying but my face is utterly still

Fuck I‚Äôm sorry this wasn‚Äôt supposed to be nearly this long. If you read all that, thanks, sincerely.

I imagine my suicide almost daily,"Hi Reddit. I don't know where to start. But the fact I am here now writing this is proof to myself that something is wrong with me. I'm not sure if I should begin with my childhood and work up to now or if I should just flat out say what's bothering me right now. But more or less, I think about killing myself; at least once, every day. When I wake up first thing in the morning I feel a gaint rush of anxiery and dread over the fact that once again, I did not die in my sleep and I have to somehow live today. Every night before bed sometimes I imagine my eventual suicide and I smile because I know that's probablly going to be one of the 'happiest' moments of my life. I get so nervous thinking about killing myself though even though the concept beings me peace, because I was raised unity christian growing up so I am worried I will go to hell if I do commit suicide. I also fear being stuck in 'purgatory' if I do commit suicide (which is almost just as bad as hell) if not considered actual 'hell' in some religions. I stay up at night fearing going to sleep sometimes as well because I have such vivid and intense dreams. I even dream about attempting suicide in my dreams and when I have those types of dreams I usually wake up and immediantly run to the bathroom to go vomit. What else can I say? I have Ptsd from surviving an armed robbery at my work and I have survivor's guilt because I feel bad for surviving it and not being able to just go back to my ordinary life now.  (Instead now I have ptsd and I fear even going outside to the groceey store. ) I feel guilty because the other girl that survived the robbery is fine and seems to be living her life and traveling and is unafraid (where as I have trouble even going outside period after what happened to me.) I feel like if I couldn't just bounce back and act 'normal' like her, that perhaps those guys should have killed me that night when they were pointing the gun at me to rob my place of work. So I have survivor's guilt but I also hate myself. I really hate who I am. I hate my looks. My voice. My choices in life. Everything basically. I am a 22 year old female and I have thinning ultra fine brown hair that's not very thick at all and I am so self concious about my hairline and lack of thick hair that I don't even want to go out in public or even be seen because I feel so disgusting and ugly that I have had random teenagers point at me in public and make gagging noises over my appearance. I know I am not always ugly because I have actually modeled in the past. The thing was I used hair extensions and make up to hide my discolored anorexic looking skin and acne, and to make my hair look as beautiful on the outside as I felt on the inside.  Then my hair started thinning out so bad that I couldnt wear hair extensions anymore and I am at the point where I should probablly wear a wig but the ones with realistic hairlines cost like $500 and I don't have that right now. My hair is also right now dyed this ugly ass copper penny color (auborn brown color faded) and my brown roots are large and they blend into the copper tones like an ombre but i know my hair is ugly. I went to cosmetology school but even I can't figure out how to fix my hair or make up. I thought I was alright at make up for a while and then I went back and really looked at my photos and that's when I started even hating my face with make up on.  I have gotten to the point where I hardly even wear make up because I know it doesn't look good on me. I just have an ugly face. My acne is bad and the make up doesn't hide it completely.  I feel like whenever I wear make up I just look even more ugly. Like the make up is enhancing all my insecurities. I have stretched ears too and I know people think that shit is gross so I am self concious about the fact that people probablly take one look at me and judge me to be homeless based on my outfits/lack of nice hair and make up and name brands. So on top of my ptsd and depression and anxiety, I am pretty sure I have some body dymorphia thoughts affecting me and how I see myself. I actually don't like to look in the mirror for too long because I actually get depressed seeing how ugly I am. I just imagine myself to look better than I actually do so when I see myself and my true ugliness, I get dissapointed and I hate myself for even trying to pretend to be pretty. That's another thing that I suffer from: Imposter syndrome. I suffer from feeling like a fraud or imposter most days. When I worked at different jobs like chipotle, and target, I still felt like any moment they were going to find out I wasn't really as great as they thought I was and they were going to fire me. I always fear people finding out that I have anxiety and then getting rid of me because of it. I try my best to hide it, but my ptsd is so bad that I have had to quit jobs due to my anxiety over being fired for attendence or something. I worry a lot. I compare myself to everyone else in the world and I think I am an imposter that is not as good as other people even at the things I love to the point where I don't even want to do the things I love anymore because I think I suck and that anyone can do it, probablly better than me. I used to have so many dreams and hobbies and now I just think I suck at everything to the point where I just don't want to exist because I don't think the world has any room for me. I feel like I don't deserve to live here on earth because I am such a loser. I feel like it is already too late for me and I will never amount to anything. I fear I will spend all of my life or the rest of my life in a mental hospital if I ever tell anyone these thoughts and feelings that I have so I try to keep it to myself but it's slowly eating me alive. I wish I could die. I don't want to be here anymore because I don't think I was ever meant to be here. I think some days that I was meant to kill myself. I feel like I am just another human taking up space and contributing to global warming. I just over all don't see any value to my life at all. I've let my depression and ptsd take over to the point where I don't sing anymore, write lyrics or draw or do anything I once dreamed of doing. I've deleted my social medias for the most part so I have nothing to do all day. I smoke weed and watch anime and that's how I have been spending my days but this isn't how I want to live my life and I know that but each dat that passes where I don't accomplish my dreams further puts me into a pit of dispair where I feel like committing suicide because it is too late for me to live my dreams. I worry I am too mentally ill now from what I have been through to ever actually accomplish my dreams and that concept alone makes me want to kill myself because I can already imagine myself being 80 years old and still watching anime and having no life and feeling the way I do now, and if that's what my future has in store for me, then I might as well just end my life right now. I don't have really any friends and I am too scared to go out and make them because I don't think anyone would ever want to be friends with me anyways because I am so nerdy and weird. I don't even know how to communicate anymore. When I go out to the store to get a sandwhich, I try to make small talk but I don't even want to do that. I don't like social interaction anymore even though I crave it sometimes from all the social isolation I have put myself through. When I say I don't know how so socualize anymore I really mean it. I go outside and idk wheather to make eye contact with people or weather to look down or if I should smile or not when I pass by people or if they think I am some homeless drug addict for doing that. I get so mentally stuck on what other people could be thinking of me that it makes it hard for me to talk to people in real time and keep up with their conversation or even know what to say to them and I worry that my face and eyes are giving away how scared I am to even be socializing and I worry it makes me vulnerable and an easy target. Okay, now, let me add that I grew up in an abusive home enviorment with a narcissistic dad and narcisstic mom. They were verbally,  physically, emotionally and sexually abusive to me growing up and even now they are still abusive so when I see them on holidays it is very hard on me because they say such hurtful things to me. I think that's why I care so much about what other people think, because my own parents told me I deserved to be sexually abused because of what I looked like. I had rainbow hair from age 17-21 and a septum ring and my own parents said that that made me look ""mentally ill"" and ""easy to take advantage of"" and a bunch of other hurtful things. To be honest the rainbow hair was the only choice I ever made for myself that I actually felt was mine and it made me happy. I also did it vwry beautifully because I went to cosmetology school so it was really beautiful. I'm sad my hair is too thin to allow me to dye it anymore but I used to feel good about myself when I looked that way even though my parents hated it. Looking back now, I still think I look ugly in a lot of different ways. Now, I must also add that I have an eating disorder. I currently weigh 132 or so but I'm a size small in everything. I used to throw up every day multiple times a day and I weighed 94 lbs. That's when I got a medical marijuana card and that helped me eat food again and stuff. My eating disorder is anxiety related so it doesn't have anything to do with body image. I just feel so stressed all the time that it's hard for me to eat anything because I am afraid it will make me feel sick and I will throw up so I am pretty thin because I hardly eat and I am very self concious about my eating disorder problems and the health problems that come with it. I am now also self concious about my teeth because from all the vommitting my gums have been receding and I am afraid to even show my mouth smiling because I am so self concious that my mouth looks like a drug addicts mouth or something. I do smoke weed but I didn't think weed could cause gum problems or teeth problems. I'm afraid to go to a dentist and find out how bad my mouth is. I know I need to go, but it's just one more thing to add to my endless list of things that are now stressing me out. I am sorry to ramble on and to make this post so long but since I haven't been established with a therapist yet, I have no where else to vent this and no one to say this to. I have to let it out somehow; so here were are. Anyways, after saying all this and seeing that this is my life, I feel like killing myself because I hate what a pathetic loser I am. I hate that I am not making music like I want to and instead I allow my mind to put me down so much that I consider committing suicide almost daily. I wish I could ""just get better"" so I can live my life again and make music and have my dreams happen. But I worry a lot that maybe my dreams were never meant to happen because I was born disadvantaged mentally (with anxiety and depression and phobias) I'm worried that because my mom and dad made me, I have their problems genetically passed to me and because of that, I am worried that some of my anxiety was passed down to me so any idea that I had growing up of me ever being a singer or an artist one day was foolish because I was born with the predisposition for anxiety so I was never meant to fulfil my dreams and me even dreaming them was stupid to begin with because people who are mentally ill like me can never accomplish anything/or it's extremely hard for them to accomplish things because their own mind is their number one enemy. That's basically what I worry/think/feel all the time and that actualization alone makes me want to kill myself the most because I feel abolsutely foolish and worthless. Worthless from birth and foolish for ever thinking I could ever be otherwise. This feeling...all these feelings are hell on earth for me and I can't take it anymore. I have created a hell on earth for myself within my own mind and it is horrible. My own thoughts on myself are so self sabotoghing that I can't do anything anymore. I've lost interest in everything. All my dreams. All my goals. Even hope of me feeling happy on my next birthday is dwindling. I don't even feel happy when I eat food, I feel depressed. I don't want to go inside a mental hospital because I know it will make me feel more sad and I won't eat the food there. I'll only eat the strawberries if they give them to me because I just don't like food. I know all this is affecting my health. I just don't know what to do about it. I already saw my doctor recently and she gave me a refferal for therapy and I am currently on a waiting list but my anxiety is so bad I haven't even called back to see if they can get me into an appointment. This is my life. It's shit. And I know I shouldn't be complaining because some people out there have it way worse than me so I feel like I don't deserve to have this platform to even tell people how I feel. I feel like I should just suck it up and move on but I can't.  I really want to just end my life already and stop taking up other people's time. If I've gone 22 years feeling this terrible I don't think I can survive anymore. I want to end my life but I am scared of going to hell if I do so. I'm not worried about hurting people by ending my own life. You can't convince me anyone (including my own family) would even miss me or really feel much pain past the initial shock of hearing my death but secretly everyone in my  family would be happy to see me dead because I don't think they like me anyways. I haven't talked to any of them in months,  some of them years, and I haven't seen friends either. I've been trying to make myself dissapear and fade into the background of people's lives for a while now. I used to be an instagram model until one day I realized everything about my life was shallow, empty, and meaningless and that's when I decided to just delete my instagram and fb...and myself. I don't think anyone hardly noticed my disappearing on social media because I had only 2 messages from people asking about it and those people don't talk to me very regularly anyways. I didn't have many followers on my instagram so I don't think anyone missed me much. I made this reddit over a year ago to post a story about how I almost was abducted into sex trafficking but it was too hard on me with my ptsd to re live what happened by telling the story again so I haven't finished my first post ever on the subject due to that. Anyways, I don't expect anyone to read this post or even see it. I don't think anyone will respond either because I don't think my life is that valuable compared to other people. I bet there are people out there that will see this post as proof there is a mental health crisis in america and that I should just end my life already if I am already in this much pain. I guess what stops me from killing myself is the fear of 1. Going to hell and 2. Possibly regretting it because I could have changed my life and got better somehow and braved the storm. :/ those ideas hold me back but it doesn't stop me from wanting to end my life when I am faced with any minor setback. I hate that aspect about me. I wish I wasn't like that. Anyways, I am sorry for making this so long. I wish this wasn't my life and that I did not feel this way but unfortunately, this is how I feel and I have to let it out somehow. I hope life can get better me. I hope I don't have to kill myself. I hope I can feel 'happy' again for a long time and have it be genuinley real. I hope I can get past this stuff and make my dreams come true but as each year passes I lose more and more hope that things could ever be better each time. I do not know how much longer I can take of doing nothing with my life. I'm sorry this post couldn't be happier. I'm sorry I exist. I'm sorry I exist at all. I'm sorry for complaining online and for doing nothing in real life to feel better other than crying. I'm sorry I am so weak and pathetic. I wish I could be stronger. I wish I didn't feel this way. I'm sorry."
Expectations and depressive episodes,"**This perspective has helped me with severe, sudden episodes: **

Ok. So your brain has decided to take a massive shit on you. 

Fucking fantastic!

Don‚Äôt hold yourself to the standards of a functioning person! Accept that the episode is happening, and accept that for a bit, winning may be just as simple as taking care of basic necessities or accomplishing a single, small task. 

Giving 100% as a functioning person and giving 100% as a depressed person are *not* the same thing. We tell ourselves that we‚Äôre pathetic, weak, and not good enough, when in fact, were fighting harder than the functioning people, it just looks like less. 

Im proud if you can keep your head above water, because that takes a lot of strength. Trying in whatever capacity we can is enough. 

Hang in there "
am I suicidal even if I know I won't kill myself?,"Sorry I don't usually post so this might be kind of sloppy. for starters, I am not going to kill myself. I care too much about other peoples feelings. And my cats. But all my mind can think of is how nice it would be to be dead. I've been depressed like this one other time in my life, but this is the first time I have seriously considered self harm-I guess as a way to escape the internal pain? I haven't taken any steps to self harm but I have a strong urge to do so. I just want everything to end. I have no drive to do anything. I'm irritable as fuck. Nothing is going right and even if it was I probably wouldn't acknowledge it. Idk how to get out of this mindset-I have absolutely no urge to change anything, which is what everyone keeps telling me to do. I've tried to look for psychiatrists and psychologist's but its super fucking hard in this mental state and there's a shit ton of steps to just get on the waiting list, and finding someone who takes my insurance etc.... My question is whether or not this is still considered suicidal, even though I know I won't end my life, I would just like to. Anyone else experience this?"
"In case you don't get to hear it today, i love you!","As arbitrary as it sounds coming from some random internet dude, we all deserve some love. Some piece of mind a feeling that we are not alone even if you feel that way. Even if there isn't positivity in your real life, you deserve to be loved, so i love you, everyone have a blessed morning. Try positivity and stay strong."
I cant look at her anymore,"Posted at r/depression as well, looking to get maybe support or reassurance from strangers. Or just more people to vent to
After recently moving in with my significant other weve had a nice life, a nice two bedroom apartment with a nice area. She moved from the other side of the state was out of a job cause of the move. No big deal. That was November 2019. As of March 2020 shes tried and tried and tried but she has yet to find anything, which is ok. Were at the point of struggling, and in my mind I cant ask for help from my parents because I'm self destructive and too stubborn. My job doesnt pay nearly enough. Our apartment is a mess, I'm overworked, tired, our bed remains broken cause it's made of cheap material. We sleep on couches. I give her the bigger one despite being a foot shorter than me. I'm in over my head. I'm forgetting things, I'm trying to escape. Shes holding up fine and trying to be positive, but I can hardly look at her. I feel like I've failed. I failed her, I failed us, I failed myself. I sit here on my couch looking out the window, crying, but not too loudly as to disturb her. Knowing she deserves better. I just want to jump off the balcony so she can have a better life"
I just need to put this somewhere,"I really want to die right now and even the things that are going well in my life are bringing me nothing but distress. I want to die, I won't because I have a sense of duty to the people that it would hurt but.. I'm literally just going for the sake of going right now."
SUBREDDIT HAS BEEN REOPENED,"Due to the vast variety of posts we received here on depression\_help, we moved over to r/overcoming to broaden the topics and provide support for more than just those with depression.

We have decided to reopen this subreddit, but solely for depression; however, r/overcoming will continue and we still encourage you to post there as well."
Even being awake is too much effort,Normally on the weekend I feel ok but now I still feel exhausted. Even typing this is hard. Caffeine just makes me jittery. I just want to sleep.
I went to a new psychiatrist today,"And I loved it.
He made me feel so much better about my guilt.
All my friends and family say that I should try harder, that are people out there with high functioning depression, and I have to make more of an effort.

 I always feel awful about that and I believe them

But he told me that this is a disease like diabetes, not all people have the same type of diabetes, and the treatment is not the same to everyone. 

Lack of will power and extreme guilt are symptoms of depression, and there is nothing I can do.... except the treatment. 

As long as I'm treating myself, I'm doing the best I can. 

I moved to another country so I'm 1 year without therapy, and I just changed meds when I was visiting my family  during the holidays, I should have gone to a psychiatric here last month to check, but I didn't. 

He up the dosis of my meds and will suggest me a therapist.

I treat my depression for 7 years, I heard that all before, but when everyone is saying the same thing over and over again it's easy to forget.

If you have depression and are not being treated, you really should. 
That friend that said that had depression after the break up and ""cured"" themselves, so you also don't need a treatment? wasn't depressed, just sad. 
If you don't have money, you can find free help in universities or institutions, it may be far and a bit inconvenient, but is so worth it.

It takes a while for you to find the right medication, but when you find it, the world changes. For real. 
and therapy is so important, I don't know how I survived 1 year without it. 


Fun fact: when he asked me who told me those things about how I should try harder and that are people out there who has depression and still work and go to school, I said that nobody told me that.

I don't know why I lied.

Ok, not that fun. 

I just want to encourage anyone here who is avoiding treatment. You should try it, please. 
It really does help. 

Treat yo self"
Feeling unattractive makes my depression worse,What do you guys do when / if you feel unattractive? Are my chances at getting people to be interested in me ruined?

Helped me,Hi. I have been dealing with depression for most of my life. I have frequent thoughts of suicide. One thing I found that has helped me greatly is knitting. The repetition of the stitches helps keep me grounded. I usually make something for someone else and it makes me happy to do that. A lot of hospitals will take small hats for the preemies. If you start out with something easy (like a scarf) and work your way to more challenging pieces it makes a difference. There are a TON of videos on YouTube about beginner knitting. You can purchase inexpensive yarn and needles online. Give it a try!
I feel so alone someone please help me.,I feel like such a baby. I downloaded Reddit yesterday because I have no one to talk to about what's going on in my head. I hoping someone can understand me. Because no one seems to right now.
"At 21 years old I have finally shaken the intense, horrifying spell of anxiety and depression I'd had since I was 18. Now I just have to clean up the mess that it caused in my life.","For 3 years, I lived in constant fear. Constant pain. A horror i hadn't imagined possible until l lived it. Long story short, I found my way out. I figured out how to live again. The only issue is that now, at 21, I'm a college dropout with few friends and no marketable skills beyond speaking Spanish. The one thing weighing on me now is the time that I lost. 3 years of my youth that I'll never get back. I'd love to hear from anyone who has had a similar experience and has advice about overcoming thoughts of regret about time lost. Thank you."

HI I'm depressed and unmotivated,Story of my life. Bye.
Beginning to get bad thoughts again,"I found out yesterday that My aunt relapsed and is now only alive because of life support, and if this next test comes back negotiable they have to pull the plug, and with everything that‚Äôs been going on in my personal life, I really don‚Äôt think I can handle it, I need some help"
I'm at a loss (NSFW),"I guess I'll start from the beginning.
I know I don't have it anywhere as hard as anyone else, but I guess I'm extremely weak.

When I was young, my mom and dad had shared custody. My mom had me only as a way to try and trap my dad. (It didn't work, he didn't even want kids and didn't have any interest in marrying her regardless)
When I was at her apartment, I would see drug use, a lot. Of course I didn't understand what it was at the time but as I've grown older I know what was going on. She had a boyfriend named Michael. He molested me periodically from the age of 4-6 (with her knowledge, she fucking watched). Everything from before that point in my life is a gigantic haze. My dad knew something was going on, but I didn't tell him. (I couldn't, at the time Michael had said he would hurt my mom and dad, and I didn't want anything to happen to either of them) 

I guess he decided enough was enough and gained full custody of me. Shelled out the thousands of dollars he had to, to gain full custody of me. At that point I had a lot of emotional confusion, and feelings I guess?  I started getting in trouble in school, and had to be moved to species education in third grade for being hyper aggressive. I began counseling for my anger and for years didn't understand the point of talking about my problems. Why talk about it, if I couldn't be helped I guess. I continually got in trouble in school, and by 5th grade I had been charged with simple battery. I would continue to get in trouble and be charged throughout school, would spend time in YDC. At the age of 13, when I was being questioned buy the SRO when I was in handcuffs I finally caved and talked vaguely about my molestation. I had been trying to suppress those memories and when I first talked about it everything rushed back. The feelings and all. A fucking floodgate had been opened and I didn't know what the hell it was. 

A month or so later, I had taken all of my medication and tried to end my life. I guess that was the first time I fully had and understanding of wanting to die. I had to have my stomach pumped and went to a psychiatric facility for 24 hours after I had been sent there from the hospital. I wasn't up front, I was so disgusted and intimidated by being there that I told them I did it for attention and they let me go. Mind you, I talked my fucking way out of that place in 24 hours after ingesting all of my medication.

At my hearing for another battery charge a couple months later, I was ordered by the state to have a psychological evaluation or I would become a ward to the state. So I caved and went through every detail of my molestation over the course of six hours. I felt so disgusted with myself, I wanted to die even more than when I had taken all of my medications. I went into the ""why me?"" phase. I was mad at the world, mad at God and to this day I still am.

The psychologist had diagnosed me with PTSD, depression, anxiety, separation anxiety, insomnia, and auditory schizophrenia. The fucking rollercoaster just kept worsening because I had finally talked. Why? There was no benefit, talking was pointless. So they began intensive therapy and trying different medications. At that point, I was back in school and fighting more, because SOMEHOW kids had found out. Being called a fucking retard is one thing, but people ridiculing me for what had happened made me angrier. 

That's when I fully understood what schizophrenia was. Only one person had said anything about my early childhood, however it was almost like it was the whole class, I had gotten into a fight and was arrested. When sitting in a holding cell, waiting for my dad to pick me up I genuinely realized that the voices were in my head. I decided that I didn't want to hear anything and began slamming my head against the wall and had knocked myself out and given myself a concussion. When I had came to and was going to the hospital; I fully understood what was wrong.

It took a couple of years, and at the age of 15 I was starting to mellow out. Then, I realized that I only had one testicle. My grandmother had taken me to the doctor and it appeared that my left testicle never descended. I had surgery and had to have it removed. The doctor ended up telling my dad that it was blocked by scarring of some sort. Which i don't understand unless it came from my molestation.

I came to from my anaesthesia, and they asked how I felt. I only asked about my teste as dumb as it sounds. When they told me they had to remove it I sobbed my ass off, and they gave me some strong medication for sleep. This is when I understood how selfish my father could be. 

Because of my emotional stability they wanted me to rest so I could be monitored, my dad told me ""you can't go to sleep, we don't want to get caught in traffic."" Traffic, traffic of all fucking things. So I fought through whatever they had given me and they decided to send me home.

Fast forward to 16, I had woken up a morning before school and had it in my head that I wanted to die. So before I got on the bus, I had eaten all of my adderall, the hydrocodone I had saved from my surgery, my respirdal, lamictal, abilify, and whatever else I was on and went to school. I figured it would have killed me before I had actually got to school. I got to school and staggered off, and fell down. They helped me in the school and could tell something was wrong and called my grandmother. The nurse told her to check to see if I had taken something as I was showing signs of overdosing. Everything is a haze, but apparently they made me vomit and no medication they could tell came up. So I went to the hospital and they pumped my stomach. Everything for the next few days is a haze and I went to a psychiatric facility for a week. That's all my insurance would let me do, I decided I wanted help, only for my insurance to limit it. Whatever, I got out and they altered my medication. They had managed to get the voices for the most part to stop, but I was dealing with everything else the best way possible.

At the age of 17, I graduated a year early and my insurance lapsed as I was no longer in school. I had to use what I learn to keep everything from worsening. I haven't done anything since, I'm 22 and have been unmedicated the entire time. Now, and i don't know why now but everything has substantially gotten worse in the last 3 days. I can't afford help, I don't have insurance and I'm so fucking close to blowing my brains out. I don't know what to do, I can't figure out what i can do and I'm just alone.

If anyone can give me an idea of what I can do for immediate help, I'm in Georgia. Everything I've looked at tells me to go to the hospital, but I can't. If I go, I'll lose my job, my apartment, my truck. Everything, I need help but now that I want it I can't fucking get it.."
Sick of everything,"I hate to post stuff like this on the internet but fuck it I guess.

I'm just sick of everything, I want to live life to the fullest but there seems to be something always in the way of it, like intrusive thoughts that just mess with me. I try to ignore them but sometimes they seem stronger than me.

And today, to make matters worse I just received my first test of the year (I'm in high school btw) and I was very disappointed with my grade, which makes me depressed because it makes me feel like I'll never be anyone in life. In the past I've always had good grades but I don't even know anymore. I just seriously hope this phase of my life goes away."
Regret is suffocating,"How do you deal with regret you spent the ""best years of your life "" (18-25) just crying? I didn't really have a lot of fun then. I just focused on passing school.
What sucks is that only now i realize what i could have been. I had horrible self-eestem issues. I couldn't even look at guys i liked. I only got a boyfriend now, but it really bothers me that i have no experience with love and now im in an age where people around me look to settle down while i only really am just discovering what relationships are like. It's like im only now going trough puberty when i should be getting serious. Soon i won't be young anymore and i feel like i never really experienced what 'young' is in that carefree way of self discovery"
"i think my friend is about to give up, and she is distancing herself from the people that can help","so i have this friend,
she is my best friend,
she has depression and is in a real bad spot right now.

we both finished high school last year,
and she thinks she is driffiting away from our friend group,
yesterday she blocked all of us on twitter,
i think i am the only one that noticed so far,
and she has been saying things like, ""no one can help me"", or ""i don't think they like me"" and ""i feel nothing for them"",
i am trying to convince her that it isn't true, that they do like her, because i know they do.

i have always been doing the most that i can,
trying to be supportive and saying stuff like, ""i am here if you need"" and things like that,
but it isn't as effective because i am currently living in the other side of the planet for my studies,
(we are both brazilians but i am doing an exchange program in canada, if you care)
after i confirmed that she blocked all of us, i told the situation to 2 other close friends of her, and they didn't know how bad she was until now.

so i'll just ask a few questions to anyone that cares to answer:
did i do the right thing telling the situation to other people??
is there anything else that i can do??
is there a dedicated sub for people that aren't depressed but want to help friends that are??

sorry for the formating and spelling mistakes, english is not my first language, i am on mobile and i am feeling a little bit desperate about the whole situation."
Need a shoulder to lean on your welcome here,Here to help i dont care about your race age or sex im here to help and if i can't please remember im only human and im trying my best
They say god removes people from your life for the better... too bad I was the one he removed,"I miss my wife, I miss being a husband, I miss having our family under one house. I regret taking her for granted I lost the family I married into who accepted me and loved me for who I was never judging unlike my family. I lost it all and I have no one to blame but myself. I realized that they don‚Äôt respond to texts because they hate me but because I alienated myself so bad that they don‚Äôt want to deal with me."
"Please, I need some help‚ù§Ô∏èüôè","Hey y‚Äôall! I hope you guys are having a great dayüôè I hope that you keep on reading this please. This is my long-ass story that I hope you take the time to read :

I‚Äôve stopped having suicidal thoughts for a few weeks now and I thought I would be able to recover without having any help or any therapy sessions at all. But just last night, I had trouble breathing again and this time no-one was around. I was all alone in my room with my aunt downstairs and my dog beside me trying her best to do what she can to calm me down (cause I think deep down my dog senses that something‚Äôs not right w/ me). I‚Äôve had scenarios like these before. The first time, and I remember it so DISTINCTLY was when I sang up on stage alongside my choirmates and I was the soloist at the beginning of the piece and I forgot the first note, so I sang the whole piece a note lower so it affected my choirmates and they got confused and they couldn‚Äôt sing along and it was embarrassing. But the worst part was when a male teacher went to me, scolded me, and said ‚ÄúHow could you be so selfish?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou messed up big time‚Äù and he just made me feel like shit. He gave us this look that he would give to people who were worthless to him and I approached him and he gave me that look, but I disregarded it and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for being selfish sir‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt answer me. At all. And later, I realized that he had talked with all of my choirmates and had asked them what they learned from this experience. And one of my closest friends went to me and that‚Äôs when I lost it. I couldn‚Äôt breathe for hours and I just kept on sobbing and screaming. He just walked away. The next occurance like this was when this time, my aunt called. I was at our school cafeteria at the time. Both she and I don‚Äôt have a great relationship because whenever she‚Äôs in a bad mood, she would mutter the words ‚ÄúYour siblings were never as bad as you‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better if you just leave‚Äù ‚ÄúLeche ka. Buwiset ka.‚Äù - those are Filipino words that mean that I‚Äôm annoying and such. And I went inside a bathroom stall and I started crying. When I went out, one of my guy friends had asked me if I was okay and that‚Äôs when I snapped and he gave me a seat and he held my hand and I just started squeezing it because I wasn‚Äôt able to breathe for hours and our friends were there too trying to give me water and telling me to count until 10. I started telling them that I couldn‚Äôt feel anything. My legs, my hands, my guy friend‚Äôs hands, nothing. And I couldn‚Äôt speak properly. It had been 3 hours already and so I just told them that I was okay and I still couldn‚Äôt breathe but I‚Äôll be fine. But when we got to the nurse‚Äôs office, I sat back down because I literally was feeling like I was on drugs or something bc I was getting so dizzy and lightheaded and I couldn‚Äôt get up anymore. They started bringing in an oxygen tank and gave me a pink pill and they said that it was supposed to knock me out, but it did nothing of the sort, so they admitted me to the ER and they rubbed something on me and I fell asleep. The 3rd occurance was last night. I‚ÄôM SORRY for this long-ass thing, but if you‚Äôre still reading, bless youüôè 

Last night, my teacher had told me that I messed up my project and IT WAS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT ONE, like literally, but I really flunked it. So I couldn‚Äôt breathe for hours and hours and hours and I started throwing the pillows at the wall because my chest hurt so bad and I was all alone and my friends weren‚Äôt here to calm me down or get me some help and stuff. What eventually calmed me down was when my dog jumped up my bed and just looked at me. Right now, I have a blade and it‚Äôs not cutting my skin like at all. I‚Äôm afraid to get some therapy because my parents believe that its only for crazy people. Do you guys think I need therapy? What are your thoughts after reading all of this? Thank you for taking the time and reaching this far. I‚Äôd appreciate it if y‚Äôall commented something down below because I really need summ help right now. Do y‚Äôall experience this stuff to? Because when my parents found out about me not being able to breathe and being admitted to the hospital, they said maybe I was having a stroke or might probably be getting the coronavirus symptoms. But I was tested and it wasn‚Äôt a stroke or the coronavirus. They said I hyperventilated. Do y‚Äôall experience that too? Or am I just over-analyzing my situations? Stay safe y‚Äôallüôè"
"Fianc√©‚Äôs depression is getting bad, not sure how to help/navigate","My fianc√© has always suffered from depression but as of late he said it‚Äôs gotten worse. I‚Äôve also taken noticed because he‚Äôs been getting especially aggressive lately. He can be hurtful and when I try to point it out to him the mean things he‚Äôs said to me that I don‚Äôt appreciate, he goes on the defensive and feels like i‚Äôm attacking him and deflects the issue. This has cause multiple arguments that have really put a strain on our relationship but I refuse to give up on him. Overall he‚Äôs become more irritable, angrier, and his mood changes quickly. How can I navigate around his anger while also have him recognize the consequences of his outbursts? 

I‚Äôm also unsure of how to help him in terms of making him feel better. Our mutual friend has told me that he confided in her that he feels unworthy of love. I try my best to make him feel loved everyday but maybe there is something I‚Äôm missing. What are some ideas your SO‚Äôs have come up with that have made you feel better or what is something you would like for yourself? or something that you yourself have done that helped you in the past that I can recommend to him?"
Not realizing that it is just my mood,"Hey, I wanted to reach out and see if others experience something similar. 
When i am in bad mood, the world is collapsing and I feel as if I am in bad spot in life,  there is nothing to look forward, etc. at those moments I am in like a ‚Äúdream state‚Äù and I do do not realise that until the  feeling lifts, that it was just my bad toughts and it is not the reality. This dark phase usually does not last longer that one day, but when it does it becomes my whole reality. 
Does any of you also do not realize it is just a bad feeling and will pass until it has?
I hope i make sense with what i just said..."
"Ex GF was my life, now what's the point?","  

I posted my story on another sub for some support. Feel free to read it‚Ä¶it‚Äôs long. I am just feeling very depressed today. ""Depressed"" being an understatement. She was my world. We were going to get married and have a life together. Had our kids name picked out. She told me she couldn‚Äôt imagine her life without me. Now she‚Äôs posting pictures with the guy she cheated on me and left me for saying how amazing he is. He‚Äôs a loser, no job, no education, can‚Äôt support her. I would have given her the world. She threw away 7 years together and all our love and memories for a guy she had only known for a few weeks. It kills me.

She doesn‚Äôt love me. She‚Äôll never come back to me. What‚Äôs the point anymore? I don‚Äôt care about having a good job or having ‚Äúa lot going for me‚Äù. The one thing I want in life I can‚Äôt have. Her. She was my everything. I don‚Äôt want someone else. I literally don‚Äôt care about anything in my life anymore. I hate everything. I hate myself. I lost her. I treated her so well but it just wasn‚Äôt enough. And now she‚Äôs gone. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just wake up, go to work, go to the gym, go to bed and repeat. Every day is the same and my partner is now happy with someone else. What am I supposed to do? I feel broken. Thanks in advance."
I sent a message to my father...,"On 6th February, 2019 at 4:47am I watched my father take his last breath on his bedroom floor of my childhood home. To say that things moved on quickly is a severe understatement. Right now, it's 3:35am and I have been awake for the last 95 mins just wanting to hear my father's voice. To know that all that I'm doing for my own family is enough; that I'm not a failure as a son or as a husband or father. Sure, my wife tells me that I'm not a failure, but it's not the same. I just want to hear my father's reassurance one more time. 

&#x200B;

I can't find a voicemail or a video. Not a single one and it's crushing me more and more. So I sent him a message on facebook since I know his cell phone is long disconnected and his number more than likely recycled. I'm sure my mother will read this as she is the one that has taken over his account since his passing, but I just really want to hear something attached to his name or his face right now.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if this isn't the proper place for things, my mind has travelled back to that morning when I was getting ready for work and I get a phone call that something has happened to my father and that I should get there quickly... Sometimes I wish that I could be more open about these feelings with my own spouse or those close to me rather than random strangers on the internet, but I still feel like I need to be the strong one. Not only for my two children, but for my 5 older siblings and our mother as well."
passively suicidal,"i feel like i‚Äôve been passively suicidal since a very early age with moments of being actively suicidal. what i mean by this is that i‚Äôm pretty much wanting to die at any moment but not always to the point of actually doing anything about it. i can‚Äôt live like this anymore. i know it‚Äôll still happen occasionally, but i just want some time where i don‚Äôt wish i were dead. i don‚Äôt know my dudes. i just feel so lost. 

edit: i really appreciate all the support. it‚Äôs nice to feel not alone. i hope you all know i support all of you too. 

edit: i‚Äôm looking for a new therapist so hopefully i can find a good match and start the process of coping. i‚Äôve previously had a couple (one moved, one was a complicated situation and i had to leave after she failed to report that i had been raped and i was still a minor). i have major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder following being raped at 16. "
I'm so afraid that I've messed everything up already,"... And that I can no longer make something of myself anymore. For a little background, I'm a man in my early 20's living in a country where a diploma pretty much makes or breaks your future. From a very young age I was already pegged for success and things were going well but the problem was that as I grew older I just became more and more depressed. 2 1/2 years into a pre-med course, I met some like-minded individuals who also weren't happy and we decided to fuck everything up. A failed suicide attempt and a whole semester out of school later I went back to uni now in an English course which screwed me over after 1 1/2 semester as they changed the curriculum and required me to go back to freshman year. I lost the courage and the patience. I've been out of school for a whole year now and I've been faking it to the people I know by editing my grades on the internet. Now I've fallen out of touch with my parents because I've disappointed them too much and I'm stuck in a joyless career which is neither meaningful or helping me grow. I also have a girlfriend who means the world to me who's older and is taking her Doctorate. She's expecting me to finish anytime soon, get a real career and finally settle down. I feel like everyone's expecting something from me that I can't deliver. I've done fucked up so much that I don't even know where to begin fixing things. Honestly, I don't even know what has kept me going. Back in late 2018 I attempted suicide. Before 2019 ended I promised that I won't reach the New Year. But oddly enough I'm still here but I'm afraid I might finally burnout. I haven't sought help since my attempt since it was the meds that I tried to do it with. I just wish my future didn't revolve around a piece of paper so much or at the very least I wish I was able to do things right the very first time around."
"Depression getting worse, can't get treatment soon, and going broke","Long story short since escaping an abusive parent that financially supported me I've been jobless and I'm running out of money (don't worry I'm not asking for any money, just advice). This is a time in my life where I need to double down, try and get a job, and get my shit together. Because if I don't I'll literally won't be able to pay my bills and live, right? 

Well that last part is certainly true. But ever since three months ago I've had a terrible depression (and also symptoms of ptsd) and it's been getting worse. I always feel empty, unmotivated, and tired. Things I used to enjoy I don't anymore. I don't really feel much of anything lately except for emptiness, boredom, and sometimes anger. I'm 100% certain I have ptsd and depression but can't get a diagnosis until I get an appointment with a psychiatrist and that'll take a month with my free public health insurance. So not only am I not able to function with my depression with things like eating and sleeping let alone job seeking, I'm in a situation where I can't immediately get help *and* where if I don't get a job within the next month I'll be fucked. Is there any way I can cope or did method I can do to get myself mentally sound enough to get a job, at least until I can get the treatment I need? I'm just do overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. Thanks guys."
Year 23 of wanting to free fall off of a cliff,"I‚Äôm so sick and tired of being alive, every year it gets worse and worse, I think about wanting to kill myself every day at this point. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck there‚Äôs no chance for me to ever get better, I don‚Äôt have the money to move, and I also don‚Äôt have a car. No friends, no family to go to, this all feels more like hell and I‚Äôm ready to just go and never come back."
what keeps me going,"i know it sounds babyish, but Pokemon really keeps my spirits up.
World of Warcraft, Diablo, Osu!, Overwatch, Music, and many, many other things keep me happy.
Pokemon is something I can just dl and emulator for or play online. Something that I could do on my phone. World of Warcraft is a game I've played since BC since my father started playing when I was born, it's a game I have memories with and have so many good friends I've known for 6+ years because that's when I had the confidence to talk to people. And they're around my age! We still talk but can't play together because my computer broke :( 
I find joy in videogames, and nature. 
I know this is horribly structured but it's just something I needed to say because I know my IRL friends would judge me"
"I feel so lost, I don't know how much more I have left in me","I'm a 50 year old male with a 10 year old daughter (shared custody with the ex).  I spent most of my life as a high functioning person and was always in the top 10% of the population income wise.  I've had issues (depression, eating disorders) since I was a kid but I was always able to ""handle"" it and stay high functioning.  Then, over 6 months, I lost my job after 25 years and with the end of my paycheque, so ended my marriage.  That was it, I had no strength left to put up my front and I dropped quickly into a deep depression.

&#x200B;

Well 5 years later I'm divorced, still unemployed, completely broke and barely surviving financially, have panic attacks when I try to job search, and have zero confidence left in myself.  I feel like a total and complete failure in every aspect of my life.  I even feel like a horrible father because some days I can barely handle the normal stresses of dealing with a young kid and I give into her too often which is leading her down some bad paths health and habit wise.  Almost all my friends are gone.  My supposed best friend left me not long after she saw me at my absolute worst when I was in the hospital after an aborted suicide attempt.   She decided our 20 year friendship meant nothing because I ""must always have been a secret narcissist"".  When she left, two of my other very close friends went with her since they were closer to her and felt uncomfortable staying my friend given her feelings.  Other friends I wasn't as close with disappeared when I was slow to reply to them during bouts of depression.  They decided I didn't care or wasn't worth it.  Some just didn't know how to deal with me when I was always down and they had known me as the up guy who was always there to support others.

I have nothing left.  There is nothing inside of me.  I want to die all the time. I've been though treatment.  3 doctors, 2 hospital visits, multiple drugs, TMS treatments, ECT treatments, day therapy programs, DBT/CBT training, anything they wanted me to try I did.  Nothing.  I move between moderately depressed on the best day to severely depressed on an average day.  What joys I get last only for a few minutes before I go dead inside again.  My latest doctor when I showed some optimism about trying to change said ""its not realistic to expect you will ever be back to near where you once were again"" and that he discouraged me from even trying to find work.  I can't live feeling like I have no purpose but leaching off of society and not even having enough to do the things that are important to me.  No money, no job, no friends, what's left?

The only thing that's held me back for the past year is my daughter.  She's 10.  She is all that matters to me.  I don't want to desert her, but I often question if I add anything to her life anyway.  And its hard to live for ""every other week"" with someone especially when those weeks can be so hard mentally.  

&#x200B;

I don't know why I'm writing this except to vent.  The truth is I don't think its ""will I kill myself"" but when."
I seriously considered cutting myself last night.,"My depression comes in waves, but last night was especially bad. I can't properly describe it, but I could not stop crying. And this happens almost all the time. No matter what I do or how I distract myself, the pain always comes back. It's why whenever I get done with a walk or finish doing something fun, I start crying again. I think it's getting worse. Nothing I used to feel better was enough anymore. I wanted to take a knife and carve the ache out of my chest, but it doesn't work that way.

So I thought about cutting myself. I always wondered what it would be like, but never seriously considered it until last night. I even went as far as getting a knife. I got scratched by my cat before so I figured if it was anything like that it wouldn't be a big deal. And cutting supposedly took away from the emotional pain, so it would be worth it. I ultimately didn't do it. Mostly because summer is coming, and I'd have to wear short sleeves. Also because I chickened out. I would like to say I'm proud for not doing it, but I'm mostly just upset and angry. I'm tired of this. As hard as it is living with depression, I never understood why anyone would want to cut. Now I do.

I know no one will care, I just wanted to get this out."
Being the boyfriend.,"My Girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 6 years. She has suicidal thoughts occasionally. She tells me I am very supportive and a great bf but sometimes I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm giving the best support. 

(Sorry for the long post. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs any other SOs in this thread or if there is another sub I should be posting in) 

I don‚Äôt have anyone I can talk to about this. After about a year into dating, while we were cleaning dishes in her apartment, she let on how serious her depression was when she told me that she had once held a gun to her head. After a long silence we both cried and I told her how much I loved her. She told me that she had only ever told her best friend and didn‚Äôt want anyone to know, so I‚Äôve never told anyone, not even my closest friend of 15+ years whom I share anything and everything with. So thank you to whomever shares any words of wisdom you‚Äôre all I got. 

Over the the last year our relationship has dwindled, we still tell each other we love each other constantly and talk about getting engaged/married. But we don‚Äôt have conversations like we used to, she always falls asleep on the couch so we don‚Äôt sleep together hardly, we don‚Äôt have sex at all, I think 6 times total last year, that has been a big point of frustration at least for me - I‚Äôve tried to initiate sex and been shot down so many times that I‚Äôve all but given up at this point, even when it‚Äôs your lover, your best friend, it still feels like crap when you get rejected. I‚Äôve tried to talk to her about it many times the day after or some time that is away from sex so we can have a calm conversation about it but everyone so far, every time we have talked she‚Äôs gotten worked up and basically says she doesn‚Äôt feel like it. We both have HPV so sometimes that gets in the way but whenever we‚Äôve talked it‚Äôs always that she‚Äôs not in the mood. I feel like she‚Äôs not telling me something. 

I feel as if we‚Äôve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me. I get paranoid that she‚Äôs cheating on me sometimes, which I highly doubt she is, I think it‚Äôs just me trying to rationalize the lack of sex. Most of all I feel like this entire relationship is about her, and it‚Äôs frustrating me lately. I honestly don‚Äôt mean to sound like a jerk here; I‚Äôm certainly not entitled to anything and while I know her story better than anyone I have no idea what it was really like to experience those traumas growing up and how it effects her today. 

I don‚Äôt even know how to explain how I‚Äôm feeling. I‚Äôm constantly having the internal debate: ‚ÄúWell what about me?‚Äù- ‚ÄúFuck about you! What about her!?‚Äù And so on. While writing this post I kind of caught myself switching between my 2 head-spaces.

Headspace A: 
‚ÄúThat being said.. why can‚Äôt it be about me sometimes? Shouldn‚Äôt a relationship be 50/50? I‚Äôve really never been an attention seeker so I‚Äôm fine with 30/70 or 20/80? Anything at this point. It‚Äôs not though, everything we do is dictated by her depression.‚Äù

Headspace B:
‚ÄúA few weeks ago while I was alone doing laundry I just started hysterically crying I couldn‚Äôt breathe, it really freaked me out. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. Earlier that day she had called me crying and saying ‚Äúshe just wants it to be over. She just wants to give up. She wants to die‚Äù I love her so much and i‚Äôm scared for her and for us.‚Äù

Am I just a shitty person for wanting it to be about me sometimes? I feel like a prick even saying that. Of course I‚Äôve never told her about this, she has enough to worry about and I want to be her rock, not another burden, a toddler, whining about not getting enough attention. So I don‚Äôt say anything, instead I just get distant, which I recognize and I hate that I do that. I‚Äôm just angry at this situation and don‚Äôt know how else to react. 

I want our relationship to be what it once was; fun and exciting. How can I help this relationship? How do I bring up my inner man-child who needs her attention or do I bring it up at all? 

Thanks so much for any help.

Edit: I meant to include this in the post and a lot of you have asked. She is currently taking medication to help with the anxiety and so far it has been working pretty well I think but she still definitely has sad days. Her doctor said if the meds don‚Äôt help then she could put her in touch with a therapist. Also taking any suggestions on the best way to find a therapist. Gf is hoping to get one recommended by the primary dr so it is covered by insurance. "
How do you get back into the working world with severe depression and anxiety?,"I‚Äôve been out of work since August when I had a major breakdown and attempted suicide in September. I‚Äôm on new meds and back in therapy. I want to find something part time and ease myself back into things but I find myself panicking at the thought of human interaction outside of my small circle. 

I‚Äôm able to mostly go to the store, run errands, etc without a panic attack now. The depression is better but still bad. But I have such a hard time functioning normally (smiling, responding appropriately, etc.) with the public that idk how I‚Äôm going to manage a job. But I hate not working, not providing for myself and my kids, and I need to find a job again soon. "
"For anyone with depression, anxiety, low self esteem who struggles everyday...","I want you to know you are not alone. I think about suicide a few times a day. I don't have a tight knit friend group, just one-on-one relationships. I have trouble connecting with people as I am always worried what they think. I am overemotional, sensitive and have very low self esteem. Although I feel like giving up... alot. I do not want to. I do not want to harm myself and let the last thing I do hurt everyone that loves me. Life isn't about being perfectly happy all the time. Let the pain rush over you and do not fight it. Once you allow yourself to feel it, you will begin to heal. Fear and paranoia consume my life. I watch others live in peace jealously, but every once in a while I realize they struggle too. Find something that makes you happy and do it. Don't compare yourself (as much as you can) Sending you love and support. "
"i feel bad everytime i complain and rant a little, so i just push it down my throat and not bother people with my issues.","when i was around 16 i used to be a crying nagging self centered kid who bitch about everything but later i learned that i was annoying people and its better to keep it for your self.

now i have alot boiling up inside of me but i cant vent about it cuz its so so much and i dont want to annoy people with my complains specially there few people who depend on me and i have to be the calm mature strong person for them."
don't give up on your mental health (grateful for helping friend) - Day 131,"[Mental health issues? Just don't give up](https://youtu.be/k-w6dH9Xicw)

It's 10 o'clock at night, it's icy cold, and all afternoon I've been helping a friend move house.

I certainly don't want to be making a Gratitude Bridge video right now.

I haven't missed one in 130 days, so I'm not missing one today.

Gratitude Bridge is vital for my mental health, my recovery.

The discipline of this project has helped me more than anything else I've done.

today, I am grateful for helping a friend and not giving up

What are you grateful for?

*This is part of my 365 days of gratitude to work through my depression and the spiral into suicide attempts over the last two years. I have been posting a video daily on Youtube and Depression on my journey to get out of Depression 'Gratitude Bridge'*"
Is it okay to drop a class for the sake of my own health?,"So I am currently in college. I am in my second semester as a freshman (first year) and I am an undecided major. I was leaning towards computer science or graphic design, but this CS170 class is stressing me out. The class by itself doesn't sound too bad. But thinking about the homework, which the professor warned could take up to 6 hours outside of class to complete, is what stresses me out. When I think about my other classes like Religious Studies, World History, Geology, and Design, I don't think I can handle the work load of CS170 PLUS the workload of the other classes. I know that this is a stupid request and will probably be removed, but I'm the kind of person that relies on advice before deciding something important like this. Any advice could be helpful. Please and Thank You."
"My depression has been beating a retreat for the past 22 days, but I fear she's resting and gaining strength to try to take me back down. She better be ready, I'm fighting.","After 2 years for severe depression, and denial of said depression, I decided to try to use all the tools I've gained from therapy and pop psych.

Part of me is getting worried since I've been relatively okay since 2019 started.  Bit of sadness, self hate and regret crept in.  Thinking of ways I could've been a better daughter to my dying mother, and sister to my dying brother, and friend to my dying ex-boyfriend and more attentive to my dying father...I was able to force myself out of that doom and remember all I did do.  I forced myself to remember what friends, family, co-workers, and other people said about my devotion and love.

My depression is such a playful, cruel and smart bitch.  It's fucking exhausting to battle that cunning cuntface.

Just want to encourage everyone here to keep up the fight.  Be in your own corner.  

Take care all.

I wish I was the dead twin,"I want friends. I want a lover. I want some sort of relationship where I feel comfortable. I‚Äôm so tired of being alone. I‚Äôm so tired of being me. Im tired of being an asshole, a dick, a bitch, a monster. I‚Äôm tired of being like my father. Hearing the hate CONSTANTLY can be overwhelming sometimes. I never saw myself as being mean, but I guess it‚Äôs just in my DNA. And for that reason, I don‚Äôt think I can ever truly love myself.  I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe. Like everything I say or do is immediately going to be shut down and served right back at me. I‚Äôm never good enough anymore, I‚Äôm not funny anymore, I‚Äôm not happy anymore. I think at this point I‚Äôve been told so much that I‚Äôm awful, I‚Äôve come to believe it. I now know that I was never good enough to begin with. That I am a disappointment, a loser, a bitch, and the most notable, an empty bottomless pit of regret. I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôve proven you wrong. I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt turn out right, or even just the way you wanted. I feel like a fraud. Me existing is wrong, I shouldn‚Äôt be here. I should‚Äôve been the miscarriage. I should‚Äôve been the one! It‚Äôs all fucked somehow. Why am I here if I‚Äôm meant to be alone?"
How do I tell my friends and family that I am depressed?,"I am 21 years old, I‚Äôve been dealing with depression ever since high school but never discussed it with anyone until this year. Last semester I visited my school‚Äôs counseling center because I just felt so shitty. 

My depression comes in waves, so it comes and goes (which is partly the way I‚Äôve been able to hide it for so long) but when It‚Äôs bad I spend hours just convincing myself to shower or brush my teeth. I feel so unmotivated and unhappy. 

I finally saw a counselor and explained everything I have been feeling and she suggested that I see a psychiatrist. I really want to because I don‚Äôt know if I can get through another episode and I feel one coming on soon, but I don‚Äôt know how to tell my mom that I need to see one. I am still on my parents insurance plan so they will find out regardless. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to tell my parents or my friends. I don‚Äôt want to come off as lazy or sad and I definitely don‚Äôt want them to treat me differently."
My parents are a major source of my desperation/ thoughts of s**f h**m and i have no idea what to doTW: Speaking on s*****e,"Hello.  I‚Äôd like to start by saying I‚Äôm not 100% sure if this is the right subreddit for this and will happily remove if incorrect. So I‚Äôm M 23 and ever since I was a kid my parents (mainly father more recently my mother. Well touch on that) have been a large source of my mental health issues. I‚Äôve discussed this with them multiple times and was constantly told ‚Äúother people have it worse‚Äù or when I break down in tears from everyday life being told ‚Äú he‚Äôs a grown man crying what a cry baby‚Äù

2 months ago I attempted to take my life and was put on short term disability until I was approved to longer be at risk to the company I work for and myself. It‚Äôs the only time I‚Äôve felt they‚Äôve taken the matter seriously until I found out that my mother has been talking about it to her coworkers and other family members without asking me first. 

So until I manage to find an apartment to move into I‚Äôm stuck with in a house where I don‚Äôt even feel welcome in anymore, and have begun to distant myself to the point where all I say is ‚Äúokay‚Äù to any sentence and avoid conversations. I do see a therapist and things are going smoothly. I‚Äôm just at a lose on how to tell them they‚Äôve been a large cause my problems. Not to have them take fault. But for them to understand they‚Äôve done this and to at least attempt(?) to be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù in the future 

Thank you"
I don‚Äôt want to be alive anymore,"I would turn to someone else, if everyone I knew didn‚Äôt absolutely hate me.
I tried therapy. I‚Äôm bad at talking to people. I get scared by talking to adults, despite nearly being one myself. 
I tried being honest with the people I love, but they all say that they‚Äôve had it worse. 
I‚Äôm not exactly someone that‚Äôs easy to get along with, either. I‚Äôm loud, obnoxious, and god, am I stupid. So, that means that I don‚Äôt really have anyone else around to help me, because my god-awful personality drives everyone away.
I tried. I really tried. 
But, trying wasn‚Äôt worth it. 
I‚Äôm just so tired. And every day leaves me more exhausted. I just don‚Äôt want to feel like this anymore. 
I‚Äôm trying one more time, to reach out for support, I mean. I really could use some support, maybe someone to listen, and not make fun of me for everything going on.
Just someone to be there for me would be nice. 
I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm really dumb."
No point on living like this anymore I can't stand loneliness anymore.,"This is really ruining me. I hate myself for being the way I am. A shy introverted guy like myself has no future in this world full of predators ready to harm other in the pursue for success. I really wish I could change how I am, I'd really like to have that common thing wich is the ability to talk to other people and make friendships and getting good jobs and (hate to admit it) have a sex life, I don't even have a sex life, and maybe I shouldn't say that because that could get me labeled as  a creep but whatever, I'm already labeled like that by other people I guess, or maybe I'm just paranoid, I hope so.
Anyway that's the thing. I wish I could change it but honestly I don't want to get hurt in the process. Haha my god. Grow up kid!"
The magic of medication,"I feel comfortable watching the rain.
My medication has gone up and I am starting to notice its positive effect. Now I only struggle through the side effects, but that is a matter of listening to my body ."
Antidepressants withdrawal side effects,"I've been lowering my meds under doctors supervision, stopped taking all meds for about 3 days now. I've experienced a lot of side effects in the past few years since I had started my treatment but this is very bad.

I know there will be side effects after i stopped taking long time meds but it's pretty heavy that i really need it to stop. Massive headache and dizziness. I feel like I'm slower than I normally am and I feel like i need to throw up every time right after i eat something.

Is there any tricks that could ease this suffering?"
Does anyone else ever get to a point where they feel emotionally detached from even the most important people in their life?,"Like, I've never felt so empty or so bad that I just don't care about anyone or anything anymore. I can't even bring myself to see or talk to my bf, who has been my greatest support this year. It's not that anyone's done anything, I just can't feel anything except a crippling emptiness that makes me want to disappear. "
"I am sad, alone and scared.","I‚Äôve never been properly diagnosed with depression but I am currently feeling very depressed. A few years ago when I was younger & my parents were going through a divorce I was severely miserable, would have large bouts of anxiety & often contemplated ending my life. It was a sad time in my life but I am glad to say that I got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. 

However recently I have been feeling really down & depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I eat because I am sad and bored, and then I become sad because I eat too much. I have gained weight and am so insecure. I have been skipping my uni classes because I have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad. With all my friends heading in different directions I just feel so alone. I think my family have noticed and say things that are kind of cruel, but I know they mean well. They think I have obsessive compulsive tendencies because I tend to pick at my face often & struggle to stop.

I just don‚Äôt want to let anyone down & I am afraid to take the steps to become better because I know it will disappoint my family if I decide to leave uni for example. But most importantly I‚Äôm scared of going back to how I was years ago, I never want to feel that way again. I‚Äôve never reached out for professional help either and don‚Äôt have the money for therapy. Part of me would feel also ashamed in a way if I got professional help. I hate the idea that something may actually be wrong with me, and I hate the idea of having to take meds. 

I just feel so lost and conflicted. I feel like I know what I need to do but it‚Äôs so hard to do it and remain consistent. If anyone has any advice at all it would greatly appreciated. Also, thank you if you read through it all."
I‚Äôm always depressed,"Sorry not really a confession but I just feel so sad and needed to get this off my chest.

I‚Äôm only fifteen but since I was eleven I have had depression and anxiety for months at a time then I would feel better and positive for ages, but then it comes back and I feel like shit everyday, I cry so much over anything for hours. I cut my thighs to try and feel better, now I have urges to cut every time I feel super anxious.

I feel extremely anxious when we go to peoples houses just because of the thought of having to talk to them, I never talk to our family friends because I‚Äôm scared of being ridiculed and I just don‚Äôt know what to say, mum thinks I‚Äôm just being shy, and every time we get home from outings I cry in the car and then cry myself to sleep when I get home. I just cry and hug myself in the fetal position while my breathing is really fast and I pull at my hair, I think it‚Äôs anxiety attacks. Now I just isolate myself from any social situation possible, including school, I‚Äôm barely passing because my attendance is so bad, I fake sickness to my mum when I‚Äôm anxious to get off school.

I have only like four friends at school and I would never want to tell any of them about this and none of my teachers either. I feel like I can‚Äôt talk to anyone I feel so alone and worthless. On my birthday a couple days ago I cried all day and slumped around the house because I felt like I wasn‚Äôt worth celebrating and wasting all the money my parents spend on me.

I feel like an asshole and I like I just let everyone down. I don‚Äôt know what to do but I don‚Äôt want to tell anyone because I‚Äôm so embarrassed."
Just some positive comments to those who need it,"To those of you feeling down, just remember that this period is the time to really reflect what you really want out of life. This period is the period that will make you, don't think of this as a negative, actually think of it as a positive, you will thank yourself in the future. You are not alone so don't worry and the right people will come to you, you don't need to worry about anything. "
Has anyone ever had the feeling...,"... right in the middle of your chest, it feels like a light switch has turned off and you suddenly don‚Äôt feel like doing anything?"
to the girls & guys smiling through their depression ‚ù§Ô∏è,"
i know things are hard rn & you feel like you‚Äôll never truly be happy . you feel like your world is falling apart & there‚Äôs nothing you can do but watch . you feel scared , empty & sometimes you feel nothing . you aren‚Äôt okay , but you look like it

you paint on a smile , dress in fine clothes & pretend like you‚Äôre fine . you put your depression aside , so you can maybe put a smile on someone else‚Äôs face . you let people walk all over you & feel sorry for those who hurt you
you bottle everything up , so no one knows how you truly feel . you‚Äôre tired of the way things are & feeling this way . you‚Äôre tired of faking your way through life by pretending to be this strong & happy person . you‚Äôre tired of having to put up so many walls to protect yourself

you may feel put down by others & the things they say , but you don‚Äôt say anything because you don‚Äôt want anyone else to feel the way you do . you want everyone to like you , even when you know it‚Äôs better to just steer away from them

you‚Äôve been hurt before , maybe more than once . you refuse to let anyone in because you fear they won‚Äôt stay . you want to be happy more than anything , but you‚Äôre scared you‚Äôll ruin it . you fear that you‚Äôll run off the only good thing that has ever happened to you
so many people who struggle with depression hesitate to get help because of a stigma . our society has conditioned us to be ashamed of our ‚Äúnegative‚Äù emotions

we‚Äôre reminded of how lucky we are , of how many would feel blessed to be in our shoes , etc . but in reality , that doesn‚Äôt help with depression . is depressed people know our circumstances & i for one often feel guilty for being sad despite everything

let me tell you something . you‚Äôre beautiful . you‚Äôre strong . you‚Äôre better than this . you can & will overcome it , if you believe you can . there are other people just like you , all over the world that are going through this with you . you‚Äôre not alone

there are people in your life that care about you & would do anything they possibly could for you . those people that hurt you aren‚Äôt worth you crying over . you should never let anyone make you feel less important than you are
one day you‚Äôll be happy , look back on this & realize how much time you wasted worrying about people who don‚Äôt even matter . you‚Äôll have people in your life that make you feel so blessed that you may even forget this

stay strong & remember that you‚Äôre all strong , beautiful , amazing individuals who deserve the world & are destined for greatness ‚ù§Ô∏è . God bless you üôèüèº"
I‚Äôm drowning and I don‚Äôt know what to do,"Sometimes I think that maybe I don‚Äôt really know what I want. I hate it. I hate how I look at other people and hate them. I hate when they smile, I hate when they laugh I hate how fucking happy everyone else is. I‚Äôm being left behind. I know I am, everyone is so far ahead of me and I‚Äôm drowning in my own damn mind.

 I can‚Äôt keep this up. I can‚Äôt keep smiling and pretending I‚Äôm cool with being the lonely asshole who stays in her room all day. Who only goes outside to go to class or to get some unhealthy shit that she‚Äôll feel bad about ten minutes later. I don‚Äôt think I want to die. I just... I want to be free. But maybe freedom is death for me. 

I want to hit something. I want to yell and scream but at the same time I just want someone to hug me and tell me that it‚Äôs okay and that I matter. But that won‚Äôt happen. Not in a way that‚Äôs genuine and real, it‚Äôs all fucking pretend to make people feel better and act like they actually care for the small lonely bitch who tries too hard to not care at all. 

If I‚Äôm alone then maybe it‚Äôs better for me to leave anyway, fully embrace it instead of begging for some kind of helping hand. No one would really care if I go. I give them three months tops until I just become a distant name they remember every so often. Everything is so loud but painfully silent at the same time why can‚Äôt it stop I want everything to just fucking stop. 

I tried to get help last year but they just pretended to care about me to. They read straight off a damn script. Didn‚Äôt take long for me to figure out the pattern and say what I needed to get out. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I feel like this my final chance to ask for help before I go back into a hole I may not be able to escape from again. I don‚Äôt trust anyone and those few that I do hole a level of trust for I don‚Äôt want to burden them so I smile and play it off as some edgy joke. I need help but I don‚Äôt even know where to start."
"My self care plan, and I'd appreciate some further advice.","Hello everyone,

I'm a 26 year old woman and I suffer from depression. I'm in therapy and on antidepressants. I attempted suicide in April 2018 but, since then, I've made a lot of progress and I'm quite happy with myself. But loneliness is still a major trigger for my depression. Tomorrow I'll leave for another city because I have to participate in a public competition for a workplace (I'm in Italy so, in order to work for the Government, you have to participate to public selections). 

Problem: I don't know anyone in this city so I'll be alone for seven days. Yes, I'll meet other people who apply for the same selection, but at the end of the day I'll return to my hotel room and I'll be alone. And I'm very scared. 

This is my self care plan, that I organized with my therapist:

\- focusing on the public selection;

\- bringing my favourite books;

\- Netflix for the nights;

\- going to fine restaurants and enjoying good food

\- visiting the city in my spare time 

\- calling my SO and/or friends if I really feel overwhelmed 

Do you have any other advice? I'm a bit anxious. 

Thank you!"
I'm alone.,"I'm lost. I'm afraid. I'm worthless. I have no one in my life anymore, bar one friend who lives on the opposite side of the world. I lost my boyfriend yesterday. He broke up with me because my depression was bringing him down. I understand, I guess, but the last thing I could ever have wanted or needed was my boyfriend to leave me, he was my rock, and he cheered me up even on my worst days.

I have no family. They never wanted much to do with me, especially when I started developing mental health issues 8 years ago. They slowly but surely made their way out of my life and upset me in the most awful ways.

I have no friends. I moved into university and left my friends at home, and I really struggled to make new friends here. I have one, my flatmate, but that's it, no one else wants anything to do with me. I'm even considering moving back home to a mother who really dislikes me and made my life a living hell, I can't stay here at uni. 

I have no one left. I have no reason to live anymore. I've fought for so long, and surprisingly, I think I can say I'm currently at the lowest part of my life, and I have gone through and done a tonne of shit.

I don't know what to do anymore."
Advice to gain energy?,I spend most of my time laying in bed and I can't spend much time out of it without crashing hard afterwards. I want to stop being so useless around the house and actually do stuff instead of laying around. Any advice?
Is it worth trying more anti-depressants?,"Hey everyone,

My depression has been out of control over the last year. It's always been bad, but this was the first year where I woke up nearly every day thinking about suicide. I've been seeing a therapist for more than a decade and over that time I've been talked into anti-depressants several times. And without fail none of them helped. 

Prozac, Solexia, Welbutrin, and another I'm blanking on all had no positive effect and untenable sexual side effects. This past year I tried Effexor and had to quit after a month or so because it made me feel emotionally numb and I felt no fear or concern about my growing desire to end my life. Now I'm very apprehensive about even trying another SSRI/SNRI

As of a few days ago I made one last try at maybe getting the Spravato treatment. But because I live in the world's richest third world country(the U.S.), all of my prior SSRI experiences mean nothing. The insurance company requires that I endure at least 3 immediate attempts with drugs they want to cover before they even consider honoring the insurance that I pay them for.

Has anyone similarly developed this apprehension towards antidepressants and eventually found one that worked? I was given a list of more modern SNRI's and I'm fucking terrified that they'll make me feel like he last one and I'll give in and do it."
I can‚Äôt take this anymore,"I can‚Äôt take this suffering anymore. Everyday feels meaningless and miserable. I don‚Äôt remember who I am, the past few months it feels like I‚Äôve completely lost myself. I look at photos of me and don‚Äôt even feel like it was me. I don‚Äôt feel connected to anyone anymore, including myself. My mind says awful things everyday, and it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt get it to stop. I can‚Äôt think normally anymore. I don‚Äôt laugh or smile like.. EVER anymore. I don‚Äôt find things funny. I‚Äôm sad and lonely. I feel like there‚Äôs no hope in me getting better. Another thing I‚Äôd lik to add is that with all of this I feel like I‚Äôve lost my imagination. I can remember vivid images of things I‚Äôve seen, but coming up with something myself feels impossible. It hasn‚Äôt been like this before, I‚Äôve always been creative and had a great imagination, but now it just feels gone. I feel so hopeless and useless. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I‚Äôm slowly giving up, I cry everyday about how I‚Äôm feeling and the traumas that have happened to me. i can‚Äôt stop thinking about how things could‚Äôve been different if I got help and told someone how was feeling when this all initially started. I need help but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just want to go back in time and do things differently. I feel weak. I feel like smiling or being happy makes/made me weak. Loving anyone or anything made me weak. I don‚Äôt want to think like that though! When I was in love that was the happiest I‚Äôve ever been. So that doesn‚Äôt make me weak.. right?"
26yo Male Just want someone to listen,"I‚Äôm sorry I just need to tell someone my story and what I‚Äôm going through. Right now I feel like I just can‚Äôt keep up the act. Every day I wake up and dread all the things I have to get done, and think of the people I‚Äôm going to have to talk to. All I can think about is how there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any path or course of actions I can take that will lead to any type of long term happiness. All day I fake smiles and tell jokes, but really I‚Äôm just counting down the hours until it‚Äôs over. About 5 years ago I tried hanging myself, but somehow my brother knew and found me and cut me down. I then spent a month in a psych ward and got a therapist etc. We tried a bunch of different medications over the next year but honestly most of them made me feel worse and none really had any noticeably positive effect. I tried CBT and all that but I just couldn‚Äôt buy in. While dealing with all of this no one ever knew, except my family and a few very close friends after I tried to kill myself. After I got out of the hospital I had to live on a friends couch for a while because my parents said ‚Äúwe think you‚Äôll do better if you live on your own‚Äù but really they just didnt want to deal with me anymore. I got a job at minimum wage and worked my way up to manager and got my own place within 6 months, and things were ok for a while. I then ended becoming partners with the owner and opened my own store, and things were ok for a while, but I couldn‚Äôt be sober at night, I‚Äôd have to smoke or drink or my head would go right back to where I was. But over the past few months everything is turning grey again. I have to force myself to shower and to brush my teeth and most days I just can‚Äôt. I can get so much done at work, but I can‚Äôt even do basic things to take care of myself. I feel trapped. I want to end it so badly but now there‚Äôs employees who count on their paychecks and are barely making it as is. I‚Äôve starting cutting and burning myself again which helps numb the pain a little but I just don‚Äôt know if I can go through this again tomorrow. Thanks for listening to my boring story, hope you‚Äôre all doing well"
I'm happy,I made a post awhile ago about my situation and wanna update that I'm dropping out of school going full time and I'll be much more happy
Relapsing into a depressive episode and this article helps validate my experience,"I often feel crazy and start to panic as my depression comes back. My mind then gets influenced by the depression and I start to believe the distortions.

This author of this article seems to share similar experiences with me and her listed steps are quite helpful. Makes me feel a little less alone. I hope this can help you guys too.

I wish life had a reset button,"I feel lost and aimless. I have goals and things I want to do, but my decisions over the last years have pushed me away from the career I now realised I want. Making a change now feels nearly impossible, especially since I'd like to migrate. (Increasing xenophobia across nations, pending drastic resource shortage, yaaaaay)

I am struggling and finding opportunities that get me closer step by step but I can't help but dream of how things could have been had I made better decisions. Even the decisions I'm making now, though they feel right, I'm terrified I'll regret the also. And I'm making a commitment on this, a step that is interdisciplinary between what I've been doing and what I want to do, that I'd hate to break. 

I am losing faith in hard work and efforts. I feel like I'm stuck dealing with the consequences of my mistakes, in choosing the wrong field, forever. Which is probably true."
I got sick of online mental health chat services so I made a better site called MellowTalk. It helps people work out problems by incentivising good listeners,"Hello! My name is Benjamin, I'm a highschooler from Virginia. A little while back I had some serious problems with depression and many times I used the chat service Blahtherapy as a release by helping people on the weekends. However, in the past couple months the chat quality has dropped severely and I find the site is often overrun with bots or trolls. It really seems like they are putting all their effort into the online therapist portion of their site and leaving the far more popular chat aspect as an afterthought.

After a couple weeks of this I decided I could do better myself so I made the site [MellowTalk](https://mellowtalk.com) to replace the platform. My site is also for the purpose of mental health and is free with no ads, forever. It pairs listeners and talkers in one-on-one conversations with the talkers being given the ability to give the listeners points if they feel like they are doing a good job, making them ascend up a leaderboard. All names are silly and randomly generated and refresh at the beginning of every chat making things totally anonymous and safe. Inbound and outbound connections are also heavily encrypted so I promise there is complete and total privacy. I designed the site based on what I wanted and I only hope that other people might want it too. I didn't have anyone to talk to and I don't want anyone else to have that experience.

It's a very small site right now. Very, very small. And totally community funded, so not exactly profitable. That said, if it seems interesting please check it out because I think it has some good vibes going. I'd love some feedback and for questions or concerns, leave a comment or send me a PM and I'll definitely get back to you. Thanks for listening, take care.

I hope this can be posted here, I want to be clear that my goal is not solicitation."

Has anybody ever felt like that?,"Hi everyone,

I don't know if this is the right sub for this and if not, i'm deeply  sorry because i know there are people here who are in pain and need your help more than i do.

Let's tell you a bit about me for the matter at hands: for as long as i can remember, i've been a books guy, when other kids would go play together during school breaks i would just go sit somewhere and read. My father is a history fan, especially WW2 and i grew up hearing stories about soldiers, visiting museums in normandy and watching war movies.

Today i'm 23, married, two dogs and i just finished a series of intensive web developpment courses. The next step is finding an internship and getting a job as webdev.

But...

I feel like everything's pointless, i spent my life reading about people doing things that matters and now im supposed to just get a job so i can spend hours doing something that i don't like that much (still the professionnal activity i like the most of all the ones i tried so far) just so i can make it to the next month? Is that really all there is to life?Am I to just waste my entire time working and try not to get bored the rest of the time?

So i guess what i'm asking is: has anybody here found the answer to that question?

PS: sorry if that doesn't make sense, i can only put words on it when i'm drunk so it doesn't always make sense."
Going through hell atm,"I am the worst I have ever been in a long time. My cat has been missing for almost 5 weeks and I feel dead inside. I dont know where he is, if he is alive. He was my best friend. on top of that I am already depressed. I don't even have enough energy to cry anymore.

I have cleaned my room, done a rerun of my favourite tv show, and I don't start school for a fortnight... my next psych appointment isn't for another 3 weeks.. and I don't have any friends to comfort me.

I feel like I am suffocating in despair, I don't want to be conscious. I have spent the whole of June sad and right now I'm so stressed I feel nauseated and panicky.

No idea how to calm down or numb the pain. :(
What in gods name can I do to feel okay, I am on the verge of a breakdown."
I‚Äôm having a really hard time,"I‚Äôm really struggling maintaining my will to live. I‚Äôm tired of everything. And don‚Äôt want do go through everything to come. 

I recently went through some therapy through my college. My assigned therapist was a practicum student and last week was our last session together after this entire semester. I feel very empty now.

My mom lost her brother to suicide and my best friend lost another one of her good friends the same way. Seeing first hand the way it affected them keeps me going but that feeling is diminishing. 

I‚Äôm just so tired of everything and I have no motivation or energy to do the simplest of tasks. When I think of my future it seems like such a long road ahead of me and I don‚Äôt want to do it. I‚Äôm really struggling. 

I can sometimes see a future for myself and my career but at the same time that dream seems so fantasized and that I‚Äôll never make it"
This is my 100%,"This is my 100%. If you don‚Äôt like it leave. This is all that I can give. Appreciate me for what I have to offer and don‚Äôt expect more of someone who is drowning inside their own brain. I refuse to be the girl who caters to a mans every need. Appreciate me for what I have to offer. Appreciate my brain. Value my compassion. This is who i am and this is everything I have to give. If you want more you can find it elsewhere. Someday, someone will want me. They will appreciate me for the person that I have become and love me for my strength and flare. But right now- this is all I have. If it isn‚Äôt enough then walk away."
Depression Ruining Concentration,"I am a college student, and I am really struggling with depression and anxiety. Recently, I have noticed that it's become very difficult for me to concentrate during my classes and while trying to do my homework. I just don't have any sort of attention span anymore. I'm lucky if I can pay attention and take notes through half of an hour long lecture. I know that lack of concentration can be a symptom of depression, but I haven't brought it up to my therapist because I don't know if it's because of my depression or just because I'm not trying hard enough to pay attention. Am I just using my depression as an excuse to not pay attention in class? "
Being alive is so weird.,"About 2 days ago I felt like killing myself and it's all I could think about. But I didn't know what to do, I worked on my appearance in the meantime. Complaining the whole time in my mind that I'm not pretty and it doesn't matter what I do I'll never look good enough. I made my hair so soft and silky and straight and it still made me sad. Then I continued and did my makeup something I haven't done in years and still I felt stupid. After all that I was still alive and went to work and had a good day. I still dont really know what I want but somehow just doing my hair and makeup was enough of a distraction to keep me alive. I hate this but I guess it's okay. I still feel kind of hopeless and lost it's kind of crazy how we can find distractions from ourselves. "
I hate Facebook.,"It makes me feel like crap. Every photo of parties that I am left out of is a like a sucker punch to the stomach. Even though I know if I were invited, I would probably have to decline because of kids anyway. 
But it would be nice to know at least I mattered enough to be invited. Guess all these people are not my friends after all. And that just makes me feel even worse. That I have no real friends.

Fuck you, Facebook."
Depression is a bitch,I just need someone to talk to that will help me get through this feeling I've been feeling.
"I want to learn to appreciate the positive gay inclusion and acceptance, and stop letting homophobia and gay exclusion and alienation burden me","I am a feminine gay guy. So, not only am I guy, but I like being feminine too in my appearance and behavior. And especially online, I keep on and on and on coming across SO many people against homosexuality, and/or people against men being allowed to be feminine.

&#x200B;

And what I have been using since I was a kid to try to help make me feel better is feel-good escapism in the forms of movies and shows. But as an adult, I can't even use that, since the type of movies and shows I'm interested in keeps excluding homosexuals and feminine guys. And even when they don't, the representation is poorly handled.

&#x200B;

I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character I've seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtube-exclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesn't exist within these genres.

&#x200B;

But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers: Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose.

&#x200B;

And furthermore, people ARE getting more gay-supportive, and more people are encouraging gay inclusion. So rationally, I should know better. But I keep feeling so sad and depressed and tired of life, feeling like there is no escapism properly working for me whenever I feel down. And I just don't know how to deal with it."
I feel anxious about going back to college,"Winter break just ended and I have to go back today. I‚Äôve been feeling down the whole last semester. I have one last semester left before I graduate. I feel empty inside and I feel like I haven‚Äôt done much fun stuff with college. 

I‚Äôm 22 and still a virgin/never been in a relationship (although I have been kissed but that was at a parties/clubs by strangers, and very rarely, so meaningless), and it‚Äôs eating me up, because I feel like no one wants me. The few girls who I got ‚Äúclose‚Äù with (and by close I mean talking) turned me down, and last semester I got friendzoned by the girl I liked. I have no clues how to date or how to initiate intimacy. All of my friends have had sex/dated and I feel so left out. I‚Äôve lied to people about my lack of success just so I don‚Äôt get mocked.

I‚Äôve been underweight most of my life too and no matter how hard I try I can‚Äôt seem to put on weight or bulk up. I‚Äôve never been athletic and don‚Äôt have anything to show for that. I‚Äôm also not an interesting person, or had any interesting life experiences. I don‚Äôt have enough money to travel, and don‚Äôt really have any unique hobbies or skills. When I was in high school my parents were very strict and never let me go out, which I feel has socially stunted me. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll get a job after graduation (despite being in a decent field) and when I return home i feel like I‚Äôll be stuck at there NEETing and working minimum wage jobs. Two of my closest friends have got jobs laid out after gradation.

I know when I graduate I‚Äôll be miserable."
How to coexist with depressed people (by someone with chronic depression),"Maybe a throwaway? I don't know. I'm depressed (have been managing it with increasing success over the last 10 years) and this post was inspired by this recent post in the sub: [https://old.reddit.com/r/depression\_help/comments/eeu8d4/nobody\_likes\_you\_when\_youre\_depressed/](https://old.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/eeu8d4/nobody_likes_you_when_youre_depressed/). Please feel free to add your own suggestions, these are the ones that came to mind for me. 

1. Don't tell us what we're capable of doing or have the potential to do. We're already doing our best. 
2. Providing love and support for us where we're at is the secret to getting us to function better, but sometimes even support doesn't counteract a really hard day. Be okay with this. 
3. Stop giving us advice on how to become less depressed unless we ask for it specifically. See #2. 
4. Before you say that we are perpetuating our own bad situations, remember that you are missing several factors that create a person with depression: environment, income, home life, schooling, abuse factors, etc. 
5. If you are involved in a power dynamic-oriented relationship with us (parents, bosses, etc.), you are the last person that should be pushing boundaries or forcing us to ""go outside"". But you are the first person who should be ensuring that you aren't pushing us too hard. 
6. People who don't want to take pills are not making excuses. Concerns about SSRIs are not unfounded, and it's up to us to weigh the risks and benefits with their doctor/psychiatrist. 
7. We're not always sad. Sometimes we're angry. Sometimes we're numb. Sometimes we seem completely cheerful and normal and hide all of our symptoms as best we can. 
8. Sometimes we *do* make it much worse with our own downward spirals and negative inner-talk. Telling us this does nothing to solve that problem. Refer to #2. 
9. Therapists - get extra rest. Take care of yourself. Do not take on too many patients. Be sure that this is what you really want to do, because people are counting on you to truly care. Be careful how you talk about people's mental health situations, because your compassion fatigue can and will rear its ugly head. 
10. If you're sick of us whining about our problems, it means you need a break from whatever is stressing you out and shouldn't be trying to support anyone's depression. Take a vacation. Go on a date. Focus on yourself. 
11. If you're close to us, ask if you can do specific things to help (if you want to). Offer to make food, clean up, or run errands on a bad day. Maybe all we need is someone to sit next to or a hug. Maybe we need some time alone. Maybe we finally need a ride to a counselor's office or hospital. Ask. 
12. Don't support us in the hopes that your efforts will ""fix"" our depression. It's something you have to be willing to accept without expectations of anything changing. We may beat depression, but some of us take longer or will continue to struggle with it our whole lives - if this makes you uncomfortable, that sounds like a you problem."
"A note, from me to me","  

Apologies in advance for how long this is. I‚Äôm not honestly not even entirely sure why I wanted to post this here. I suppose I need to say this somewhere that seems a bit more real than just my brain. Somewhere I can actually hear myself say it rather than just let it go on loop in my head, until all the words lose their meaning and the whole thing ends up drifting away from me like an empty boat aimed at some dark shadowy place out of sight. I‚Äôm just afraid that if I don‚Äôt really try to say this properly, then it‚Äôll go to that place and this moment will be just one more thing I let float away from me. And I suppose this whole post will probably be as self-absorbed and over-described and rehashed as I‚Äôm worried it will sound. Probably even more than that. But I couldn‚Äôt give a shit anymore, because more than afraid of what I‚Äôm going to sound like, and how I‚Äôm coming across, and what people might think of me, more than any of that, I‚Äôm just tired. And I‚Äôm sad. And I want to get off this ride I‚Äôve been taking myself on for way too long. And I know that probably sounds like a pretty ominous start to a post on a subreddit filled with some pretty ominous posts, but don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not going to be like that. This ain‚Äôt gonna end with someone needing to call an ambulance. Not fucking today. 

But first, an intro.

If you ask me on any other day, I‚Äôll say I see myself as a basically lump of a person. As a meat sack. I imagine myself sometimes as like a piece of soft and sagging flesh, like the human equivalent of that part under the arm that jiggles when you move. And my greatest fear is that I‚Äôm going to sit on this couch and waste until I eventually kill myself, or until the world moves on and I‚Äôm left sort of stuck here in my own pocket of time. And then I kill myself. And honestly, a lot of the time suicide seems like the best non-solution I‚Äôve got. It‚Äôs the one I understand the most. Because where suicide is a small and easy full stop, the other option is something really long and complex and so impossible to understand from where I‚Äôm standing that it starts to looks as if there‚Äôs just no way it‚Äôs possible. That it‚Äôs basically beyond me. And this is where it gets really tricky, and this is the part that I need to say to myself. 

But, before I do. I need to stress that this is not at all meant as a comment on anyone else here. Y‚Äôall keep doing what you need to do to keep those chins right up high, and don‚Äôt let anyone tell you that you aren‚Äôt doing otherwise. Because I‚Äôm certain everyone here is doing absolutely everything they know how to do to be and get better. So don‚Äôt let this little rant of mine feel like another voice of criticism, this is really just a conversation between me and me, one that‚Äôs been a long time coming. But anyway. Back to rant.

From what I can see of myself, the real guilt and shame of it all is that there are definitely things I could be doing. Tricky, complex things sure, but still small and manageable things I can do every day that I‚Äôm simply not doing. That what feels to me like barely managing to stay afloat is actually surrendering one inch at a time. That what I‚Äôm really doing is buying into the depression paradox that I can‚Äôt unfuck myself because I‚Äôm already so fucked up that it‚Äôs going to be impossible to even try to fix it. That I can‚Äôt fix my own problems because I‚Äôm going to fold when it gets tough. And then, when I do fold, I‚Äôm going to cry and hate and blame myself for folding and then use the whole cry/hate/self-blame experience as fuel to beat myself up so bad that I can feel like justice has been served for giving up. That I‚Äôll punish myself on behalf of the depression so it can trick me into feeling justified to say ‚ÄúStop! Please! I‚Äôm already in so much pain, why are you making me do even one thing more.‚Äù A sort of you-can‚Äôt-hate-me-if-I-hate-myself-more strategy. And therefore I win. Or the depression wins I guess. It wins by having me prove to myself that I‚Äôm useless and feckless and that clearly the whole thing is not my fault because when I try to fix myself, I end up being in so pain that I have to stop, and so clearly the whole thing is because of some inherent quality I‚Äôve got. That I‚Äôm fundamentally weak. And therefore, that there‚Äôs no point even trying.

And this is where the truly evil part occurs, the real grotesque sharp-toothed evil-eyed element of this whole thing, because then I get to believe it. Because I want to believe it. Because then I get to vindicate myself. I am no longer pathetic, a wastrel, not doing enough to help myself and unable to do anything. Instead, I‚Äôm damaged. Deformed in some way that‚Äôs just too hard to pull apart. Which is bullshit because I know this is just what the shitty black tarred side of my brain wants me to believe. I know what it wants more than anything else is for me to buy so deeply into its power over me that I start believing it is me. That I start doing its job for it. And I‚Äôm so fucking done with it. I am seriously **so** fucking done with it. Let me just say that again.

I.

Am.

So.

Fucking.

Done.

With.

It.

I‚Äôm done with this pathetic vagrant type of life I‚Äôve been letting myself live, this habit of settling into something and then immediately looking for an exit strategy because I certain it‚Äôs not gonna work. I‚Äôm done with dipping a toe in and letting the depression convince me that it‚Äôs too cold, or it‚Äôs not the right colour of blue, or that it‚Äôs just not the right time of the year to start trying to fucking fix myself. I‚Äôm done with doing the depression‚Äôs job for it. And so this is it. This is my promise to myself. I am going to make the depression fucking work for it. And if it wants to kill me, it‚Äôs going to have to kill itself first trying to figure out how to do it. I am not its fucking slave. And here are some other things I‚Äôm going to do.

I‚Äôm gonna keep going to therapy, even if some days it feels like it‚Äôs not doing a fucking thing. I‚Äôm gonna keep going. 

I‚Äôm gonna stop letting the depression tell me that I‚Äôm fundamentally damaged. It‚Äôs not true. There are, for sure, a lot of things I need to work out, and I‚Äôll do it one step at a time, but I am not incapable of taking those steps.

I‚Äôm gonna stop beating myself up when I go for one of those steps and miss. I am not going to punish myself for missing. Not only is that not fair, or even realistic to believe as being possible, but it‚Äôs just plain unhelpful in trying to get back up again.

Here are some other things I‚Äôm going to do.

I‚Äôm gonna mediate more. I‚Äôm gonna exercise more. I‚Äôm gonna attend to my thoughts more honestly. And, more than anything, I am going to learn how to live for the sake of fucking living and not for the sake of just surviving.

That‚Äôs it. Rant over. I‚Äôm going to put on some shoes and then go have a smoke outside and try to see if there are any stars out tonight. Then I‚Äôm going to go to sleep and wake up and try as hard as I can to remember how I feel right now."

Help with bf and low sex drive,"I take several medications for depression and anxiety and they have a serious effect on my sex drive.  There are times when it's practically nonexistent, and times when it seems normal.  My problem is my bf.  We've been together almost three years and I've never been happier.

He is amazing.  He's sexy, smart, funny and so sweet and caring.  I love him so much, but I worry.  His sex drive is so much higher than mine and I'm scared that I'm going to lose him.  

He's not the kind of guy who would ever cheat, that's not my worry.  What I worry about is him getting frustrated in the bedroom because of my low sex drive. 

 I guess what im asking is, are there other ppl out there who have this issue?  How did you resolve it?  I enjoy sex, especially with him, I just, I don't know how to approach this.

Edit/update

Had a very long talk with my bf as many of you suggested.  He was super sweet, and supportive, I was in tears of course.  He promises me that he feels like we are fine, and my sex drive isn't an issue for him.  He also said that if I ever felt pressured he was sorry.  So I guess all my worries were for nothing.  

Thank you so much to those who were supportive and offered real advice.  "
Immediate downward spiral,"I've really hit a low spot lately. It feels like everything is going wrong at the same time on purpose. 

I lost my job because of covid and as a result, my apartment. l've moved in with my brother, but it feels like I'm nothing but a burden because I can't find a job and have no money

I have less than 100$ to my name

My car, which in some places, is literally held together with tape, continues to fall apart faster than I can fix it.

I've struggled with depression and extreme self hatred for as long as I can remember. When I was a teenager I started self medicating with weed to help me deal with things like my depression and anxiety, which helps a lot actually. But because I have no money, I can't afford to anymore. 

Things were going fine until covid hit, and then life immediately failed. Like everything shut down all at once. I don't know where to go, I don't know what to do, other than slog through the listings on my brother's computer, trying to find a job."
Today is my birthday.,"Today is my 16th birthday. I am all alone, i have no one to spend it with. No one even remember my birthday, no one said it either. I have been contemplating suicide and jave been looking forward to today in hopes that something would change. But nothing did. And if on mt special day nothing changes, then will anything ever really change? I decided no, and I have not made my final decision on whether or not i should follow through with whats been on my mind. I am posting this in the hopes that maybe someone will care. In the hopes that maybe someone will try to stop me, but I dont think that's what will happen. No body seems to really care about me these days. I'm just another guy on the street to everyone. This will probably get buried but oh well..

I have posted this on another subreddit. So if you see this twice that is why.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the birthday wishes!!!! I cant respond to all of you but it really has made me realize that there are grest people in thjs world.

Edit 2: im mot exaggerating when i say this, but the people in this comment section have saved my life and helped me against making a decision that I have come to realize I would regret. This is the nicest most kind group of people I have ever met, each and every one of you guys are so kind amd caring and have helped me realize that this doesnt have to be the end! Thank you all so much!!!!"
If I died I feel like no one would notice (14m),"Idk where to start, I've always been quiet, that's just the way I am, but around the age of 11 my parents fought for custody, it didnt feel like they were fighting for me, they were fighting for my brothers, my parents never show they care for me, they're always focused on my brothers, and no one appreciates me, no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, no one notices me

I've always had a hard time making friends, but I moved right as quarantine started, I didnt know anyone, I was alone, I lost connection with my friends, except my for my long distance girlfriend, I gave her everything I ever had, all my money, my time, my energy, there wasnt a time where I wasn't there for her, I suppose I got too attached, but, I still made sure she was happy, I helped her with her anxiety/depression, I spent months convincing her parents to get her a therapist, helped her with every problem she had, big and small, got her presents, gave her confidence, and then with the long distance our relationship got rocky, with the isolation with only her to talk to, I got depressed, I talked to her, but she never cared, she never tried to make me fell better, she only cared how she felt, so I was confused how I felt, we went on and off from texting, and then one day her bff texted me how I was toxic, I probably was but didnt see it, but, it still hurt to hear that it was my fault, i only wanted her to be happy and all I got in return was a punch in the face, me and her dated for half a year and I knew her for 3, she was my everything, I didn't have a lot of friends so I gave her all my time, she put herself in front of me, and that what everyone else does, expects me to give them attention, all my life it has been like that, all I am to people is a outlet, if I killed myself no one would care. They would forget in a month, I just wish someone cared for me for onc

I need my confidence back, I need my happiness back, I dont even know who I am, I want help


Edit: Thank you all for the reassurance, this is a lot of support and I honestly cant thank all of you enough, I've taken some advice and I'll try to better myself with it, I will try to talk to my parents about it, again, thank you all for endless kindness, it means more than you would think üëç"
I mentioned before that I had suicidal thought to my husband and he regrets marrying me because of it. He said he loves me but he didn't ask for this.,"How do I even react to this? I have no idea how to feel because I would regret marrying me, too."
Seeking advice for working with depressed partner," Hi all,

I've been dating a really wonderful woman (mid 20's) for about half of a year that has been depressed for the last couple of months.

At first she was mostly quiet, tired, and sad, but she was responsive enough to tell me she couldn't hang out because she wasn't feeling great. I understood that she was isolating herself, so I gave her space and tried to be understanding. We still saw each other once or twice a week, but we communicated a lot less.

Now she's becoming more irritable, less responsive, and frankly not very nice to me. I've been taking the mean comments/criticism in stride and talking with her as if what she said wasn't mean. But it's beginning to take a toll on me. She's also shut down affection/intimacy for the last month which has made me feel less close to her (but I understand that can disappear). She also asked for more space this past weekend (which was an easy thing to say okay to, being that we're not even seeing other very much right now).

I think I need to have a boundaries conversation with her so that I can outline that I need her to try to be less critical of me, to talk to me about what I'm doing that isn't working / what she would rather I be doing, and to talk to me about why affection has died between us and what we could do instead to maintain closeness in our relationship.

Could somebody give me feedback on if having a boundaries conversation with her would be a good / bad idea?

Thank you!"
Will i ever be enough for someone?,"Hello my fellow redditors

I'm new to this sub and I've recently had my heart broken by someone who i thought was the one, but at least she was civil enough to tell me now instead of 3 years down the line.

A bit about me; 

I'm a 23 year old male father of one and  i suffer quite badly with depression and anxiety, prior to these events I've been feeling lost and the occasional thought of suicide or self harm wasn't out of the ordinary, i struggle as it is on a day to day basis I'm currently under the mental health team here in the UK.

I'm reaching out for help from anyone who will listen, this is my last cry for help."
Why do I keep losing friends?,I‚Äôm convinced everyone hates me I‚Äôm so worthless and stupid and ugly and undesirable all I do is complain and be sad and hurt but even the people who ‚Äúcare‚Äù about me just leave me it doesn‚Äôt matter who no matter how sweet I just scare them off idk why but they just block me and ignore me and even some make fun of me I just want a friend I just want to feel wanted
"I have let myself go, how can I get myself back?","Update: I brushed my teeth this morning. I am incredibly touched...like, actually crying (nothing new there!) by those who took the time to respond and offer suggestions and words of encouragement. I also saw some of you who could relate, please feel free to message me at any time...I always feel better when I see there are other people who feel the way I do because depression can be so isolating. Here's to all of you, and me brushing my teeth again tomorrow <3  

Throughout my youth I was always considered ""pretty"", I had a lot of friends and an active dating life. Then, about 5 years ago-I had a major depressive episode, this lead to medication changes, which led to weight gain. In the past 5 years, I've gained 100 lbs. I can't remember the person I used to be, she seems so far away. It's almost like I've lived two lives, the then and the now. Sometimes I sleep in so late, I end up leaving the house without brushing my hair or my teeth. I know what I need to do and what I should do to fix this all, but everything just seems so far out of reach. I guess I will begin by brushing my teeth tomorrow before I leave my apartment...."
My grandmother is starving herself to death.,"My grandmother (90F) is starving herself to death. She definitely has depression, which I have also (I suspect I got it from her...). Her sister starved herself to death five years ago. 

She weighs about 60 lb at this point. Her husband tries to get her to eat but she refuses to eat more than a few bites. She threatens to slit her wrists and has been threatening it for 30 years. 

What can I do? This is weighing on me so much. I can‚Äôt stand seeing her waste away. I feel like she has so little time left."
"If you tend to feel fatigued, depressed or in pain, try boosting your Vitamin D levels","According to a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310306) from several years ago, 41.6% of adults in the United States are Vitamin D **deficient**, which means high likelihood of feeling fatigued, in pain, and depressed. Especially if you live in areas with low levels of sunlight, or work in a corporate environment, your Vitamin D deficiency could be contributing to depression. 

If you're unable to find time to go outside and get natural Vitamin D, try taking 1000 IU of Vitamin D supplements each day. I noticed a radical change in my mood when I did. Hope this helps. "
How to be productive when depressed?,"I simply don‚Äôt care enough about life, no drive no passion etc.  So how do I find the will to do stuff? It feels like there‚Äôs a barrier between me and productivity. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it but I feel terrible as soon as I put in effort in anything"
I don‚Äôt know who I am,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever known. I realized that my personality is just a collection of traits that I‚Äôve absorbed from people in my life. Idk maybe that‚Äôs standard. 
I don‚Äôt have any hobbies, or talents. I don‚Äôt know what to do with my life. 
All my past relationships I realized I was just being used as a placeholder until they found the better choice. I was never someone‚Äôs favorite person. I‚Äôm easily taken advantage of‚ÄîI‚Äôm too nice. 
I‚Äôm lost. I guess I feel empty and hopeless. I feel like I have no purpose. I feel like a waste of life, like a disappointment. Compliments don‚Äôt effect me, and I never believe them. I don‚Äôt feel real emotions anymore; I‚Äôve gotten damn good at faking them. I‚Äôve felt like this for too long. I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore, I want to end it all. The only reason I haven‚Äôt done anything bad is because I guess I have family that loves me. I don‚Äôt know why they do though. I don‚Äôt trust doctors at all so the thought of going to therapy is scary. 
Sorry. I guess I just needed a place to rant. It‚Äôs late. I can‚Äôt sleep but I wish I could, and never wake up. "
Lost my job and my gf broke with me,"I'm destroyed. A couple days ago i lost my job because covid and a few hours ago my gf broke up with me, because she says that she doesnt love me like before since a time and now she realized it.

I don't know what to do, i suffered depression before and i know that if i fall again i'll won't stand up again"
I'm at my end point.,"I feel so alone and like no one cares about me, I have no one to turn to for reassurance or comfort in these very difficult times. Other people have friends and family but I have no one. Suicide phone lines don't help me one bit and besides, I've called too much at this point and I consider myself a nuisance to them. I've attempted to make friends but I always ruin it or they're not interested and ghost me, let me tell you, being thosed or ignored is one of the worst feelings when you're lonely and trying to reach out for that human connection. I don't know what's wrong with my generation or society as a whole, it seems empathy has gone out of fashion with my generation or it went extinct."

"Hey, i just joined reddit and wanted to share something i just wrote. Maybe someone likes it.","It‚Äôs a party. I haven‚Äôt talked to anyone yet. My boyfriend asks me if I don‚Äôt want to say hi to some people we know. I tell him to wait until I have my third glass down. Three is my lucky number when drinking (that‚Äôs how many glasses it takes to make me go from totally social awkward to social butterfly). After that, I even go to the toilet with a girl I know.

As I am waiting for her, a glass in each hand, a girl I saw some times in school walks up to me. ‚ÄúHey girl, I haven‚Äôt seen you for so long! How are you? Haven‚Äôt you been to school lately? Must have been some months since I last saw you. Is it true you‚Äôre dating Dave?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know her name, but thanks to the drink in my hand, it doesn‚Äôt matter. ‚ÄúYes, we have been dating for some months now. You look mesmerizing tonight!‚Äù

I go out to meet my boyfriend again. Some time later the same girl, which now has a name, Anna, sits next to us and starts a conversation. I slowly open up, of course because of the alcohol, but she really seems to want to be friends. So, we hang out all night. We exchange numbers, talk for hours, dance and even ‚Äòdrunk-girl-friend‚Äô kissed sometimes.

I get tired, we walk home. I couldn‚Äôt say bye to her. In the morning, I write her ‚ÄúI hope you arrived home safe‚Äù

She says ‚ÄúYes‚Äù

I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really happy for that‚Äù

She never answers.

My boyfriend always asks why I can‚Äôt talk to people and why I don‚Äôt even try anymore. I used to not really understand that myself, but now I do. The more you open up to people, the more it hurts when they don‚Äôt open up to you. The more you care about others, the more it hurts when they don‚Äôt care about you. I know it shouldn‚Äôt make me so sad that I girl I hung around with once doesn‚Äôt care about me, but I can‚Äôt not care about people I like. And it seems I like pretty much anyone."
"I lost my will to live a long time ago, I've done my best to get through it doesn't get better.","I only felt like living when I was with my ex. Everything had meaning, it seemed like there was a purpose to life since we were together,  and if there wasn't well I felt content we had each other.  Since he left 2 years ago now,  I've tried to move on,  act like I can do it on my own,  my heart isn't in this life anymore,  everything is dull and boring knowing he is gone.  I've also cried and cried and felt the pain my heart feels, I live with a heavy heart everyday. I can't stop loving him,  missing him,  wanting to be with him.  I look back and remember when I felt I had found that something that was always missing,  and now it's gone,  I've lost that spark.  I really don't think I'll ever truly get it back.  I think I will forever just remember those years as if they were some fantasy,  and now I live in the harsh reality of human existence and have been and will. The truth is I have lost all faith in all the things people tell you like time will heal it,  stay busy,  do things you love,  feel the pain and let it out,  I've done it all,  and still have a heavy heart that wants nothing more than to be with him.  I will continue to live life but nothing can help me,  this is just the way it is for me now."
Couldn't Get Out of Bed For Christmas,I should start by saying I am lucky enough to have people to spend the holidays with; for those who didn't I am sorry. I don't understand what's happened to me. I have never been a confident or particularly happy person but this is the first time in my life I can honestly say I hate myself. I opted to stay home yesterday rather than spend the holiday with my family at my sister's house for much the same reason I opt not to do most things: I feel as though my presence there will dampen their good time or they won't have as good a time because they're worried about the weird sad guy in the corner. This morning I woke up to a pitted guilt in my stomach for being so selfish. This series of events or some version of them seem to be cyclical and occurring more and more frequently.  I don't know what to do....
"I couldn‚Äôt physically describe what my depression made me feel to those who didn‚Äôt understand, so I made a short film about it.","Hi everyone,

My name is Nick Casaletto and I‚Äôve been struggling with depression and anxiety for around 12 years now. I‚Äôve seen therapist, been on countless medication and have the support system of an amazing wife. But, my depression would always creep up unexpectedly, as I‚Äôm sure a lot of you can relate, it‚Äôs not exactly fun. 

My only outlet has been movies. Since around the time I started to notice my depression at around 18 years old, I found myself sitting in my bedroom and finding solace in cinema. It was the only place I would feel comfortable being myself, my only escape from the world. 

After all of this time, my depression has matured with me. What started out as something I dealt with by countlessly drinking until I was black out drunk, to my now current quiet depression. The kind that makes you stuck in your thoughts that‚Äôs on a constant loop. I thought, (loving movies and having become accustomed to the craft of editing) why not make my voice heard. Not as a cry for help, but for others who feel like me, and can relate to the visual medium. 

Please note: the short movie is to a song that really inspired me, I was blessed enough to have the licensing and support from the band. 

I hope some of you will watch and relate.

Can you guys help someone out on this post?,"Hey everyone I don‚Äôt really know if this is exactly how this subreddit operates, but I found a post of someone struggling with depression by happenstance, and it barely got any attention.

"Drunk and sad, wrote a paragraph and was wondering how many feel the same.","Warning: drunk so the writing may not be too coherent.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is certainly hard to accept ones flaw, especially because most of the times that single flaw ends up at the center of it all and you start using it as an excuse for everything else.  
Why you can't do this and why you can't do that.  
Everything ends up being caused by that one thing, to the point where you think about how life could be were it not for \*this\*.

You would obviously be more successful, lead a better life and be more social,

but would you?  
How much do you let your own faults dictate what you can and can't do in life.  
How much time have you lost just sulking in your own sadness instead of trying to do something.

Of course I am a hypocrite too, writing about this is extremely easy while actually taking action for yourself, well, that's a whole other story.  
I never did manage to do it (take action, that is) yet advising others with the knowledge of my own struggles seems so easy.  
The answer is right there, in plain sight, with nothing stopping you from reaching it. But then you do try to reach it you suddenly understand how hard it actually is.  
Sometimes I wonder, if I do take that leap, if I do reach the solution, would it be so simple? No, it isn't something that clicks and suddenly your whole life gets better, that would be too easy. Instead it's something extremely hard, that you have to keep up for the rest of your life; and the only thing going for it, it's that every day it becomes a little bit easier.  
Maybe you did try it, you did try to get better but you relapsed into the old habits and the old sulking, then you also understand how easy it is to lose all the progress you tried to make.  
So there you are, or even, there I am; in what seems like a bottomless pit of sadness that you can never reach out of, but can always fall deeper in.  
What are you doing there? Waiting and hoping for something to change? Attempting suicide? Or maybe, like me, you just ask yourself why you can't seem to free yourself from it, why does everyone else look like they managed it while you can't. Is it just easier for other people? Did they have to struggle less than you? Or are you not good enough, are you not strong enough to do it. But why? Why would you not be good enough? Afterall you were born like that, were you not? Oh, maybe that's too easy; blaming it on how you were born, putting the blame off from your shoulders. No, that doesn't seem right, you should have to bear all that weight, after all you deserve it don't you?  
So you are here, after all the thoughts you've had, still in the same pit.  
Living life one day after the other, but without any lasting joy, just going on with your life in autopilot mode, trying to sleep as much as possible to avoid living, while not having the courage, or perhaps selfishness, to end it.

"Months, maybe years without my SO","Hello everyone, I am currently feeling not like myself (as a lot of people in this situation do) but i wanted to ask you for help. I am not in my right state of mind right now, and understanding or coping with informations is very poor. I would like to hear your opinion on this, thank you... Due to the Covid-19 outbreak in europe, almost every country now closed borders, including mine. I understand this precautions and their nesessity but I am still very anxious and sad that i won't see my boyfriend for some time... He lives in country right next to mine. It doesn't seem like our cases of covid-19 are severe like in other states, but I heard someting about borders being closed for couple months or years in our country depending on others states. It makes me very confused and anxious. Does it mean we will have to wait for more countries to open borders? That thought makes my already bad mental health worsen."
I wanted to thank you guys!,"A few days ago, some of you may remember I posted about thinking I was going into the void of depression and was suicidal. Well, I wanted to say I'm feeling a little better. 

A couple of days before I posted I'd suffered a severe head injury. What I didn't know at the time was that severe depression can be caused or complicated by a concussion. Part of my sudden depth of feeling was down to the concussion, which was making me teary and have a breakdown at work. 

Well my boss sat with me and telling me I wasn't worthless until my mum picked me up and was able to get me a doctors appointment where they explained that whilst not causing the depression the sudden urge to self harm etc might be caused by the temporary instability. So I'm booked in to get some help with the underlying depression in the next couple of weeks. In the mean time i'm trying what I can to feel okay, exercising and finding things to be thankful for. 

So thanks for suggesting things to help, and thanks for being here for people!"
This day sucks,"I don't know, maybe I'm being pathetic. But things do get to me.

It started the moment I woke up. I go on twitter and see this horrible news that one of the famous basketball icons, Kobe Bryant was gone. What shattered my heart was that his daughter had died with him. I never really liked basketball that much but I was shocked when tears started to roll down my face.

I slept at 4AM and woke up at around 8:30AM to get ready for school. I had exams today and I guess I tried my best to be prepared for it. 

When I took the exam, the two proctors were whispering to one another. I found out later on that they were gossiping about how they thought my classmate's boyfriend was ugly, which had ticked me off btw, they were both fresh graduates and were waiting to pass the teachers licensing exam, so I found that despicable. Anyway, it really annoyed me and I found myself shushing them, because I couldn't focus. Then the proctor just smiled at me and sarcastically said ""If I'm making too much noise for you, then please leave the classroom so you can take the exam in peace."" It irritated me to my core, so I said ""fuck it"" and wrote whatever the fuck I want on that piece of paper.

In the afternoon, I kinda skipped class with my best friend to grab milkteas. I had just found out that she has this heart disease and it's keeping me on edge; so I want to spend as much time with her as possible before her operation.

We just got back and headed to the library. I remembered I had forgotten to bring ""professional"" clothes for our film. So I told my other ""best friend"" that I had forgotten it. But she cut me off before finishing my sentence by yelling ""shut up a second"". That had really ticked me off. After that, I remained quiet, scrolling on my phone.

After that, the girl that had cut me off half sentence said ""hey, did you guys remember to bring clothes today"" and I answered ""I tried to tell you but you cu-"" ""why the fuck would you tell me? Do I seem like the leader or something"" she cut me off the second time. This time, it really pissed me off. She had done this before and I always made sure to stay quiet as to not make another fuss. I don't like conflicts because I can be quite the debater. 

She proceeded to spit out sarcastic remarks in front of our classmates in order to embarrass me further, I guess. So, I just stepped out and went to our office.

Now, I'm writing this with a really heavy feeling in my chest. I may just be pitying myself and being pathetic but I just feeƒ∫ sucky that I don't want to tell any of my friends how I really feel right now. I guess, having strangers read this and not judge you is better for me. What my friend said to me really just hurt me. But I don't want to admit that to anyone that knows me personally.

If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this post. Knowing someone knows how I feel is comfort enough."
There's nothing interesting to title this,"I feel inferior to others, especially my crush whom i asked out and told that i like him. He's so much more confident than me. Next to him i feel like i want to run and hide. No wonder he rejected me. Everybody is better than me. He is in a club, does karate, hangs out with friends and I'm always fucking lazy. I have no funny stories to tell. I do make music but that's very inconsistent and small. I feel small. Constantly listen to videos on self compassion, self love, confidence but i don't do anything with it. 
Anyways i can be proud of myself that I ASKED him out and I TOLD him how i feel.
He would never do that.
Good job meüëè"

Two Depressed people in a relationship,"I‚Äôm really struggling and need some support right now.  

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for a few months, and we clicked immediately.  We‚Äôve always been really forthcoming with our struggles with mental illness.  I tend to lean more into anxiety with sporadic bouts of depression.  He, on the other hand, is a full blown clinically depressed.

The depression started creeping up beginning of September.  At first it was subtle, and I was doing ok with dealing and understanding.  

But now, it‚Äôs manifested into full blown anxiety attacks on my end.  I can‚Äôt even joke around and be fun anymore, because I consider every thing he says to be to be a slight against me.  I‚Äôm misfiring and crying uncontrollably.  And I‚Äôm constantly battling between my intellect and what I know (he‚Äôs depressed, it‚Äôs not a choice, he doesn‚Äôt mean to pull away or hurt my feelings when he‚Äôs withdrawn, etc.) and my anxiety monologue (something is wrong, because I am wrong, and he‚Äôs not telling me because he wants me to break up with him/hurt me).

The major difference between us is, I have a support system.  I have group therapy, one on one therapy, and tools that I use to keep me in check.  But lately, I can feel my codependency on him being happy completely fuck with my own well being.

He says this is just how he is, and has been luke warm to my suggestions to see a therapist (though I know he believes in counseling and has gone in the past).

And it‚Äôs also screwed with our intimate side (which I think is a lot of the source of ire).  Sex is important, but my partner‚Äôs well being is of course more important.  I am usually the one initiating, but the last few weeks he‚Äôs been so down, we can‚Äôt connect on that level.  I have my own issues with self worth and feeling desired.  A previous ex of mine withheld sex as a means to get us to break up, so I am on high alert.

It‚Äôs really hard to hear he loves me and this has nothing to do with me, but to feel the actions he makes are contradictory.  I am really struggling to allow him this space to process and move through his depression without imploding on my end."
Does medication really help?,Be honest
It hasn‚Äôt been this bad in a long time.,"I‚Äôm feeling down. And I keep letting myself fall down the rabbit hole of despair, nostalgia, and fear. I suddenly realized there‚Äôs this giant void and nothing can help it anymore. I miss things. People. Who I used to be. What life used to look like. Nothing seems to matter anymore. I‚Äôm getting therapy set up this week, but I just need as much help as possible. 

Thanks friends "
I am broken and have never been this low before. I thought I was hurt after my dad died but losing a person you thought you‚Äôd spend your whole life with is next level. I just need someone to talk to.,It‚Äôs weird how one day you‚Äôre talking about marriage and a family and the next the person is gone. I just need someone to talk to so I can know if I‚Äôve truly given my all to this situation or if I can do more. The hardest part is accepting what you can and can‚Äôt change 
I never know what to say.,"I wish that I was suicidal. I am not.

I am miserable and anxious.

The problem is ultimately my job but it is not something from which I can walk away.

&#x200B;

I do and I do not want to talk about it.

My life is terrible but all life is beutiful.

I hate poetry but this feels, at the very least lyrical.

&#x200B;

I am going to go hurt my blood sugar and then take my meds for the night.

I want to cry but my soul is too dehydrated.

I hate going to sleep because then I'll be that much closer to repeating it.

Exhale.

Self-exhile.

Those who‚Äôve dealt with it longer than I - how?,"So I‚Äôm a 20 y.o. F who‚Äôs currently on her sophomore year in college. 
I was diagnosed with severe depression and a panic attack disorder about two years ago. 
Since then I‚Äôve dealt with two changes in medication, a suicide attempt and moving away to my own apartment and away from all my family and friends. 
Since starting school I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve become incredibly isolated. The only time I‚Äôll have human touch is when my boyfriend visits me for the weekend, and unless a professor or a group member speaks to me, generally throughout the day I won‚Äôt have a conversation with anyone.  Even my parents don‚Äôt talk to me everyday. 
I‚Äôve joined a DnD group and have made attempts to push myself out of this crippling isolation but how do you make friends when more than have your days are bad mental health days? 
My depression has worsened significantly since moving and to help myself I got a 3 month old puppy that I‚Äôm training to be my service animal. Honestly, that baby is most of the reason I get out of bed as puppies don‚Äôt care if you have depression - they need to be trained. 
I‚Äôve also made another doctors appointment to see about yet another med adjustment. I also got in contact with a therapist but I honestly don‚Äôt see how it will help much being as though I can only go to one session a month. 
I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to live like this? Like is this going to be my life from now on- just barely struggling by with less than a hand full of people who would actually give a shit if I failed miserably? 
I just need to hear from more experienced depressed individuals- how did you survive?"
"I feel my life is worthless, I'm ready to end it all, please help me. I've posted for help, and I don't know where to turn to now. I feel more depressed now than ever before in my life.","I've posted about my current situation in other subreddits asking for advice, people don't believe me. I don't know what to do. My posts get removed, I do not know why.

Here is my situation, I posted about this on tifu and other subreddits.

Throwaway account. This did not actually happen today, this has been a huge progressive fuck up that's been building up steam for months now. Please Reddit I need your help, and advice. Please!

I've been married for 25 years, currently have 4 kids, and let me tell you when you've been married for this long, lot's of things can get into your head, shit rattles around there, echoes, ferments in a way that other's sometimes just can't comprehend. At times I feel blessed to have been married for so long, but at times living in here Tallahassee, in bum fuck Florida, in a shitty rental just gets to yea, you know? Sometimes the stresses of parenthood can be at times almost suffocating, I hope at least some of you out here, anyone really can just understand where I'm coming from. Working as an insurance broker living paycheck to paycheck wasn't my dream job, yet its the one I have to make due with, but I guess all this shit really started just after my 4th son was born, at home my relationship with my wife begun souring. Bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboro's, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house I pay for like I always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me. She began blue balling me since then, she stopped wanting to have fun in bed, time, and time again I would go to her, try to get it on like I had done before, and I just got no love from her, she acted like a cold hearted pasty white bitch, and not just when I was looking to get it on with her. But this pattern, this taboo purgatory I now found myself in, it was nothing temporary it became a new acceptance, a new reality, a new sign of defeat for me. Not only did I now have to put up with a shitty job, in a small home, where I couldn't even relax in peace like I used to, but now my wife was cutting me off from the little bit of pleasure I found being with her. I had dedicated nothing but my whole life, finances, everything I had to our family, and now this is the thanks I got. She would tell me to go, and play, and spend time with the kids like I hadn't, when she knew damn well I was exhausted after work at night times. So I decided from then on I had to do something about this set of unfortunate circumstances I now faced.

Inspired to go have some fun, and have finally a release I well deserved; after work I began instead of going straight back to my prison of a home, I instead decided to go out to bars, nightclubs, telling my wife when she texted about where I was, that I was just burning the midnight oil, working hard filing paperwork, just making up job crap she wouldn't even look into anyways. At those clubs I had the time of my life. It became like an addiction to me. For weeks upon weeks I'd go to different nightclubs, and bar hop night after night after work, I didn't just savior my time there I indulged in it, there I'd hook up with women looking for more than just fun. For some reason during this time I was able to hook up with a few local black chicks that'd be hitting the club scene, never in my life did I ever think I as a blond ass kid from Pensacola would I be hooking up like this, most of the times after drinking, and chatting with them, we'd hang out in my car, and have some fun in a parking lot we'd drive to, and spend a few hours at, during this time I'd never use protection, maybe it was the combination of being drunk, or dazed but at that time I just didn't care. During this time I met this hot black chick with an afro, we'll call her ""Mandy"", and after dancing with her at a nightclub late one night we really hit it off, but after my typical one night stand, this girl was different. We grew to have a connection, as days went by we started getting flirty over texts, and soon I grew to have a secret relationship with her, while my wife knew nothing about it. I even took several ""business trips"" to her place during this time. Every time I went it was well worth it. At first she was very sweet to me, and considerate, we even smoked pot together, which for me was a first. Finally for once in my life I thought I had found the perfect work life, sex balance. I'd wake up, say bye to the kids, go to work, afterwards let loose at the clubs till 3am, come back while the wife is asleep, and so on. And finally with Mandy in the mix, I had someone to actually connect to when I wanted. Unlike my wife she was in her early 20s, my wife late 40s, I've seen garbage fires that look better than her. Mandy always gave excellent blowjobs, its like she had lips of an angel, unlike my wife who never gave me oral. But that's when everything went to shit. Mandy came to me two weeks ago, and stated she's pregnant. She took a test, and showed me the results. I don't know what to do, I can't let my wife, or kids find out. Mandy is threatening to tell my wife, about her, and the baby. She has been calling he angrily about this, she blames me for her pregnancy, but she wants to keep that baby. She tells me she doesn't want to be ""just the other woman."" She doesn't want to be ""a dirty little secret."" I don't know what to do. I got so angry at that fucking bitch, we got into a heated argument. I haven't been going to work for the past few days now, I've been making sure Mandy doesn't come to my house, if she does, I'm thinking of calling the cops on that thug. I can't let my wife, or my kids know the truth. I need your help, please, what should I do? I need help, and advice. I want to save the marriage, I can't let my kids go through a divorce, my wife still does not know anything. I hate this whole fucking situation. I hate my life, why the hell would this happen to me?? How can I convince Mandy not to tell my wife? I don't know what to do, should I get a restraining order on her? Please help me anyone, I don't know who to go to for help.

TL:DR had several affairs with women I met at nightclubs, hit it off really well with one, now she's pregnant, and wants to tell my wife!

Please help me, I don't want to live anymore, I'm thinking of running off, maybe buying a shotgun. Where can I turn to? Help please anyone. My life is worthless. I feel numb inside."
I feel like I'm failing in life in itself and it's serious.,I've always had a lazy streak but have worked years. I got laid off around a year ago. I guess I'm depressed because I can't get back on track. I'm very shy I don't like being around people even though I have been but now I dislike it even less and I'm not even looking for a job I'm just living off what I saved for years. And I don't go out much actually I've been like a hermit for almost a year so I was wondering if anybody actually was like this as well? I'm so embarrassed of myself.
The idea of self-love is absolutely preposterous to me still.,"I've been in various forms of therapy for most of my life, and yet still, the idea that I should ""love"" myself still seems just absolutely preposterous. *Why* should I love myself? I'm an envious, bitter, hateful, very unwell person as a result of what I've been through in my life, and the notion that I ought to love what I am is just ridiculous. I get that it's like a snake eating its own tail and that ""loving myself"" could reduce my negative personal qualities, but I struggle seeing anything lovable about me whatsoever. 

I've done positive affirmations, I've written letters to myself, I've hugged myself at times even, and I've written out list after list of my positive attributes. Nothing helps make the idea of loving myself at all easier. 

Anyone else struggle with this?"
If more people talked about mental illness less people would die., My depression was triggered by the death of my father and ever since I    have been on a roller-coaster of emotions. Help get word out that it is    okay to have a mental illness and share your story. I use my blog to   share the experience and to help others by letting them know they're  not   alone [https://notokayisalsookay.wordpress.com](https://notokayisalsookay.wordpress.com/) 
After years of issues I've just been diagnosed with Schizophrenia. Here are my tips for dealing with the negative symptoms i.e. depression and lethargy.,"I hope this is not patronising because each person's set of problems are, of course, complex and unique. Some things in life are difficult to control but there are many things you can control. I think the most important thing to do is to give yourself ambitions then make a plan to achieve them. Hopefully you'll find yourself dreaming about the future rather than ruminating about your problems. Here's what helped me:

Stop drinking completely. You may think you're only having a little every now and then but when your mind is not in great shape anyway, a little can have a big negative effect that lasts for days. Alcohol is of course, a depressant. Giving up completely may sound daunting especially considering how synonymous it is with socialising in Western cultures but there are now some good non-alcoholic alternatives available in shops and pubs. Alcohol free wine is still absolutely ghastly however. Try going at least a month without drinking. I expect the same goes for recreational drugs or gambling. I don't know much about those though.

Exercise as often as you can and eat healthily. The endorphins make you feel better, you'll get in shape and will get a sense of achievement form being able to run/swim/cycle etc faster and further. If you join a club you'll make some good friends too. Personally I think gyms are depressing as fuck unless perhaps you're there with a friend. Group classes are good though. Track your progress in a log to give yourself motivation. Go out even if it's raining. Once you've warmed up it's great.

Give yourself a project or ambition to work on. Immerse yourself in whatever you find interesting and find people who are interested in the same things even if it's just here on reddit. You might feel right now that you've lost interest in just about everything but there's probably something from your past that you could pick up again. Or it could be something totally new. Some examples: learn a new language, a musical instrument, making something, art, photography, reading, coding, maths, CAD. I hesitate to include gaming because a lot of games seem designed just to give instant gratification which I don't think helps much. I think longer term goals and a sense of achievement and pride are key here. Just pick something to work on and do it regularly. Share what you do with other people.

Minimise your social media use. There have been quite a few studies now that show a correlation between social media use and depression. Dial down the notification settings on your accounts and phone and relegate the apps to the last page. I'm not telling you to get rid of facebook completely because it has its uses but don't just endlessly scroll. Same goes for reddit. Try to keep your phone in your pocket unless necessary.

Find a few close friends you can confide in about how you feel. Therapists are good but expensive and time is limited with them. Good friends are better imo. Maybe some of them are having problems too. You could help them and feel good about it.

Get some quality sleep. Go to bed on time and don't allow distractions like your phone. If you have insomnia try having some ambient noise on in the background like white noise or recordings of waterfalls or thunderstorms. There's a ton of stuff like that on Spotify. You'll want a premium account though to get rid of the ads. There's also Sleep Radio. Also important is getting out of bed on time. Have a little routine. Get up, make your bed, have a shower, sing Feeling Good and don't give a shit who hears.

Recognise when you're ruminating and make yourself stop. This is hard. Sitting around thinking about how terrible everything is only makes the feelings worse. Don't feel guilty about it but do something to drag yourself out of that hole and break the cycle. Get up and do something. Do that thing you've been putting off doing. Clean the kitchen. If you're doing it in bed try thinking about what you want to achieve tomorrow.

Avoid shift work. It's really not good for you.

Get a pet. Or even just a plant. Look after it well.

Listen to music but avoid the genres and songs that just enforce negative emotions. If you get distracted by the lyrics easily then try instrumental music like classical or jazz.

Spend more time around nature.

Help other people with their problems. It's rewarding.

This last one is going to be very controversial: Make a small effort to be cheerful and friendly. Hopefully you'll find it rubs off on other people then they make you a bit happier too. Say good morning to the people you meet like the bus driver or the person behind the till. I'm not saying that you have to go around pretending that everything is fine but little things like asking 'how are you?' can help lift someone else's mood and in turn could lift yours."
Has anyone tried online or phone therapy? Any recommendations?,"Over the winter, I had been looking for a therapist in my city. After reaching out to several therapist with no replies, I just figured I didn't sound like a good candidate to them and I kind of got lazy and put it off. I have state insurance so maybe that's unappealing to therapists? 

Anyway I just tried to deal with my issues on my own and it was working ok for a few months. Then a month later the whole world kinda ended with this pandemic and people getting sick. Now the dread has returned times a million and I feel like I just can't cope on my own anymore. I know there so many others who have it WAY worse than myself. I have only been financially affected. I'm young and still healthy but I just can't pull myself out of this black hole. All my old problems have been dumped on with new problems from this pandemic and now its overflowing. I hyperventilate every time I think about my future and how I will pay my bills (event/gig worker here) on top of all the issues that I had before this.

Does anyone have advice or recommendations for online therapy or even phone therapy?"
something to do when you need something to distract yourself,"The world is a shitty place right now. everyone is stressed and bad feelings are spiking. so here‚Äôs what i give to all of you: a piece of advice to keep you going when everything is going wrong. 

draw a flower. 

draw a large flower, a small one, draw one with 4 petals or one with 50. it doesn‚Äôt matter how good or bad you are at art. you don‚Äôt need good supplies, it doesn‚Äôt even need to be on its own sheet of paper. draw a flower in a book, a notebook, on your bed frame, wherever you want. 

everything is getting dark, emotionally. sometimes it helps to take 5 minutes and distract yourself with a little flower."
Hello I need a reason to wake up tommorow,"Yep, thats all. Im a uni student under coronavirus lockdown, alone in an apartment. Lately I have been sleeping through days because I cant bring myself to wake up, especially since there is nowhere to go and only class work to do. 

Leaving this post here so I wake up to check it tomorrow. 

You can comment anything, ask me something if you want. Im a Business undergrad student. I have lived in the USA UK Azerbaijan and Angola. Im an introvert and have social anxiety. Uh.. thats pretty much it. Also I want to write a book someday (who doesn't?)."
Can anyone who has dealt with sexual assault relate to this,"I hate people telling me that I‚Äôm strong and that I‚Äôm brave. Fuck I cry almost every other day and I struggle with my self worth constantly. I‚Äôm afraid to take my pit bull outside to pee at night and to walk from the parking lot to my apartment which is a 50ft distance alone. I just don‚Äôt get why I‚Äôm being praised for something bad happening to me and it‚Äôs frustrating, I just don‚Äôt know how to respond to that. When my friends say things like ‚Äúif I ever see him again, I‚Äôd (insert violence)‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt make me feel good. And then I start to think that they‚Äôre only saying that because it makes them feel good to be angry on my behalf. Idk it‚Äôs been pretty fucked lately."
REPEAT AFTER ME completing something half ass is better than not doing it at all.,"I mean a productive thing that you're putting off.

 Hopefully this helps. 

If you're looking for a sign this is it!"
I need help,"I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, I just want to die. I‚Äôm in the darkest parts of depression and i have no support system. 
My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt understand, he just asks ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you just choose to be happy?‚Äù And I have no answer for him. I wish I could ‚Äújust be happy‚Äù  I need him to love me and give me the support, just to feel wanted and loved... but instead I get called names like a Goblin!  he‚Äôs just so cold. My eyes are puffy from constantly crying..
My mother says I should move in with her, but that relationship can be even more toxic. 
I also suffer from anxiety and BPD. So not only am I terrified to leave the house, I have an extremely fear of FOMO. which leaves me feeling, I don‚Äôt even know.... and I‚Äôm stuck in a city I hate. I wanna move back home so badly to Seattle... but I‚Äôm stuck in Ohio for another year. And I truly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll survive it. Please help me."
I need someone to talk to.,I‚Äôve been hit with a depression episode lately this week and I need someone to talk about it too. Just a person that‚Äôs willing to be kind and listen and give me advice.
"Every Time It Gets Better, It Gets Worse","Every time I manage to dig myself out of the hole bit by fragile bit, something inevitably pushes me back below. Something small, something big, something as simple as the passage of time. A single bad day, a single bad conversation. When things finally, *finally* start looking up something awful always happens to bring me back down. What do you do when this happens? How do you stop the downward spiral you know is coming? I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so tired."
Does anyone have advice for how to deal with feeling hollow and disconnected from people?,"So last night me and one of my buddies, who I am very close to, had a discussion on what‚Äôs been going on in my head. Lately I have been feeling super sad and borderline suicidal because I have been focusing on my childhood and have come to the realization that I had an abusive childhood. My abuse was mostly psychological and verbal, but it still hurt and I can still feel it to this day. 

Anyways, last night me and my buddy were discussing how my childhood was abusive and how I try to reach out to others (particularly women) for comfort, because I feel that I was denied affection by my mother while growing up.

All through the conversation, it didn‚Äôt feel like I was connecting with my friend, only my internal emotions and sorrow. It felt like the mini therapy session we were having was doing little. After leaving I felt hollow on the inside. It lasted till about noon this morning. Felt completely worthless and useless.

I was wondering if anyone had tips for what to do when feeling hollow and how to better connect to people."
I‚Äôve decided that on May 3rd I will decide if I should or shouldn‚Äôt kill myself.,"I think a month is long enough. Also, the meds will have the therapeutic effect around that time. 
So, I hope that everything is actually better by then. If not, I won‚Äôt go on anymore. Seems fair."
Finally spoke to my parents about my depression. Their reaction wasn't quite what I had thought.,"I (20M) have been living with depression for the better part of a year now. I was always afraid to tell my parents because they worry too much, and I didn't want them neglecting their own health over mine.

However, the circumstances over the past few days, added with the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent quarantine has broken me like no other, and I finally opened up to my parents about my feelings.

They told me to ""stop being a baby"" and to just ""snap out of it"".

What do I do now? I have never felt so lost in my life. And this is coming from a person who hasn't had a proper social interaction in more than a year. 

Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you."
Terrible heavy physical pain in my chest when I‚Äôm sad. Tips to make it go away?,"I have not been diagnosed with depression or anything I‚Äôm not sure if I have to have been before I make a post here but I‚Äôm out of options. I am 2 types of medication that have side effects including depression,anxiety etc all the bad stuff. 

I‚Äôve never got this feeling before I went on them so I know it‚Äôs the meds. I tried coming off then and everything stayed the same so I think I‚Äôm stuck feeling like this now

Usually something triggers me and I get an awful pain in my chest that I would describe as just so painful and terrible. It‚Äôs not an organ pain or something I know it‚Äôs a mental one. The only way I‚Äôve figured out to get rid of it was s***h**** but in trying to stop. Does anyone experience this or have tips in general to get rid of it??

Sorry if this does not have enough info, this is my first post here I‚Äôm in desperate need of advice or help. It‚Äôs getting worse by the day and I will try anything. 


Thank you"
I made a suicide plan and it scares me,"I'm not intending to commit suicide. But I came up with a plan, for the event that I changed my mind, I guess. I've struggled with depression/anxiety for a long time, but I've never had as concrete an idea of how I would do it until now. And that really scares me.  


I have a neurological disorder that causes chronic pain and muscle spasms, and I feel like it's deteriorating my normal level of function. I have considered myself high-functioning for a long time. I've been in and out of therapy (currently out) for years, but it's never been helpful. 

Therapists have told me I seem very self-aware, but that I'm closed off. It's a struggle to talk to anyone about anything personal, especially if it's negative. So this is really hard for me, to post like this. I'm hoping the anonymity of the internet makes it easier.   


I don't feel like I can talk to anyone in my life about this. I don't want them to know, or blame themselves, or worry. But the dissociation and suicide ideation are getting really bad, and I don't know what to do."
My mom makes me feel worse and I hate how shitty of a person she is,"It took me years of being severely depressed until she finally acknowledged it. Her initial reactions were ""you have no reason to be depressed"" and started making it about herself. Of course she immediately defends herself and says she has nothing to do with the way I'm feeling and how great of a mother she has always been and how she doesn't understand why I'd say I'm depressed.

Meanwhile my home life here with her is 80% of the cause of my depression. She used to be an awful alcoholic and smoker. She would get drunk every other night and sometimes I'd find her on the floor mumbling to herself completely out of her mind. You shouldn't have to go through that shit as a child. She threw me across the room one night just because I stepped in her way. 

She was never there for me, never understood the shit I was going through at home and at school, always made my issues about herself. Only just recently has she been paying the copay for my therapy as I can't afford it right now as freshman in college. 

It initially helped me cope with my shit, as I used to go once a week but I've been forced to go once every three weeks. Now I can't go at all because she's cancelling the card linked to the therapy because she doesn't feel like helping me anymore. I'm on the wrong medication for my depression and I need a psychiatrist, as my depression has only gotten worse in the past month or two of being on it and now I don't know what to do.

If I can't afford to go to therapy anymore and never be able to get that psychiatrist, my mental health will only severely decline from here and there's no telling what I might do to alleviate this pain. NONE of my family members are supportive. My dad doesn't give a shit, and neither does my sister. No one has any idea how serious this shit is except for my boyfriend, who is the only supportive and understanding person in my life. I hate my family so much, they don't give a shit about my mental health and never will. I bet if I killed myself they'd say something like ""I only wish I could've been there for her more"" at my funeral and make it all about them."
Left work early today with every intention of hanging myself from the tree in my back yard...,"And I pussied out...

I have no will or reason to live. I hate my job. I feel like I just live to work. Getting the company owner to pay his employees what he owes is a constant battle. He tries anything he can to fuck his employees out of their money. Even going so far as to threaten to take us to court for trying to challenge him, knowing that we can't afford it. I'm a sprinkler fitter apprentice and the entire company is basically run by apprentices. We have 3 journeymen out of about 20 people. One of those is a service guy, another is the superintendent. Only one journeymen actually works on jobs. It's illegal to have jobs run by apprentices, without a journeyman on site. Like two months ago the boss went off in a safety meeting about another employee being on a job by himself. Now, I'm on a job by myself with even less experience. He constantly bods jobs that we can't man so, we basically have one person per job at this point. 

I feel completely trapped. This is the only job experience I have. I've always found it extremely hard to get jobs because I have a really hard time with interviews. And it's hard to explain to people that I spent the first years of my adult life homeless and didn't get my first real job until I was 27. 

I rent a place with my dad. He got a DUI a while back and it's taking a lot of his money. I hate the place we live. I'm pretty much just confined to my room whenever I'm home. I can't get my own place because he won't be able to afford the place of I move out. Again, I feel completely trapped.

So, I went home early today. I have a rope that somebody gave me a while back that I tied into a noose. I stood at my back door for a good half hour, looking at the tree I want to hang myself from. But, I couldn't do it. Why? Because I'm too fucking scared of a couple minutes of pain leading up to my death. Or that somebody is going to see and try to talk me out of it. Or that I'll fuck it up and just end up permently disabling myself, but not dieing. Or what my dad's reaction would be when he comes home to see me hanging g over his fire pit. Even though when I first told him I wanted to kill myself, he said do it. So, I ended up laying down and fell asleep. Woke up to pouring ran and yet another reason to despise myself. I have no desire to live yet, I'm too much of a scared little bitch to go through with killing myself.

I have no real friends. I rarely get out. I'm a PC gamer. It's pretty much the only thing that distracts me from the fact that I despise being alive. So, everyone I talk to is online. Idk why I'm even posting this. I'm just gonna get the same generic bullshit replies that always come up when somebody mentions wanting to die but, here I am. I've never come this close to actually killing myself and all I can think is what a bitch I am for not being able to follow through with it."
Need friend to speak,I need friend to talk any true friends there
Sometimes I feel the only reason I don't end it all,"is because I would break my father's heart. That is the only reason. He has invested so much in me, time money and energy, I would feel like he would feel like he failed, and I feel ungrateful just saying it. I make no difference in nobody else's life, I've always been a super lonely person. That's the only thing that keeps me here :(."
I don‚Äôt know how to keep going.,"This week I was sent to the hospital for an attempt, lost a relationship, burned a lot of friendships, damaged my car, and scared the hell out of my family-who now knows I‚Äôm depressed. My friends don‚Äôt see me, they don‚Äôt understand, they aren‚Äôt there for me at all. Those that are there I feel like I‚Äôm reaching the point of annoyance with. I can‚Äôt sleep, can‚Äôt eat, can‚Äôt focus on anything other than the way I‚Äôve failed everyone around me. I‚Äôm trying so very very hard to hold on, but I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep this up. I can‚Äôt see a positive end to any of this. I just want to disappear. I just need someone to care.

Edit: 
To everyone who offered kind words, understanding, and advice, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. This is my first ever reddit post and I am blown away by the amount of support I have received. Truly a beautiful thing to feel so loved by total strangers."
I can't open up to anyone,"I just don't have anyone to open up to. I've never been close to my sister, and my dad hates me. the only person in my close family I could talk to is my mum, and I don't want to tell her just how bad I feel all the time, because she gets really stressed about everything, and I don't wanna hurt her. I'm not nearly close enough to any of my friends to talk to them about how i feel. I keep posting online, reaching out because i need to feel like somebody cares. and as supportive as everyone has been every single time, I need a shoulder to cry on. I need a hug more than anything in the world, and I can't have it.  


Edit: wow, I got to the top of the sub! I've gotten a lot of replies, so I'm really sorry if I don't get to everybody! thank you all for being so supportive!"
I‚Äôm so fucking lonely man i‚Äôm getting real bad real quick,"I beg all my friends to do something every day but no one has time for me, i don‚Äôt even know what to say i have no hope left at all. All i want is to be able to have someone to at least try and be happy with, i‚Äôm really close to the edge here idk if i‚Äôm gonna start cutting or kill myself or what. I don‚Äôt even want anyone here to try and help because i know no one can help me with this i just need to express how i feel.

Edit: i appreciate the people trying to help me, but i really genuinely did not make this post looking for help, please stop trying to offer me advice. I realise i made it in the wrong sub, it is a post to tell myself how i feel, nothing anyone can say can help me. I am so deeply lonely and heartbroken by losing not only someone else, but also the progress i made with that person that i am really, really beyond help."

We are not able to see each other at all during this. I‚Äôm really scared he is going to hurt himself. Our state just got extended to the thirtieth of may and he is just terrible after the news. What do I do? What can I do? I‚Äôm so worried.

Never keep fighting. I wanted to give up so many times. Some days are incredible difficult but just keep your head down and push through. 

There‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel. 

Much love."
Tired of it all,"Who else is just tired of it all? Tired of making everyone else happy, tired of dissapointing everyone, tired of constantly pretending you are strong and nothing can bring you down..? 

Growing up whenever I tried to talk about what I am feeling no one listened and would always change the subject. So I would never talk about it and now that I am an adult and married it's really hard to talk about how I feel because everyone expects me to be strong.."
Yeeeah first shower in...a long time!,"Yeeeah first shower in...a long time!  Looking for some nice snugly clothes to wear after I get out.

But first shower in omg...about. 6-8 weeks :( . But man it was a effort get into to the mindset to do so. Really need some support to keep doing them!"
"Mixed shrooms, wax edibles, and 2-liter of Sunkist; never been the same since... help?","Two years ago, I was depressed because my best friend did not like me the way I loved her. I decided that night to mix the remaining drugs I had to see if I could enjoy the rest of my night. Big mistake. I felt a feeling so bizarre and horrifying; I faced reality and myself(I). I had to battle several delusions about the universe, who I was, if heaven and hell existed, and I was able to best most of them and got better over the year, but I have never been the same since then. I constantly think about reality and the experienced/observer of it, and briefly had night terror episodes where I‚Äôd have this intense pressure in my right ear and wouldn‚Äôt be able to move and I‚Äôd float out of my body. Sometimes, I have these panic attacks where I know I‚Äôm about to think about the unsolvable questions and I can‚Äôt stop it. I want to go back to the way I was, I didn‚Äôt know that this would happen to me. I‚Äôm fine on the outside and manage these things well, but I have no idea if I‚Äôve forsaken myself forever. Thinking about all of these deep questions hurts me. Love any advice from anyone, I know I‚Äôm not alone, but whenever these thoughts and weirdness happen, I feel very isolated and everyone seems fake/asleep"
There‚Äôs probably something wrong with me idk,"English isn‚Äôt my first language so sorry if I make mistakes..

It‚Äôs a long story and I‚Äôm sure everyone reading this will think I‚Äôm weird.

So I think I‚Äôm probably gay but it‚Äôs been really weird and I‚Äôm not even sure. Years ago I started to feel that I don‚Äôt like my appearance and it almost feels like my brain or whatever desperately wants me to be in a different body, that is, the same gender as me of course. I always tell myself that it‚Äôs not okay but that‚Äôs not how really how your inner self work. 
The thing is, the change that I (for some reason) want is to get fat. It‚Äôs weird because I wasn‚Äôt really that skinny anyway. I always imagined as a kid that my soul was too big for my body, and I‚Äôm pretty sure as a teenager that‚Äôs definitely not the case.
I think about this more and more and it‚Äôs been bugging me for some time now. 
I have a friend who‚Äôs probably what that inner self (sorry idk what to call that inner voice that keeps bugging me) considers to be my ideal body. (I know it sounds creepy) I started to feel that I always wanted him to live better than me. 

**There is one thing to make clear: although I think I might be gay, I don‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúlove‚Äù him, he‚Äôs just a good friend from my high school and we hang out a lot.**

He once broke his arm and, when I heard the news, I just snapped. I have broken my arm before and it wasn‚Äôt even that painful. But for some reason, that day when he broke his arm I feel so weird deeply that I don‚Äôt even know what that feeling is. I started to be very protective of him and it‚Äôs started to annoy him a bit. At first these thoughts seemed fine until recently when it started to drive me suicidal.
I get worried every time he goes to play basketball, skiing or whatever after that. It‚Äôs making anxious, and I can‚Äôt even tell him bc he will just think I‚Äôm weird and not believe in me. I know you would think none of this make sense, trust me, I think that too. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with me and it‚Äôs just making me confused and terrified to face the future. It sure doesn‚Äôt sound serious but when you have to deal with these weird voices coming from nowhere, it‚Äôs a totally different story.
I just have to figure out a way to sort out this mess or it will likely keep bugging me until the day I finally decided to hang myself or whatever.

Sorry for the long post btw"
I need someone to talk to right now,"I need someone to talk to right now, we can talk about almost anything I don't care, I just need to fill the empty gap in my mind that's filling up with destructive thoughts"
I can‚Äôt shake feeling depressed when I have no reason to be,"It was a rough morning. My husband (M30) and I (F26) had a meeting this morning to get my 3 year old enrolled in an all day pre-k program for the fall, which is pretty hard to get into in my area, and it just seemed like everything that could have went wrong did. I brought our two kids to the car and my hubby forgot to grab the birth certificate we needed that I‚Äôd laid out for him to grab. We thought where we needed to go was much closer than it was so we ended up being late. And it just seemed like a lot of small irritations kept coming up as we tried to get there.

But then we did get there. And honestly? Everything went really well.  Like, we were in and out within 15 minutes and are all set to have him attend in the fall. Yet.. I‚Äôm just frustrated. My husband is wonderful, and spent the little bit of time he had before leaving for work trying really hard to help but I just can‚Äôt shake this mood even though this all happened like two hours ago. I just feel.. depressed. It‚Äôs like my mind starts feeling upset and even when the issue is resolved I can‚Äôt shake the feeling and I just don‚Äôt feel like doing anything at this point at all. I‚Äôm a stay at home mom, so I‚Äôm home with my two young kiddos, but just don‚Äôt know how to flip how I‚Äôm feeling. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some motivation.. this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened and generally my day ends up being pretty terrible when this does happen and I really don‚Äôt want that. I just feel stuck. Any advice? "
Need advice for holding a job while depressed.,"I'm looking for some advice from folks suffering through depression who are able to hold down a job. I seem to no longer be able to do so any more. The only work I can get in my area is call center work, which is such a terrible soul crushing job to do that once I add my depression on top of it, it never lasts long. I have been doing it on and off for the last 12 years and was able to hold on for around a year or two to six months at a time, but the last time I tried I made it one day before quitting. I just can't muster the fake sympathy and pretending to care about the callers issues anymore. But I need to work to live. I have tried shorter shifts, and even part time, but I always end up sitting outside before my shift starts unable to walk through the doors knowing what the next 8 hours are going to require of me. "
I‚Äôm in therapy,Lots of highs and lows. Lots of pretending to be okay and feeling numb. Lots of drinking and/or smoking to escape. Lots of things negatively effecting things and people in my life. I‚Äôm so tired I wanted a change. Yesterday was my first therapy session. Homegirl jumped right into it discussing what may trigger my depressive state etc. I think I may like her... hopefully I stick it out.
I have no one.,"I‚Äôve been wanting to talk about this with someone for a while, but I have quite literally no one to talk to. I‚Äôm don‚Äôt make enough money to go to therapy sessions so this is the next best thing I guess. To start out, I have been rather tall and thin my entire life, it was never a problem, until high school started. As a girl it‚Äôs even harder to have the type of body I have. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 112 lbs.. Anyways, the summer before my sophomore year of high school my dad moved my family to an extremely rural area on the other side of the county, so naturally I had to start at a new high school where I knew absolutely no one. The school I started was full of racist rednecks and I had never been exposed to those type of people. This is pretty funny (and I can‚Äôt wait until the day where I‚Äôm not so depressed about it that I can laugh about it) but on my very first day, this girl in my science class told the whole class that ‚Äúshe heard the new girl bleaches her asshole‚Äù lmao I know completely random. Well I have a dry sense of humor so when people asked me if I did I would sarcastically say yes, and they told other people that they asked me and I said yes. So for the rest of the year I was called ‚Äúbutthole bleacher‚Äù and I haven‚Äôt shared this info with anyone bc I‚Äôm so embarrassed. This group of boys would always tell me how disgusting my body is and how I was shaped like a boy. I went home everyday crying because I had no idea people I didn‚Äôt even know could be so cruel. This one boy in particular would tell me to kill myself every.  single. day. He was not joking at all which made it worse. I had no friends (still don‚Äôt), was told how ugly I was everyday, and was now just known as a girl who bleaches her butthole (it‚Äôs ok to laugh at it, I know it‚Äôs funny for people who aren‚Äôt me) I remember one day in particular I was walking by a group of redecks and this guy goes ‚Äúthere‚Äôs the flatass who fucks everyone‚Äù . I was shocked and went into class crying. I was confused, I have still never even kissed anyone so I couldn‚Äôt understand where people were getting this information from. You may be thinking I‚Äôm over exaggerating but I‚Äôm not kidding when I say that everyday I was made fun of by mainly boys for being so skinny. The day I hit rock bottom was in dance class. I had just recently experienced a ton of problems at home and the constant bullying made my depression way worse. I had made no friends in the dance class and the time came for a group dance. I waited until the last group went in fear of being made fun of, and in front of the whole entire gym, the whole group as I began to approach them said ‚Äúno, no, no we don‚Äôt want you‚Äù and the ENTIRE gym laughed. after dance class was last period where the mean boy was. He noticed I was sad and told me I should probably just kill myself. Everyone was taking about me on the bus ride home that day, and I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I took a rope, ladder, and my phone and climbed as high as I could up a tree in my yard. I was crying and playing my favorite song ‚ÄúAmerican Pie‚Äù. Then I saw my dad pull into the drive way, and I couldn‚Äôt do it. Then, things began to turn around. I was excepted into the dual enrollment program at the community college, so for my entire junior and senior  year, I‚Äôve been going to the community college full time and have not stepped foot into that school. I love physics so I decided to major in engineering, But, i got a D in calculus II last semester so I was kicked out of the program and since  I had all my credits for high school, I just began working full time at my job. I still have never had a boyfriend or even my first kiss. I‚Äôm so lonely and feel so ugly. Although now I‚Äôve accepted the fact that I‚Äôm just not attracted to the opposite sex apparently. Anyways, I found out I actually had enough credit hours to get my AA before even graduating high school, so I got that last week. I‚Äôm just so depressed and I literally have no friends. Like I‚Äôm not exaggerating at all. None. I feel so lonely and embarrassed. Next week is high school graduation and today I had to go pick of my cap + gown from high school during the senior luncheon. As soon as I walked in all of the horrible memories came back and I got the worst anxiety attack I‚Äôve ever had. I pulled myself together and got in the line to get the cap and gown. And then heard a group of boys saying my name and staring at me so I looked over and  a bunch of girls laughed. Then, the group forced a gap in line right where I was standing and said loudly ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù, while the rest of the group laughed. I felt so humiliated. I have to actually walk with these assholes next Saturday and I‚Äôve never wanted to not do anything more. I just want some friends that I can lean back on when shit like this happens but as aforementioned I have absolutely none. The only thing that keeps me going anymore is my hope that my future will be better. I got into University of Florida so I‚Äôll be starting in the fall. I‚Äôm pretty excited for a fresh start even though it‚Äôs just an hour a way from where I live. But to be honest, I‚Äôm so sad right now and I‚Äôm back in a rut. I can‚Äôt eat, my mom has  to force me to shower or even brush my teeth. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Thanks if you got this far. Advise to keep going?"
I just wanna talk,"I'm 20 years old from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I've no friends around here cause I move to here about 2 years ago and after all this time I still making no friends. I've a lot to say, just wanna start a conversation with another people of my age or older. Idk, I think I'm too old for my age you know? I've many doubts about what I'm doing with my life. Maybe I'm little depressed so I think talk will help. 
Anyone?

Thanks a lot.

I just want to stop existing,"I‚Äôm terrified of death and not knowing what comes after it, but I don‚Äôt see life as something precious or valuable. All I see is suffering and endless hopelessness. I am losing interest in everything and I can feel myself slipping away. It‚Äôs been like this for so long I don‚Äôt know what happiness feels like and I spend my days drifting in a mixture of self loathing and numbness. I‚Äôm so tired and find sleep to be my only escape. School on top of my struggling really exhausts me mentally and physically. I‚Äôm scared to die, but falling asleep for a really long time just sounds so nice. Even then though, I‚Äôd have to wake up and face the cruel reality that there really isn‚Äôt anything to be happy about. And it hurts because I can‚Äôt escape it. No matter how many nights I spend trying to cry the pain away it‚Äôs still there. I have no motivation to really change my life either though, I physically can‚Äôt force myself no matter how much I want to, to do anything productive. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this, does anybody know what to do? I‚Äôm overflowed with these feelings and I can‚Äôt help but feel the only way to get some release besides sleep is to harm myself, even if I know it‚Äôs not going to help in the end. I‚Äôm just done and I can‚Äôt keep up with school or my relationships anymore. I need some advice on what to do :("
Sleeping in?,"Hey guys one of my biggest struggles with my depression is my lack of motivation to get out of bed. Does anyone have any tips besides the usual (use favorite song for alarm, put alarm across the room, etc) to help me get out of bed?"
Should I use the psychological help service that my university provides for free?,"Lately I've been feeling really low. 
I can't make myself leave the bed, I start crying out of the blue and everything is just so heavy. 
I think I've always suffered from some kind of depression but I've never been to therapy because I couldn't afford it on my own and my family didn't ever suspect anything. 
Now I live on my own in another city. Yesterday I discovered that my university provides psychological help for students for free. Do you think I should give it a go? 
I'm a bit afraid because I don't know what to expect and I don't really know what to tell them when I'll be there. I know they don't provide help for very serious issues (you'll need a psychiatrist for that) and I hope they don't take care for only ""university related problems"".
On the other hand, I have nothing to lose because it's free.
Did you ever try anything like that? 
"
how should I deal with this,"I've been struggling with this for quite some time for now and I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts recently. I'm always saying I'm fine and that I'm okay. but I'm not. I'm very much not okay. every day my parents yell and bash me because I haven't been doing so well in school lately. I come from a very religious family and I've always been forced to go to church and pray, so basically it been shoved down my throat for years by my parents despite me telling them I didn't want to go. Many reasons stem from why I don't believe in the religion they want me to follow and basically its because I don't follow and I don't agree with their ideas and their way of treating each other. now I know this sounds off topic but let me get there. I am currently and have been for a while, struggling to find out who I am. sexuality wise and identity wise. What I've concluded is that I am a Bi-sexual male. though I can't openly express this to my parents because their beliefs think its ""wrong"" to be anything else but heterosexual. I feel like I'm going to be judged so much for just being...me. And being a male growing up to a father who some would call the typical man, held expectations on me as a male to me well...manly. and I've never been the super manly type and I can see and feel the disappointment in my dad's tone and attitude towards me. There's so much pressure on me being a male and coming from a family that is so judgmental towards ""different"" people. I feel like I'm being crushed by these expectations and pressure. My father never cared about me and only gets mad at my flaws and failures because it hurts his own self-image. he's admitted this many times. I would be crying and no one would bat an eye. I was crying in front of my father yelling at him ""I just want to be happy"" and he told me to suck it up and stop whining. I felt so pointless and hopeless. So unimportant to my dad.

All of this piled and piled on me and I would never show my feelings because again, it wasn't ""manly"" to show your feelings. I feel so trapped and crushed under these things. It would get to the point that I would cut myself just to feel something. I felt so numb and dead both inside and outside. I've made dates to kill myself but never followed through. I tried reaching out for help before but no one listened. My parents don't understand that someone could hate themselves or be this depressed. Whenever someone asks me if I'm okay or how I'm doing I always respond with I'm fine. I'm really not. At this point, I just want to be happy. nothing interests me anymore and nothing seems interesting. I can't do anything without thinking ""what's the point, why am I doing this. there's nothing that will pay off from doing this"". I feel so empty and alone. I push away friends and people I care about because I don't want them to see me and judge me for who I am. I feel hopeless. I feel like I'm drowning in this horror. I need to get help but I'm too scared...

I just wanted to share this because I needed to get it off my chest. This was the first place I thought of because I feel like I won't be judged here."
Thick thighs and heavy sighs,"My first post. 
I am incredibly depressed and have been for almost six months now. I recently moved and every time something goes wrong I can only feel like I've f*cked up my life completely and want to disappear. I can't go home, but being in this new place feels like death. I never seem to be able to make the right decision. My SO and my family love me, but I can feel my pain only making it more difficult for them. I love them so much and dont want to keep burdening the people who I care about most with my crippling depression. 
I have been to counseling, but because of a traumatic experience in my youth, placing myself in the dynamic of trusting someone when then proved to be not the safe place they were supposed to be, this is not really an option. 
So hello internet. I exist. I love my family. I just hate myself."
Feeling like an absolute pile of rubbish. Psychiatrist has put me on another pill.,"From UK. Long story short been diagnosed with depression since 14. Cureently 29. GPs tried me on 8 different types of SSRIs in various dosages with and without benzos for anxiety. Been to many therapies and counselling sessions.
In 2014 i got really bad after the death of my nan who raised me. I was referred to a psychiatrist who i believe saved my life.
He rediagnosed me with unipolar treatment resistant depression with anxiety. He put me on a TCA called lofepramine at 240 mg a day. This is not what the pill is licensed for however he has found through his research thats when the medication works best. (Had a lot of gps having problems with prescribing me dosage because of it, even with a letter from him) it also has a short half life and as I was a suicide risk, it was the safest option.
Been on it for a while. This week he has prescribed me another TCA amitriptyline. I also am in weekly therapy (currently mindfulness)

Anyway, i just hate the fact i have to take pills. Everyone has their demons and one of mine is feeling weak for taking medication. And now i have to take another type. It makes me feel so shit, so incapable of functioning like a 'normal' human being. My self hatred is so high and I can't switch off the thoughts.

Guess i just wanted to see if anyone else is currently taking two types of antidepressants too and how they have been getting on?

Thanks and apologies for the extremely melodramatic post

Edit: Thank you to everyone that replied to my post, I really appreciate you all taking a little bit out of your time to help a stranger on the internet. 
I'm not too good at really talking about things so I apologise for not replying to everyone individually.

Thank you all for your kind and motivational words."
Man I hate this feeling,"I don‚Äôt actively feel sad. I can sort of manage sad.

What‚Äôs bothering me is there‚Äôs things I *want* to do, but I‚Äôm just so unmotivated to do anything.

It sucks.

I want to draw, I tried but it isn‚Äôt working. 

I want to work on my programming project that I‚Äôm really excited about, but I can‚Äôt manage working on it for more than 10 minutes.

Same thing with this edit I‚Äôm making.

Normally video games are my go-to when anything like this happens, but I can‚Äôt get into any of them.

I hate this."
My boring life,"I thought I had everything.

I was the best.

Who wouldn't like a smart person kind enough to listen to everything you have to say. Always open to new information. Always wanting adventure and to learn something new. Patient enough to underatand your point of view. 

That was years ago.

This is today. I haven't slept in two days. I haven't had a good night of sleep in four years. My eyes are flooded with tears. I can't get out of bed to do anything. People scare me. I can't tell good from bad. 

I might delete this but I need to clear my head. You might ask yourself if i mistaken reddit for notepad. probabily. I don't know what I'm doing here.


I'm just a shell of what I was. What was once curiosity is now just static, ignoring everything that's outside of my body. I try to follow your words. I try to understand. I am tired. No one sees it. Nobody cares. I can't pull myself out. The advice I used to give turned to passive agresiveness and criticism. It's not my fault please understand. My love was meant to get the best flowers out of two seeds growing together. I became selfish. I still want the best for you but there's nothing good left in me. I want you to enjoy life. Can you even do it with me? Does wanting you closer make me selfish? I treated you so badly lately and I'm so painfuly sorry. I can't stop it. I'm scared to take meds. What if they kill me. I'm really paranoid. I need help. Who would help someone as evil as me. someone please force me into treatment if you love me so much. How do I know if the treatment will work. I'm going crazy. 


This is not who I am... or is it who I am now? 

I'm scared.

edit:a bad word I wanted to remove :'D"
I feel like I'm being replaced again and it hurts so much.,"We used to hang out and talk all the time, now it takes weeks for my friend to message me back, and it's almost always a one or two word response. My friend doesn't hang out with me anymore, they hang out with someone else now. I feel like I'm slowly being forgotten. This has happened to me before, so I was sort of expecting it to happen Again, but it still hurts so much. I don't want to go through this again."
Pulling myself out of the pit...at least for a bit,"I felt lighter today mentally. I love these days. After a long depressive cycle I am finally pulling myself out of the deep dark pit of depression. The last few weeks have been torture in my own head. I am not suicidal, but I was spending a lot of time wishing I would die naturally. Some quick accident that would end the pain. 

And then days like today remind me to appreciate the little things. Nothing astounding happened today, and I don‚Äôt know what switch flipped and made me feel a little less sad. But I‚Äôm so glad it did. 

I‚Äôve gone through these cycles as long as I can remember. A deep dark depression followed by a remission of sorts. My depression and anxiety stays with me but I feel stronger and can keep it at bay.      ......Until I can‚Äôt..... And then I‚Äôm back in the fucked up mindset thinking that I am a piece of shit and want to die.

But today I enjoyed my life. And I hope some of you did too. If you didn‚Äôt...just know a good day is coming. They always do. "
My problems are ruining my relationships. (I‚Äôve also realized that I really don‚Äôt like myself.),"Like a month ago I‚Äôve met a girl and we‚Äôve been texting every day since then.

She has a very good influence on me. 
My problems (stress, sadness, anxiety etc.) are getting easier to deal with thanks to her.

But feeling better naturally comes with worrying about losing this ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù... a lot...

I worry about losing her so much that it‚Äôs probably not having a very good impact on our relationship...


Even though I feel better that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm totally fine.

I still get these waves of [insert any of my problems here].

We very often argue when this happens.

I‚Äôm extremly worried that this will end up ruining my relationship with her.

She will not like me anymore if I keep having these waves...


Yesterday we were talking and she brought up how I have very low self-esteem. 

She wanted to help so she recommended something that has helped her with her self-esteem issues.

Go to a mirror and say ‚ÄúI love myself.‚Äù

I was almost unable to do this... I mean- I said it but I didn‚Äôt belive it and it made me feel way worse because I didn‚Äôt think it was THIS BAD...

Then I realized how much I don‚Äôt like myself...

I‚Äôve felt like shit because of that since yesterday. (It‚Äôs getting better today, thankfully.)


She probably isn‚Äôt too happy about having to deal with me in these situations...


I‚Äôm not sure what to do... I really don‚Äôt want to lose her because of this...

I hope someone has some good advice for this..."
Not knowing what I want my future to be is stressful and depressing,"I was asked a question the other day and I didn't have an answer and it hit me like a sack of rocks. I've always felt depressed since my dad passed away in 2006 but it's hit me hard lately and I don't know why. I'm recently married, my wife just had my son, have a great paying job that's just like every other job, and a loving family, and I still feel unaccomplished, lonely, and not awake in the world. My future is a dim lit room full of doors I can't see and quite frankly, im afraid to open them. I need help...


EDIT: The question was what is your 3-5 year plan."
I don‚Äôt know. I just feel like saying it here that I‚Äôm deeply and secretly sad and lonely.,I just wanna fly away but I can‚Äôt seem to collect my thoughts. What things make you happy?
Anyone else feel like their head is going to explode.,"It feels like a million thoughts are racing through my mind and I hate it. I want to scream, I want bash my head into something. Not to cause pain, but to stop thinking. What am I supposed to do in theses situations?"
"Don‚Äôt want to be annoying, but I miss my best friend","About 2 months ago, my best friend stopped talking to me. There was a situation at work where I was more abrupt than I should have been and I know I hurt his feelings. I apologized the very next day. At the same time, we both went through major life crises. I did my best to support him but it felt like my entire life was falling apart again, and I spiralled back into depression again. 

I know he will never apologize for the things he said to me or how he hurt me. I also know that he has never been one to initiate a conversation. But I miss him so much that I‚Äôve been physically sick now for two weeks. Along with the whole pandemic situation, I have never felt more alone. He‚Äôs made it very clear that he needs space to deal, but I need to talk. 

It‚Äôs getting bad. I can‚Äôt sleep. I keep throwing up. If he‚Äôs going to hate me for one mistake I made, I know I should just move on. But I can‚Äôt. What do I do?"
I'm Sick of fighting for myself,I'm in a psychiatry since a few weeks because I am suicidal and i really need someone worth fighting for. There's nothing left that I'd want to achieve for myself and the ones eho were close to me have left me.
Im losing it all because money troubles," Im recovering from being on a massive suicide  watch from last year still going to weekly therapy and psych  alot too. Now i decided to take a semester off of college  my dad insists im never going to college  now cause of  it, my dad requests i work full time i oblige and work two jobs help with groceries and chores.  My dad asks for 70%percent of what i make, i said i cant cause i dont have a drivers license  and use ubers for getting to work which is 16 dollars a day(in a disability  program for it)   i said how  about  40% and the other 10% goes into college  savings i was told no. So flash forward to now im having trouble paying rent to my father cause i cant afford it, (note i have a twin and hes missed only one less payment than me and  he isnt being treated like this) so  i get woken up with a text telling me my dads shipping my off to help my emotionally abusive and sometimes physical abusive grandmother, i say no. Cause i dont want to miss out on my therapy and college. He points out how shitty i am,  he than tells me how cause my  i washed my hair in his shower im awful. I stated  my sister got  rent free for a year and only spent the same amount of grocery as i do. You also let her friend stay here rent free for 2 years, and my mothers friend for one, why dont i get that  i didn't even graduate Year ago. They were silent and than complained more about me and now im laying in my bed debating whether  i should keep living cause i cant afford life. The stock market crashed effecting my job i have to pay 300 and  ive only made 200 a month till recently. I wish i was dead i admitted what i did wrong to my family and apologized ( it was small shit like forgetting to lock the door after a friend left it open.)"
I don't know if I am depressed or just have a severe burnout,"For about 7 years now I feel terrible, but it comes and goes. I have periods where I just want to stop existing and after some time I have the feeling that everything is fine. 
I spoke to my doctor about it (a few days ago for the first time) and she believes that its just a burnout. I have panick attacks when school, work or life in general gets overwhelming, so I get where she is coming from.
But does that mean that this feeling that I just want to stop existing and that life is pointless comes from a burnout? She asked if I ever wanted to hurt myself and I said no because I've seen firsthand what it can do to people (family/friends). She said that it probably isn't a depression because of that. Is the feeling of a burnout similar to a depression? How do you know the difference?"
Can I just chat with someone?,"First off, I‚Äôm not suicidal or anything like that, I just get bouts of random-ass depression and this is one of those times. None of my friends are people I can just approach with this stuff, but it‚Äôs tearing me up to not be able to talk to someone."
I feel like ending it but then I just feel to lazy too like I wish someone else would do it for me,"So this is another of my accounts as I'd like nobody I know to know but I just don't want to be here at all (female/teen) it just doesn't feel right being here I have no purpose and serve no use to anyone but when I want to end it I'm also really tired and just too lazy to actually do it, I wish I could be uthanized thank you for reading about my pathetic ass "
This is me finally talking about ‚Äúit‚Äù.,"I do not have depression, my husband does. He has depression, but we don‚Äôt use that word. We say ‚Äúdark days‚Äù and on those days his mood is self-described as ‚Äúblah‚Äù. He has depression, but we don‚Äôt talk about it.       
It‚Äôs not for lack of trying on my part. I wish he could open up and tell me how he‚Äôs feeling. I wish he could cry with me and tell me that we‚Äôll get through this as much as I tell him. My husband has depression, but we don‚Äôt tell anyone about it. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your husband?‚Äù Is the hardest question to hear sometimes. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt your husband come?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt feeling well‚Äù, I say. ‚ÄúWe decided he needed to get some rest.‚Äù We don‚Äôt talk about it. It is dark. It is a cloud that hangs over our house for weeks. Sometimes, it  isn‚Äôt so bad. We have good days. We even have great months. Beautiful months. But it rears it‚Äôs ugly head and we know. We know because the house feels tight. The rooms when we‚Äôre together feel as though they are squeezing in. It doesn‚Äôt care that I need to be touched, or that I need to touch my husband. We don‚Äôt talk about it. But we do fight through. We stand back to back. Sometimes, I have to support both of us with my broken emotions and iron love, and that‚Äôs okay. I know he realizes all of this, I know because in those good days and great months, I‚Äôm treated as a queen. We make love and make memories and we shine. We shine so bright that I know when the dark days come, we‚Äôll fight them. He knows he has me somewhere in those dark, cold days, even if he can‚Äôt see or hear me, he knows I‚Äôm there. And I know that he‚Äôs there, too, still the man I love, the hero of my fairytale. 
The hardest part though, the part that I wish we could change (because depression isn‚Äôt something that can just be fixed, I know this); my husband has depression, but we don‚Äôt talk about it.  "
Rode a huge wave of happiness for a couple months. God damn the crash is hard,"Made some good memories I guess. But fuck this dude, what's the point of even trying to get happy of I'm just going to fee 10x worse than before "
Keeping your living space clean,"Does anyone else struggle greatly with keeping your apartment/house clean, especially in a low mental place? When I‚Äôm more depressed my dishes build up, I run out of laundry and everything goes to shit. I feel better and I‚Äôll clean one room, but then it takes over again  and I can never seem to keep up. If I leave my clothes laying around my cats pee on them and now I‚Äôm left with like four bags of clothing covered in cat pee and I don‚Äôt know where to begin and what to do with it. I‚Äôm so overwhelmed, any time I do clean I avoid dealing with the cat pee clothes. It‚Äôs so disgusting and I just keep ignoring it :/"
too much for too many people,"hi,   does anyone else find that when they try to reach out, to anyone, from therapist to people you want a relationship with, to even just random internet strangers,  you always end up being too much,   to broken, to depressed, to nerdy etc for them to want to keep talking to you,   so you spend years of your life pretending like you live a shallow existence so you dont seem to be too much for too many people and it just leads you to be cold and alone with no one knowing who you really are and craving real human contact for someone whom im not some case study for or a good deed of the day to listen to.       is it just me who craves actual human contact or have i finally gone mad"
It's 4:37pm and I've been laying in bed all day crying,"I can't seem to get up to do anything. I got up oncw to take a bath (which is my go to thing I do when I'm depressed) and once to eat food, which I had to talk myself into doing for 30 minutes. I just need help. Tips, tricks, anything really. I'm desperate. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who helped me! It made me feel that I was less alone. I love this community!"
"I need someone, anyone to talk to.","I‚Äôm in one of the darkest moments of my life and I don‚Äôt have anyone to turn to. I‚Äôd appreciate anyone to listen to what I have to say. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do.

Edit: I‚Äôm absolutely blown away with the support I‚Äôve received from this post. I never thought it would get to much attention. Thank you to everyone who reached out, i feel like I can hold on another day now:)"
Anything. I just need something to get me to the end of this 10+ hour shift.,"All week I have been depressed at some point. For a while I was able to take this meaningless life of never ending work, but after 2 months of my boss working as many 12 hour days as he could to pay for his weeding, I can't keep my depression aways anymore. 

Please some kind of help, something. I know that nothing is free, but I just need something beyond promises of hope or things will get better.

Edit: I'm finally home after popping a tire in a pothole (was outside the office and able to use the tools there) and got something to eat. I don't really feel any better, but at least I'm off work for 2 days. I can't hide the thread, but I'm not really in the mood to talk about my hopeless life."
Why I always feel alone?,"I have my family but they always feel me that im a strong independent woman that i can solve everything in my own way. Im tired doing things. Im tired of being feeling strong. I always hide my feelings to everyone. I always kept feelings inside me now, it feels like my heart will bomb anytime."
I feel extreamly unmotivated to go on with life,"I see no point to this. I don't want to continue. I don't think I'm depressed or anything, but if I was given the option to never have existed I would take it. I never asked for life and I don't think I want it. The only thing keeping me going I suppose is the trauma I would inflict if people found my body in my apartment. Besides that my parents spent a lot of money on my education and without me to provide for them when I finish they may end up in poverty. I'm trying to do better but some things just seem to be taking me 10 steps back the moment I try harder. I think I'm growing number to life. I have a final tomorfow and I don't care."
I‚Äôm 14 and I think I wanna die,"....idk how to start this. 
I guess it‚Äôs not as important as everyone else‚Äôs stuff but I need to get it off my chest. 
 
Hi. My name is Rashaun. I‚Äôm 14 and I think I want to die.

I don‚Äôt feel like I should be here. Growing up all of my siblings had always told me that I was a mistake. That they didn‚Äôt love me, or that they didn‚Äôt want me around. I always thought it was normal.... but then I met him. My best friend.... At least I thought he was. 

His family was different. I realised this when his mum didn‚Äôt hit him like mine hit me. Or how he had a good relationship with his siblings. They were nice. And so I stayed. I was at their house almost every day. I‚Äôd beg to sleep overnight. I‚Äôd beg to just stay with them. This went on from the age of 7- 12... everything was good...But then I realised that I liked him.

 I liked him more than I should have and I knew that he‚Äôd think I was weird. He‚Äôd think I was a freak. But I told him anyway. I know I‚Äôm stupid but I really should have seen it coming that time. 

I wish I hadn‚Äôt told him. Maybe we‚Äôd still be friends. Maybe I‚Äôd have become ‚Äòpart of the family‚Äô but no. I had to open my mouth and tell him in my stupid little voice that I was gay. Stupid me...why...no how could he ever love me?  I‚Äôm just a weird kid with no future.

Out of all of my siblings the one I envy the most is my older brother. He isn‚Äôt the oldest though. I‚Äôm one of nine kids. He‚Äôs number 4 and I‚Äôm number 5. Only 2 years apart in age. 

He is like me. We look the same, sound the same and even dress the same..... but everyone treats him like a saint. Meanwhile I‚Äôm shoved into a corner. A mere shadow of by brother, who is always reminding me who I could never be.

I started cutting at a young age.  I was 13 when he had finally noticed. And you know what he said... ‚Äòdo me a favour and cut deeper. ‚Äò ......yeh. Ok... I never did cut deeper. I‚Äôm such a scaredy-cat. 

I‚Äôd I could do it then I would. Die I mean. I read in a book once that  ‚Äòpeople think the word scuicidal means that somebody wants to kill them self‚Äôs and they aren‚Äôt afraid to do it.  But it‚Äôs actually the opposite. They don‚Äôt want to die and they are scared...but they feel like there‚Äôs no other option‚Äò.

I‚Äôve thougt about it. Every now and then I get a random thought about jumping in front of a car on the way home from school. Of how when I‚Äôm in the bath I should drown myself. Or how I should hang myself with the rope I found in the woods and took home just in case. 

But I‚Äôm scared. And I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs stopping me. That‚Äôs all. Even if you don‚Äôt reply. Thanks for reading I guess 

Yours sincerely 
Rashaun"
It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not allowed to feel this way,"Recently, my depression symptoms have been worse. My mom brought me to the doctor and because I‚Äôm too afraid to open up, my trash doctor thinks I‚Äôm faking so he told me to smile more and think positive. Now my father thinks like my doctor and every time I‚Äôm feeling down, he becomes angry at me for feeling that way when I can‚Äôt help it. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not allowed to be depressed. Nobody understands my pain. But I understand because I never fully opened up. Any advice for handling my situation?"
please dont get mad. i need help/advice,"hello. i hope this doesn't rub off people the wrong way or come off as a trigger to people. 

anyone here who lost their mom/dad to suicide? And how hasnit affected you while growing up? 

i'm asking because lately i've been having an intense desire to hang myself outside. i have a two year old beautiful loving son but even seeing his face doesn't make these thoughts go away. i even think it's for the best if i'm gone, he'll be better off with his dad. i just have this feeling that they'd all be relieved if i'm dead"
I pushed my friends away,"They noticed I had been down lately, it's not rare but it's taking me alot longer to recover than before. They tried to ask me and see if I was okay and I kept saying that I'm fine and they should not waste their time on me. I now realize how much of an ass I am, how do I apologize?"
I really dislike positivism as a way to try to help me with my depression.,"I meant to say positive thinking because positivism is a philosophical concept. My bad.

I may be a cynic and that's why but I do feel like, instead of helping, positive thinking makes me feel like an incompetent person, like I'm being talked down by the superior other that is going to come down to tell me the universal answers. It sounds like the one doing the positive talk is patronizing me. Is not that I'm the one who has ""low self esteem"", it definitely sounds like you are the one with ""superior complex"" and or humble brag. *""It's so easy to to be happy, just do what I do, it worked wonders for me, how can you not be happy with what you have? I care about you, you are so strong (smiley face thumbs up  heart kitty)""*. Ugh... It's like baby talk. It's condescending.

I would prefer to talk without pink filters. Trying to think that *""everything will be ok""*, *""don't worry, you have people that loves you""*. No, it won't be ok, it will suck ass and i will have to confront it one way or another anyways and trying to color it doesn't help me prepare for it. I prefer to grab that sadness and anger and use it in a productive way instead of trying to cover my eyes and go to my happy place ignoring and avoiding everything that I cannot change thinking that tomorrow will be a happier day, watching the beauty of the world around me. That only works so much and doesn't solve anything. 

Sometimes saying ""you know what, yeah, it fucking sucks and there might not be a solution to it"" it's much better because I can stop focusing on it and start trying other things. Sometimes a smack on the face on someone that is being a dick to you is what is needed to stop certain situations. Let me lash out at the world and let others know that something might be wrong with it and it won't get better unless it changes too.

I would prefer not avoid not to hurt the other with my words or my supposed toxic behavior because I can't see the bright side, censoring myself and what I actually think every five minutes to try to keep things going and make the other not feel offended.

All I'm saying is I hate positive thinking. It's useless for me."
What do I do when I feel like I'm not getting any better?,"Lately I've been having a depressive episode. I've been getting help for the past 4 years or so, I thought I had found a medication set to help control things a little better, my therapist seems helpful, but I honestly feel like everything is only a temporary fix and that I'm not actually getting better despite taking every step I can think of to work towards feeling better."
Depression anger,"My depression and anxiety causes me to get angry often. I am not a violent person but these situations leave me with the feeling of wanting to hit or break something (only things, never people). Only there is nothing around that I could damage without causing further problems. Does this happen to anyone else? How do I handle this? It is happening more and more often?"
Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation?," Hey, before depression took over my life I\[23F\] used to be such a happy person - joyful, positive, hyped about all kinds of activities, passionate about life. Before finishing college I used to think that lack of time is my only problem, I had so many plans and wishes and I used to think that depression isn't a real thing, that some people just choose to be unhappy. And then it hit me - repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression.

At first I thought it's only a bad phase and I was expecting it to end soon since I was about to start my summer vacations. I had planned a 2 weeks trip to Scotland and I was really hyped about it for like 6 months before leaving, but somehow I couldn't enjoy it, I only wanted to sleep and be alone and I was struggling to get through each day without being rude or visibly irritated by everything was going on around me. That's when I realized that ""bad phase"" was a special one, but I only decided to get specialized help when I was already 4 months deep into it. At that point I was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. At that moment, one of my best friends told me I was only a shadow of the person I used to be. The best feeling I was able to get about anything was ""this is almost acceptable"".

After my first visit to the psychiatrist I was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me - Christmas was coming and I started WANTING TO DO STUFF AWAKE!! I started watching netflix again, playing video games, hanging out with friends. I was still sad mostly, but I was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasn't even mad about it. I mean, I cried because crying was like my main occupation (along with sleeping) and because I knew that's what I'm supposed to do when I get fired but I didn't really feel much about that event. In January I went in a trip to New York with one of my best friends and I enjoyed every moment of it! Then I came home and started looking for a new job. I was so relaxed and carefree and I was becoming my old self again. In February I started a new job and shortly after that I stopped my antidepressants treatment.

But I feel like **this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete**. Sometimes I get close to what I used to be before this whole thing but I can't sustain that, like the old-happy-me is visiting sometimes but she doesn't wanna stay. Even though things go great for me now (great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship) I am mostly anxious and scared. I can't be genuinely happy with the good things I have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. I heard things like ""you'll never go back to what you used to be before depression"", ""depression leaves a scar you'll have to live with your entire life"", ""depression is a part of growing up, you just can't go back"". I am starting to believe these things and it's sad. Are they true? I have no chance to going back to my old self?"
The day I got a zero.,"I am having my semester exchange now in Korea and received my quiz results that I took 3 weeks ago. I got a flat zero. Not even a chance was given to me.

I knew I was fucked when I was doing the paper because none of the things I studied came out. I studied wronly by just trying to remember the theory but I didn't find the practise questions to practise.

Turned out I couldn't do a single question out of the 3 questions. I tried to write whatever I know hoping to get some makes but not a single chance was given. Flat zero.

I am a hard worker because I am not smart. Things like this really makes me feel like giving up at times. I know I should have studied smarter. It was really a messed up part on my revision.

I am having my midterms next week and i know its a chance for me to make it right again. But I am so tired. I have a total of 7 exams to take within 3 days.

At this point of time I'm just sad and tired. But I still have to study. That's my life right."
Fighting the Beast,I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years.  Ever since I was raped when I was 8.  I've been told that I'm bipolar.  The only thing that saved me from committing suicide was music.  I made this video last year that really spoke about some of the demons I was fighting using a Gorilla as my body and face to represent the beast.  I've been ashamed to share these things in the past but I think I have a responsibility as a musician to be honest about everything I go through.  Here is the YouTube link if you want to check it out [https://youtu.be/DENs8PRR4Vk](https://youtu.be/DENs8PRR4Vk)
I just...,I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I can‚Äôt stand this feeling. I can‚Äôt stand second guessing every valid relationship I have and everyone who cares about me. I can‚Äôt stand feeling like I‚Äôm just a burden to people who have their own problems. I just... can‚Äôt do this anymore. 
I have been severely depressed and it is affecting my school work and looking for advice,"Since I've hit my 20's, my depression has just plummeted. In high school, I hadn't been diagnosed yet with my anxiety and depression, and even though it was present it didn't feel nearly as bad as this. I hit my 20's, now 23 yrs old, and I am having constant depression cycles. The cycles are becoming more frequent and each time it feels harder to come out of. As of lately I have been probably the most down that I have felt to date. I am in my sophomore year of college as a bio major. I haven't been keeping up with classes, I have been failing exams and I don't have nearly enough credits to keep my scholarship for my junior year. I have fucked myself so badly with school I don't know what to do. I want so badly to take a leave of absence to get myself together, up my medication and see a therapist. I really want to get better. However, if I take a leave from school I will lose all financial aid for my junior year as well. My fianc√© and I are pretty financially responsible people and have budgeted out for the next year and a half based on the financial aid we both receive. It is not an option to lose that money or we will be completely fucked. I am asking advice on what to do. I need to take a break from school or I will just keep digging myself deeper into this GPA and depression nightmare, but we also can't lose any money from it. I do want to reenroll for the fall semester, but I just need a break now. I am lost. Any advice would be so helpful."
Burnout is on the rise in society. And science says the solution isn't simply to work fewer hours. It's much more complicated (and introspective).,[https://psychologycompass.com/blog/preventing-work-burnout/](https://psychologycompass.com/blog/preventing-work-burnout/)
my boyfriend deserves something better,"about 5 months ago i fell in love with this beautiful, fun and cute guy. and somehow he felt the same for me. 

im ugly, depressed, im not good at anything, my body isnt that great, i have random mental breakdowns at least 1 day per week. I know that several guys way better than me have asked him to date them, but he was already with me when it happened so he said no. Plus, we are a long distance relationship so i cant even give him fisical contact. 

And I cant stop thinking how much happier he would be if he chose any of the other guys that want to be with him. They all are more pretty, succesful and funny than me.

i dont know. he deserves better than me

sorry for broken english"
Has anyone else struggled with post-graduation depression?,"After 6 grueling and mentally taxing years I finally graduated college a few weeks ago. While I am proud of myself, I don't feel as good as I thought I would. I didn't expect my depression/anxiety to be magically lifted, but I did expect it to get slighter better. Honestly, it's gotten much worse. After graduating with a degree I wasn't 100% sure of and an unfavorable internship in my area of study I feel hopeless (I have a part-time job, but it's certainly not my career path and is unreliable due to the pandemic). I feel I have no career path and that I'll be stuck in this cycle forever.

I don't know my direction in life and I don't even know how to find one. I can't picture myself happily in any career path. Even job searching online causes immense panic attacks. The thought of interviewing for a job makes me physically ill. 

My friends (most of whom graduated on time years before me) have already started their careers and I feel like I'm stuck in the mud...unable to lift my feet off the ground. It takes a lot for me to get out of bed and I feel my family is disappointed in me. I fear my friends think I'm lazy and unmotivated but I'd feel silly telling them how I feel at this moment. It's gotten to the point where I avoid dating (pre-pandemic, I have been following social distancing guidelines) because I feel like a failure when I tell people I don't know what I want to do. I even avoid talking to family members because I dread the career questions and I feel it's strained some of my relationships.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? (Edited for spelling errors)"
Relationship possibly costing me my mental health,"Hopefully I don't go too long with ranting and what not so I'll try to keep it short. My GF and I have been in an on/off relationship for 7 years and have been together since highschool. [25M/24F]. Last summer she broke up with me over because she wanted to experience other things which she didn't come up front and said that I just figured. It was an extremely rough month for me after that but slowly got over it. Few months later Over the holidays she decides to try and come back into my life. I tried not to sleep with her for a bit since I knew that's what she wanted at first. Now we're back together but I found out that she slept with what was a close friend over the break up. She also was dating someone off tinder for majority of the break up and all of this is just really fucking me up. I really love this girl and I am trying to move forward since she claims that she loves me and wants to have a future with me. I want all of that as well, it's only been a month since we're trying to work things out again but there are days like these where I don't know if I could let this go. I want to so bad and recently I've been losing myself over this whole situation. I don't know who I am anymore. I feel so many emotions when I get caught up thinking about all the shit she did during the break up. Anyone have any suggestions or advice on this? Please. All is appreciated. (I would go to a relationships subreddit but I'm afraid of negative feedback given there and I'm feeling like I'm legitimately depressed)"
How can i forgive myself?,"I hate myself and i can‚Äôt forgive myself for what i‚Äôve done! I was so depressed and i broke up with my bf after 4 years we were literally 24/7 together.. i can‚Äôt forgive myself for the damage that i caused to him, i broke his heart, he‚Äôs insecure about everything because of me, i want him back to fix what i‚Äôve broke but he refused, he‚Äôs afraid of everything.. i made terrible mistakes, i wasn‚Äôt mature enough and i was acting really stupid, i used to control everything, and say if you did that i‚Äôll leave, like if you smoke or drink or whatever, i used to hate smoking because i hate my father and he‚Äôs a smoker, i wasn‚Äôt admitting that and i used to say that i just hate smoking without saying any reasons, and all sudden i start to smoke to threat him that i‚Äôll never stop till he stops i know i was doing the wrong thing but i was depressed and i didn‚Äôt understand what i was doing, i attempt suicide and i told him its because of you and you‚Äôre not a good person although i loved him so much, and still. Idk i was just worry i didn‚Äôt want him to hurt him self or smoke or whatever, i used to send him big long text saying how much he made me hate my life and i‚Äôm smoking because of him and doing everything bad and depressed because of him, i used to hurt him, all that was in the last 6 month, we had a 3 years full of happiness and good memories, everything happened was in the last 6 month, we broke up 4 month ago.. i tried to talk to him but said its over and i still can‚Äôt believe that we broke up i can‚Äôt stop thinking about him, our memories everywhere, what  can i do to make him forgive and come back? I only thing i know that he still in love with me and he didn‚Äôt get over it but he‚Äôs afraid .. i feel like i‚Äôm such a monster and i really want to fix everything, i‚Äôm his first love and he‚Äôs my first love too so its really hard to get over it, i feel like 4 years is worth one more chance? After we broke up i travelled to another country and stayed alone for 3 months, in this period i‚Äôve changed into a good person, and i finally felt that i‚Äôm mature enough to take care of him and be in a healthy relationship. I loved him so much that i was acting as i‚Äôm his mom not his gf, saying no to everything he want and saying that i care about you and don‚Äôt do thaaaaaat and i used to force me to do what i want and if say no i used to threat him that i‚Äôll hurt myself if he did it.. BUT I HAVE CHANGED NOW I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING AND I WON‚ÄôT EVER DO WHAT I WAS DOING .. i wish he could give me another chance to be the right gf that we make things together and have fun together not his mom who say no to everything .. I quit smoking for 50 days and i got a vape to quit, now i‚Äôm smoking again but because i wanted to! I mean the first time i smoked just to make him feel bad about it now i took the decision cause i want to, i feel like i‚Äôm mature enough to do whatever i want to, i got over hating smoking, i drink once a week just to have fun and laugh a lot and forget about whats happening in my life, i happy with my new life but still want him to be a part of it and i know he thought that i‚Äôm drinking&smoking because of him again and he will never understand cause we‚Äôre not talking to each other anymore ..  Idkkkk what should l do? Should i try to talk to him again? And see him? I tried once but i was far away and i just texted him saying that i‚Äôve changed but he didn‚Äôt believe that i have changed, what should i do?  HELP ME PLEASE"
Reminded that I'm a failure,"I've dropped out of college this year due to severe depression as well as family and financial issues currently going on. My friends are graduating this weekend and I would have been graduating with them as well. 

I'm so proud of them, and I feel so selfish feeling this way, but at the same time seeing how ecstatic and joyful their family is and seeing them get their degrees just reminds me I was never good enough to make it to the end like them. Even if I did graduate, no one from my family would probably have gone. My own parents have never told me they were ever proud of me growing up, not once. If anything they only reminded me of my failures.

The majority of my depression is caused from growing up in extreme poverty and an unstable household with brothers abusing drugs, abusive parents, neglect, and childhood trauma. I went to a private University and none of my friends or anyone I knew even remotely experienced anything like that. 

Sometimes I get frustrated that a big reason why I couldn't graduate was because of the baggage and instability from my childhood that more privileged people graduating at my school didn't have to deal with. But I guess that's just life, it's not fair.

Anyways, thank you for reading a little bit of my story."
How to help my girlfriend with severe depression?,"My (19M) girlfriend (19F) of one and a half years has struggled with varying severities of depression throughout her life but recently it has become very difficult for her. Unfortunately, due to a heart condition she is unable to take certain medication including antidepressants. Additionally, her parents are fairly dismissive of mental illness, and even if she were able to take medication her parents would disapprove. Obviously this makes treating her depression very hard and I can‚Äôt stand watching her struggle. Over the last month she said she just feels so alone and frequently thinks about suicide or self harm. If anyone in similar situations or otherwise has any suggestions for ways I could help her get through this trying time I would be very grateful. Activites, date ideas, or just ways I should compose myself would be greatly appreciated."
"Ugly people, how do y'all deal with it?","So I'm pretty ugly tbh, I would rate myself as a 3-4, body wise I have a nice body, starting to lose it though because I haven't worked out in a couple months, but even though I have a nice body, my face is full of acne scars and I'm going bald and I'm not even 25 yet.
Sometimes I don't even want to go outside because I feel like I'm too ugly, but that's honestly only when I'm feeling down.
The biggest problem for me is finding affection, I understand that I'm not attractive, so I don't expect the girl to be that pretty, but honestly I don't get any form of affection, and the little attention I get is from girls who are not even slightly attractive (I know talking like this, makes it seem like I'm a horrible person, but honestly idk how else to say it). 
Honestly, my mom is the only person that shows me any kind of affection, and it makes me just want to be at home all the time, even though I have friends, they are not really people who I can depend on. Sometimes I just want to start getting escorts or something to spend my time with, but I know I'll feel even more depressed if I go down that route."
I‚Äôm struggling to find a reason.,"I don‚Äôt see any point in staying. What stopped you?

Edit: hey guys I‚Äôm so thankful for your replies. I contacted my psychologist who directed me to  a free group therapy program and my boss has agreed to allow me to take time off work every week to participate. 

I really feel like this will help and perhaps bring purpose into my life. I am still feeling very low and have intent however your ideas and perspective has been taken on board. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Advice to stop doing nothing?,"I‚Äôve been really struggling these past few weeks to do anything at all, I get out of bed, sit around all day, sometimes eat some sugary snacks, and go back to sleep as soon as I can.. it‚Äôs just making me angry at myself at this point but I don‚Äôt know how to break the cycle/get motivation to do anything at all

(I‚Äôm 20 and a full time student (not a very good one at all) if anyone wants context)"
Epiphany...,"Let‚Äôs see if I can explain this. I feel sad, I feel guilty or abnormal for feeling sad and then I spiral. I feel tired, I want to nap, I beat myself up for feeling this way and call myself lazy, etc. and spiral downwards. I‚Äôve decided to eliminate all the judgement on myself for feeling the way I do. So I feel sad, it‚Äôs ok to feel sad- I‚Äôll do something that usually distracts me or makes me feel better and eventually that feeling goes away. I want to nap- fine I‚Äôll take a nap- eventually after an hour I feel rested and move on with my day. Typically, I go back in forth about whether or not I should take a nap, judging myself for wanting to nap and wishing I had more energy or could power through my day like all my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù friends. This turns into laying in bed for an hour spiraling into utter exhaustion so that I have to take a two hour nap just to recover. Anyone understand the spiraling and mental exhaustion that comes with judging yourself negatively for every feeling, thought, etc you have? I‚Äôm done with it! "
My Twin Sister Wants To Take My Life Away From Me Including My Dream,"I have a dream that one day i'll get married with a man that will appreciate me for who I am and what I'll be thinking; and accept me for who I am. 

Anyways, My twin sister thinks I'm lesbian, gay would do bad, etc. 

She wants to put me away because she thinks I'm not fit for my own well-being for acting like a child. When I don't know how to handle pain, and don't like it when people are controlling towards me. I'm afraid of my sister trying to control my life and how I should act. She wants to get rid of me. Because She thinks I'm a weird crazy person. Yet I have Autism and I have depression and bipolar.

I'm depressed because of my twin sister always wanting to get rid of me because she don't like how calm and normal I am for being a person. 

I want to be accepted for who I am.

I dream about love and my family thinks its not normal for me to come out clean and say, ''I want my fairytale dream to come true'' But my sister wants to take away my dream, my life, my stuff, and put me away, before I know it I could be thrown to hell. x.x"
I‚Äôm lonely and depressed,"So I was off on a youth volunteer program, located across the country.  We would have been traveling to a second place, which didn‚Äôt happen.  I was in a house with 10 youth from around Canada, who started off as strangers.  We were living together for 2 1/2 months before we were sent home, which was halfway through the programme.

I met some of my best friends.  We have plans in over a year to do a road trip across the country.  But I won‚Äôt see them until then, as we live so far apart from each other.  I loved the time we all had together.  There were ups and downs, but I got a lot from the experience.  I‚Äôm generally quite shy, so it was amazing to be surrounded by people, socializing 24/7.  I definitely came out of my shell.  We would stay up late, and all sleep in the same room.  We would wake up, and have breakfast together.  Anytime I felt like going out for a walk, I always had friends around to join me.  We smoked weed many nights together, watched movies, and made food late at night.  It was what I always felt like I was missing, not having any siblings who I had this relationship with.  Anytime I was feeling a bit off, my friends were there to talk to me about it.

Also, I was independent.  I could do what I wanted and be who I wanted to be.  I wasn‚Äôt being told by my parents how to behave, or being judged by a group of friends from home who I act a certain way around.  I came into the programme as myself, and only myself.  I didn‚Äôt have to act a certain way to fit in with a group of friends, or act a certain way at home to please my parents.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my parents.  But I‚Äôm at the time of my life (17M, btw) where I want that freedom.  I want to explore who I can be.

We were supposed to travel other places, and fly to a different part of the country to spend the second half of the trip.  Then we got quarantined.  Then we were sent home.  My friend and I who happened to be on two flights took some edibles before.  We had to leave at 3:30, so we didn‚Äôt bother sleeping before we went to the airport.  These edibles hit HARD.  Once I got to the gate we‚Äôd be waiting at, I was paranoid.  There was people around.  These people might have COVID-19.  The seat I‚Äôm sitting on might have COVID-19.  I couldn‚Äôt escape it.  It was everywhere.  Whenever I heard someone cough, it felt like an impending bioweapon.  But I was trapped in this airport and couldn‚Äôt avoid it.  I had a mini-panic attack in the washroom.  

I got on the flight, and it was surreal.  I hasn‚Äôt really processed things yet.  But I started to drift off to sleep, and saw myself at the house we were staying, with everyone in my volunteer group around.  Then I woke up.  And the whole world came rushing into me.  I was on a flight.  I was leaving.  I was going home.  I might not see some of those people ever again.  My volunteer program experience was now in the past, and I couldn‚Äôt change that.  I wanted to cry.  It‚Äôs not like I even really LIKED everyone in my group.  But after spending almost three months living with them, I was still attached to them.  And it was hard to leave that behind.

After a blurry ~14 hours, I finally got to my home airport.  My parents met me there and picked me up.  I told them how things went, but it‚Äôs impossible to really communicate my experience.  I got home, but realized I wasn‚Äôt really home.  Things were different.  Society has morphed into a nightmare-like dystopia.  I‚Äôm not even allowed to see all my friends.  How has the world changed so quickly?

I was able to go out and see two of my friends.  We played basketball, and it was pretty fun.  I told them about how my trip was, and shared a few stories.  But it was weird.  These used to be who ‚Äúmy friends‚Äù were.  They‚Äôre still some of my best friends, of course, but now I have OTHER friends, who I consider to be almost as close.  And with these other friends, I have plans in the future to go on a road trip across the country with.  It‚Äôs weird knowing that I know have other close friends, who my best friends don‚Äôt even know.  And it was weird coming back home, seeing my friends, and knowing that I don‚Äôt even want to be here.  I want to be back with my youth volunteer group.  My friends were really happy I was back, but I can‚Äôt possibly feel the same way under these circumstances.  I‚Äôm NOT happy to be back.  I don‚Äôt WANT to be here.  My life is so depressing now.

Almost every moment since I‚Äôve been back, I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve suffered.  Sometimes, for brief moments, something has made me feel happy.  And I‚Äôve felt content for that moment.  But then I remember my current situation, and it feels like a pang to my stomach.  I feel like I can‚Äôt escape this world of misery.  I know that COVID-19 will blow over, I‚Äôll have a good summer with my friends here.  And next year, I‚Äôll go on a road trip with my good friends from the programme.  But right now I just feel empty.  What am I gonna do for the next few months?  I wasn‚Äôt even supposed to be here."
Advice for holding yourself accountable? I want to change but I'm not sure how to go about it.,"I've technically already posted this but I figured I'd try and ask once more.

What are some ways you held yourself accountable in regards to cleaning and self care and stuff like that? When I was really at my low I got to the point where all I would do was sleep so I didn't have to feel anything. I want/need to get out of that and back to the person who could actually get up and do things. It's not like I don't want to do them but I let the place get so bad it's so overwhelming to think about where to start and I just freeze. I'm pregnant so I've finally starting going to therapy because I want to be healthy not only for me now but for my future child. Me and my boyfriend are trying to move to be in a less stressful place but with the emotional ups and downs and pregnancy symptoms I've been totally useless. I want to contribute and not just sleep. I need to break these habits and become a better person."
How do I stay afloat and tend to my own demons when I‚Äôm in a marriage/love someone who is constantly depressed /sad.,"I love my wife, the mother of my beautiful daughter, so much. I knew when we met that she struggled with anxiety and depression, but it always seemed to be circumstantial most of the time. She would have her episodes, but would always seem to turn it around. When these times got dark, I was always there with her to reassure her that she wasn‚Äôt alone and that no matter how low she got, I‚Äôd be right there with her when she needed me. 

I also deal with my own depression and troubles, but always tried to be there for her and to be her rock, because her situation always seemed to be more important than whatever I had to deal with. In short, I sucked it up and put on a brave face to be there for her. It killed me on the inside, but when you love someone you tend to put their needs ahead of your own. 

Fast forward 3yrs and we are now married and have a beautiful, spirited 2 1/2yr old daughter. She is very successful at work and maintains friendships, but at the same time is in a very dark place. Nothing seems to make her happy any more. She is losing patience with our daughter more often, has negative perspectives towards anything, and is just plain sad all the time. She is constantly getting upset over little things that should be dismissed and directing blame on me and our daughter for a lot of her emotions. 

We have so much to be grateful for. Despite that, it‚Äôs always a struggle to feel it because of the negativity cast within our household. 
I‚Äôve been having a hard time lately trying to be a positive influence, and a shoulder to turn to. I‚Äôve been feeling sad too, but I feel like I can‚Äôt be because my wife and daughter need me to be there to help balance out all the negative energy. 

My wife recently told me she just wants to die. I don‚Äôt know what to do. As someone who is always on the verge of being sad, I don‚Äôt know how I can keep being strong when I‚Äôm in such a negative environment all the time. I don‚Äôt know how to feel. Angry, sad bc it‚Äôs the person I love saying that, guilty because I can‚Äôt/am exhausted to be what she needs me to be to help her. I don‚Äôt know how to handle this or what to do. 

Side note: she‚Äôs pretty much rejects every therapist we‚Äôve seen over the past year because she wants them to ‚Äúfix‚Äù her but can‚Äôt handle any advice that points out flaws in her behavior"
Loneliness is taking over me,"I never realized how much I rely on having human contact and connection. I recently went through my first heartbreak and I lost a best friend and I‚Äôm losing my other friend. I feel like neither of them cared about me as much as I cared about them. 

I feel like everybody has somebody that loves them back and for some reason that makes me feel worse. I feel like I give my heart entirely to people and it hurts so badly when it‚Äôs not reciprocated in the end. I know that‚Äôs selfish of me but I wish I knew what I was doing wrong. 

I feel so alone and all I wish I could have was a genuine human connection. It doesn‚Äôt have to be romantic. Just to have someone be there and not leave me. 

My depression is coming back and the negative thoughts are even worse than before. For the first time I‚Äôve really thought about giving up on life because I feel so useless and not good enough. 

I have one friend left but I‚Äôm afraid to rely on someone to make me happy. I know it isn‚Äôt fair. We talked and he made me feel better but when we don‚Äôt talk the emotions come back. 


How can I be happy with being alone. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just want to feel hope and happy with myself. All I do is sleep because the days are too painful to live through."

Smell: look for 2 things you can smell. What can you smell?

The world is a terrible place and life is not worth living,"On a larger scale. I don't understand how people look at humanity and see something worthy. The world is a cesspool. Humans are filth.  

On a smaller scale.    
I don't understand how people find interacting with others fulfilling, instead of draining.    
I don't understand why people would want another person sleeping next to them, taking their free time, always being around them, bothering them.  

I don't understand how people take the small portion of the day that they spend not working, sleeping or commuting, and find the time and willpower to do anything social or productive with it.    
I don't understand why people are ambitious, why they strive to gain status or money.    
I don't understand why people work out or eat healthy. I've tried it many times, for long periods. I've had good health and a healthy, fit body.    
I felt worse, felt drained by spending my limited free time on doing something I don't enjoy, and eating (one of my few pleasures) things that didn't give me a spike of dopamine. I felt no joy at being 'attractive'. I still felt tired, still felt like my body was slowly dying.  

  
The tiny, tiny spike of pleasure at achieving something that I set out to do is NOTHING. It's shorter and less enjoyable than, say, the pleasure of hearing a really funny joke.    
Whenever I manage to achieve something that is supposed to help my depression, all I can think about is how empty it was, how I wasted my time forcing myself to suffer through something I hated doing.  

  
I've tried medications. It works for a while and then I get used to it, it stops working.    
The more of them I try, the less effective it seems. The first one lasted a while.    
It's hard to remember what it's like, but I do remember thinking how beautiful the sunset was, how golden the sun. I remember having more energy.    
I don't think I'm every getting that back."
Anxiety is ruining my life and relationships and IDK how to stop it.,"Background information, I'm 20 years old in 3rd year university for mechanical engineering. 

For the last two years I have had severe anxiety that stems from two things; A really bad ex who lied to me and manipulated me to the point where I was cheated on twice. Track and Field is also my life and when I get injured for long periods of time I go into a deep depression. 

Recently I've been feeling terribly anxious. My resting heart rate is so god damn high because I'm worrying about everything, my relationships, my classes and my job. I can't even focus on class at this point because I'm so distracted and I want to cry so much. Nothing my psychologist does helps me, I hate my life because I'm always like this. I never used to be and I want to just go back to normal. I miss not having anxiety and being able to relax. I miss running T&F, I miss having someone to make me a better person. I'm so heartbroken with my life going down the drain and Idc anymore. IDK what to do.  I can't sleep at night anymore, I'm so exhausted and done. I can't do it anymore. 

Idk why I'm posting this because nothing is going to help."
Just need to talk to anyone,"So I have been a part of this subreddit for idk how long, but never posted anything because I felt like my problems are not important. But now I want to post something. I actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. I don‚Äôt want to be a burden to anyone. I‚Äôm gonna start with what happened today. This story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. I‚Äôm typing this out because the four hours I spent with my fianc√© has been the longest I have felt happy this week and I just need to talk to anyone right now. 

Me and my fianc√© went to the gym this morning. He had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and haven‚Äôt told anyone about our engagement( we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set). We went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. I was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fianc√© was my ride. After that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. I was telling him a funny story about a quest I did in a game I‚Äôm playing. Then I got a phone call from my mom. She wanted to know where I was and when I‚Äôm going to be back. Now I know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. That doesn‚Äôt seem bad but my mom‚Äôs stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. So someone has to be home with him.  

I said ok and we started to head back. This when I noticed that my fianc√© was upset. I asked what‚Äôs wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. He was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. He also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. I started feeling like I ruined the whole day. His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect date/day. On the way back I was just upset and angry with myself and my siblings. I was upset with my siblings because they are all young adult, hell two of them are adults,(21 and 19) but one of couldn‚Äôt stay home for a couple of minute until the rest of my family got home. 

While we got to my house he didn‚Äôt even park, he just stop in first we said goodbye and I went inside. I say that because he always parks in the driveway, gets out, and walks me to my front door. He did try calm me down before hand but I was just so angry. My parents were still home and asked me what‚Äôs wrong and why was I upset. I told them but my mom made feel worse. She made me feel like I should have told her and that it was my fault for not knowing about his surprise for me. My dad tried to tell her that she was wrong and that how was I supposed to know about my fianc√©‚Äôs surprise. 

I was texting and later was in call with my fianc√© while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault. That what happened was unfortunate and upsetting but it wasn‚Äôt my fault. Every-time I tried to blame myself he would tell me to stop. That yes he was upset and he was sorry for upsetting me. It ended with me and him in a phone trying to make the other person feel better but it didn‚Äôt work. Now he has gone to bed and I‚Äôm still awake still upset my eyes burn a little due to crying. 

I just want to talk, just to clear my mind of bad thoughts. I can‚Äôt call him because he has work in the morning and I want him to rest. I feel like I need help, I‚Äôm a mess. I feel like crap my mental state is fucked due feel like my happiness was ripped from me. I just want to start the with a smile and end the day with a smile."
Should I leave this world?,"My friends, my family, even my sister can't understand me. They made fun of me but didn't even know how much it hurts me (such as my study results, my hobby, my looks, etc). You can say they don't care about me, it's not wrong. Am I worth living in this life or I should end these long depressed days?"
My high-5 day:,"I finally cleaned my cooktop after months of grossed-out guilt. And I mean I removed all the parts‚Äîgrates, caps, knobs‚Äîto the laundry sink and scrubbed the the living shit out of every nook and cranny. I also did the same level of attention to my toaster oven. This comes after four days of not getting out bed, so I think it‚Äôs pretty big. "
i just got rejected,i‚Äôve been in love with this dude for months and it finally happened. he said he didn‚Äôt have feelings for me and he never would. i feel like an idiot and fool for thinking he could love me. he was my favorite person and now i‚Äôm lost. the darkness is consuming me and i want to let it. i hate myself for not being good enough
I don't know how to approach teacher about F in the class,"Hi everyone. I'm currently in my second semester of college and my depression has really taken a toll on me. I have been really trying to get my shit together and for the most part I have- except for my journalism class. I have never gotten below a C in a class, but right now I have an F because of missing assignments.  I'm registered with my school's disability center but I don't think that will help me with this. The teacher emailed me to tell me that I was failing and that I could go to his office hours if I wanted to discuss my grade. I am terrified that he is going to withdraw me or tell me that it's my fault (which it basically is). Has anyone gone through this? Were you able to pass?? Any advice would be appreciated."
Daily breakdowns. TW: suicidal ideation and self harm,"I'm a 17 y/o trans man. I have anxiety, depression, ADHD, and am a victim of sexual assault. I've been out as trans for 2+ years and in that time my family has done next to nothing to accept me. They stand firm on use of my birth name and female pronouns, regardless of how much it upsets me. I spend atleast an hour a day having a breakdown from this.(sometimes much more) I've considered suicide more than I'd care to admit. I have to force myself not to cut. I'm stuck and feel like it wont get better."
Something I wrote and thought some of you could relate maybe,"Depression is more than a dark cloud following you around. It‚Äôs pain, it‚Äôs sadness, it‚Äôs weight on your shoulders, it‚Äôs guilt, it‚Äôs frustration, it‚Äôs a lack of feeling like you‚Äôre enough, it‚Äôs an assumption that you‚Äôve made about yourself that you‚Äôre not worth a *damn thing*. You look in the mirror and you might as well have the word mistake written on your forehead in permanent marker. You go through moments where you feel everything at once and then other moments where you feel nothing at all. You have reasons screaming at you to leave it all behind but your voice of reason is shouting *‚Äúno!‚Äù* in the far distance. Dreams remind you of the pain that your mind can‚Äôt forget, which naturally means you never get to escape. When you‚Äôre awake you cry and as the tears hit your cheek, they instantly shatter your sanity. In your dreams you may *scream* yourself awake. The feeling of sadness seems to creep into your fingers and toes, making it impossible to pick up the phone and ask for help, or walk into a place where you may find hope. The voice you have is no longer yours, it almost seems as if you are listening to another person speak, yet its your lips moving. *There would be less hurt if I wasn‚Äôt here. There would be less worrying on others if I weren‚Äôt here. There would be less‚Ä¶* Your mind even is too tired to finish the sentence. *You will be ok.* They tell me but it‚Äôs easier said then done because they don‚Äôt feel this.. *I have lost everything. I have no idea who I am anymore. Why am I here? I take 1 step forward and I fall at least 10 steps back. I need a sign that this isn‚Äôt for nothing.. that I‚Äôm not nothing.* "
I wake up hating myself,"Every day is a fight for me [25m] to push suicidal thought and I don‚Äôt want to act on any of it .Im used to it at this point really.I try and be productive and normal I try and  help others,start projects ,go to work but I‚Äôm always in this deep pain where I can‚Äôt bare to even think I‚Äôm a good or worthy person. Of course I masks every thing with jokes and a fake smile but It doesn‚Äôt help. I don‚Äôt know what can make me happy make me little comfortable . This subreddit help me out a lot and there are time that I really just wanted to die but you guys helped out a lot .I just never know what to do anymore.death is not an answer but I just don‚Äôt like being alive and it‚Äôs scary."
I feel unwanted and unloved,"I‚Äôm 19yr girl. I‚Äôve always had a rocky life. I‚Äôve had an eating disorder since I was in 6th grade and,I‚Äôve always thought that I was never enough.Then in 2017 I went through this long period of having severe health anxiety to the point where I would think my hand would stop working if I thought about it too much(Ik it‚Äôs weird)...lately it‚Äôs been my bf who‚Äôs made me feel like I wanna die. He has basically been cheating on me this whole relationship.we‚Äôve been together for a year and 6 months. Today he told me he almost had sex with some random woman he met on the street. 
(Basically she asked him if he wanted to have sex and agreed then he changed his mind )Before this he has only cheated on me with people online,but this really destroyed me.i basically have no self worth anymore.ive been emotionally wrecked by this.i feel like I have no reason to live.Hes my only support,if I leave him I will be alone.i just need some help rn .I‚Äôve felt depressed for many years now but I feel like nothing ever seems to get better."
Needing help with my inferiority complex,"I'm a 19 year old brazillian guy who had a Very lonely life as a kid and as a teenager due to my Mother being overly protective,so now i'm basically a person with many socializing problems and a constant fear of being judged by others.I just want to know If anyone here has passed through the same and how did you grow out of it."
Stop telling me I cannot continue having a lazy life please.,"I'll be honest, if you're sitting at home with no have school or a job because of depression, you'll get kinda used to the positive sides of it. And whereas I understand my parents' frustration that I haven't been doing anything for almost a year now, I can't take their rants at me anymore. I have not chosen for my life to be like this at only 21 years old. 

Anyway, perhaps I *am* to stubborn and lazy? Because I got used to it? My parents tell me I can't keep living like this till my 80th, and they're also not going to let me stay in the house for that long. It's not like they would kick me out very soon though, as my older sister moved out at 25 years old. Anyway, whereas I haven't been feeling miserable and really depressed for some months now, I still feel unhappy and I do get frustrated because I don't find purpose in my life. I still can't find hobbies or passions that I truly enjoy. I don't really have dreams either. And because of the fact I don't have much that makes me enjoy life, I don't feel like looking for a job because I know that won't make me appreciate life more. It would probably do the opposite instead.

I do feel a little bad about it, because it's kind of ""obliged"" to work, at least at some point. Everyone needs to work. Otherwise you can't make money, and without money you die. But I guess guilt is the major reason for me to feel bad for it. But the other part of me still thinks I haven't chosen to have been born or become depressed, and therefore I feel like it isn't fair that I owe society something. 

I think this is the end of my rant. I just don't know what to do or what to think about all this.

I'm sorry if I offended any people that are still in college or work despite their depression. That's not my intention."
"I‚Äôm not sure if I have depression, please reply, I made posts to other subreddits and no one answered and it‚Äôs making me feel even worse","I‚Äôm 16F btw. For many many years I‚Äôve been extremely upset with my weight and my looks. I hate everything about me, I could give you all the things I hate about my appearance in a heartbeat. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I think ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt look too bad‚Äù and sometimes I think ‚Äúoh god I can‚Äôt go out I‚Äôm so ugly‚Äù. My weight has become a really bad obsession. I think that because of problems relating to how I see myself I might have gotten and eating disorder? I‚Äôm not sure because I can‚Äôt self diagnose. But, I have lost noticeable amount of weight by eating 1-2 times a day and limiting my calories. And I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs extreme dieting or an actual eating disorder. I‚Äôm scared to go to the extreme and go underweight (I‚Äôm close to being it) because I have a deadly disease and could die if I‚Äôm not eating properly. And I‚Äôm not too educated on ED‚Äôs so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm being too dramatic. Back to my ‚Äúdepression‚Äù, I moved during 5th grade and had no friends until high school, people openly avoided me because I kept asking people if I could play with them. This one group of friends made it extremely obvious that they don‚Äôt want to be near me, which hurt a lot. Lots of boys said behind my back and in my face that I‚Äôm ugly, horrifying, repulsive, a ugly octopus, sewer rat, etc. That really hurt me back then, still now. And I do believe I‚Äôm all those things they‚Äôve said. Then a miracle happened. I made a friend. She was a cool kid and the time I spent with her was the best I‚Äôve ever had with someone besides my family. Then after few months out of no where she acts like I don‚Äôt exist. She never spoke to me and treated me like a stranger, and it hurt so much it still bothers me. I thought that I did something wrong, that I wasn‚Äôt good enough, or I was too ugly that she didn‚Äôt want to be seen with me. Then in high school I finally made friends. During 10th grade my friend told me that my crush of 6 years called me super ugly and said who would want to date her? That shattered everything. And now I believe that I‚Äôm so repulsive that I will never find love and I will be lonely forever. Fortunately, I made friends, and one cool thing I do with a group I‚Äôm really close with is that we have ‚Äútherapy‚Äù sessions and we talk about our problems and try to cheer each other up. I‚Äôve yet to have my ‚Äúsession‚Äù yet, but I accidentally gave away that I hate my body and they think I have body dysmorphia, I think I have it too but I can‚Äôt say cause I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed. Honestly it made me feel so good that there were people who were concerned about me but that never happened again. They never speak about it like they speak about other friends problems... That‚Äôs probably because I haven‚Äôt told them all this, and I would‚Äôve but I‚Äôm afraid. What if all of this is me being too dramatic. And that what I‚Äôm feeling isn‚Äôt serious and they think bad of me. And I‚Äôm scared to go to a therapist because of that same reason. So I rather keep all these emotions inside, and almost every night I cry because of these problems. Most of the times at night, I feel empty, lifeless. If I close my eyes I imagine I‚Äôm floating through space lifeless. My thoughts are very dangerous because I keep thinking more negative, and to avoid that I go on my phone and distract myself by doing something. Because of my disease I have to take pills daily, and I‚Äôve always thought that I have an easy chance to kill myself by taking a lot of them, but I don‚Äôt think I would because it‚Äôs a sin in my religion, but maybe one day I‚Äôm too down that I might do something... Can someone please tell me if this is depression or not, because I really want to overcome it. Please reply to this, I‚Äôve made many posts on other subreddits regarding this and no one has answered, which makes me feel like no one truly cares. Thank you."
Everything was going great and then it went downward spiral,"I don't know what to do and it's too early for me to be crying. But my ex (who I still love and care for so much) just messaged me this morning asking to hang out because he's moving and we might not see each other again. 

&#x200B;

Background of the story: we broke up maybe 2 weeks ago and he's been battling depression, hence why I am here to learn more and help him about his situations. Never thought I would be the one actually seeking help here for myself. (I can't really think of anything else right now, I'm too sad about it).

&#x200B;

I don't know, but I feel so down and broken right now. I just need someone to talk to about this and I don't know what else.."
I can‚Äôt enjoy the things I used to like,"I don‚Äôt know what happened. I‚Äôm 17f and I suddenly stopped liking music and watching movies and TV shows recently. I don‚Äôt really have any motivation to do anything. Before, I would try to finish all my schoolwork so that I could listen to music and watch stuff without any stress. I never felt this way until my senior year in high school. 

I don‚Äôt know if this was built up due to stress, fatigue, and my age or if this change was just sudden. The reason I mentioned my age and gender was because I think these things played a role in how I feel right now. I don‚Äôt mean to be TMI but ever since I had my period, I‚Äôve felt some type of depression. I thought it was some hormonal imbalance and that it would go away but I‚Äôm not sure. Right now, it‚Äôs hard to recover. I‚Äôm still always tired and unmotivated. I want to rest still but I can‚Äôt due to school. I haven‚Äôt had the healthiest lifestyle. I think I was sleep deprived, my diet didn‚Äôt have a lot of protein, and I rarely exercise.  

The only thing I want is to feel the way I used to before. I don‚Äôt know if how I feel right now is temporary or permanent. I hope I don‚Äôt need medication. Thank you to anyone who reads this."
I feel like a terrible person,"Okay so recently my mom went on Facebook and said she was going to kill herself, she then went one and blamed two of my sisters and I. People at my school saw it and now everyone knows I‚Äôm the reason my mom wants to die. That‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm mad however, I‚Äôm mad because I have a 10 year old little sister that she was just going to leave, and even though I don‚Äôt talk to my mom everyday I‚Äôm still hurt that she was just going to leave me. I feel so guilty that I‚Äôm mad at her because I also struggle with mental health and I‚Äôve been there before, and I‚Äôve felt what she feels but I‚Äôm still SO angry at her. She‚Äôs never been the best mom, she‚Äôs hurt me in the past so many times and this whole thing makes me want to cut her off for good, and even though she‚Äôs hurt me so many times I know me wanting to just leave will hurt her, so I‚Äôm trapped. Please people of reddit, what should I do? And am I a terrible person for being mad at her?"
How do you respond when your boss asks you if you're happy?,"I'm 58 years old and newly diagnosed with depression for the first time in my life. I was promoted at work and the stress was unbearable and threw me into this. Depression. I turned the job down but my life hasn't gotten any less stressful.The location where I work doesn't qualify for FMLA although we do have a leave of absence. I'm sure I'm going to be fired soon because after 6 years on this job I'm making mistakes. Fear doesn't really help anxiety does it? So my boss asked me ""are you happy?. I don't even know what I answered; I think my mouth worked like a fish out of water. I don't know if I said I'm trying or I was, or what?the look on her face was like yep that says it all.
Edit to update: 
My anxiety meds kicked in enough that I could talk to my boss calmly. I explained that this wasn't just a case of the blues. She asked if a less stressful position would make a difference. I told her I thought it might. but of course I'll have to take a cut in salary. I guess that's better than no job.
I wish I'd never taken that promotion. It's cost me my career my sanity and my income."
I have been diagnosed with PTSD and depression .... warning this is very very dark,"Ik this will be a waste of everyones time but even if no one reads this I need to write it down....I'm 14 now....back years and years ago when I was 4 my eldest sister  raped my 4 year old self  she had mental issues...she started cutting me with knives and making me watch her cut her self.....she continued this till I was 9...that's when she finally moved out of my family's house...she had drilled it into my brain that what she did to me was ""notmal"" and if I told my parents or other siblings  she would murder them...so I never told anyone....not until a month ago current time... after my sister left the house she still kept in touch with my parents....my parents constantly made me visit my sister which brought the memories back...my sister hadnt changed she'd threaten me any chance she got...I started feeling so so depressed. And on top of that my father started...acting worse....he used to be so nice but I think the stress of my sister (they knew she had mental issues just not what she'd do) I think the stress kinda broke him... I felt like I'd lost my family around that time I was barely coping but then something worse happend.... my hands started going numb...I started having flashbacks...of a sort....dreams I was sleep walking...slowly but over a course of a few months I'd lost almost all feeling in my hands and started getting dizzy...my hands started hurting and I started getting sick more often...and every time I'd get sick my whole body would go numb...not even figureitivly my body REALLY was going numb... soon things became progressively worse and my parents took. Me to doctors  after doctors....they all did tons of tests on me but couldn't pinpoint anything...in the end they ended up just saying  welp we dunno but I guess you'll end up calling it fiber myalgia... a while after that my condition had worsened so much I decided to quit ice skating...one of my favorite sports because it was to painful for me...and since I'm homeschooled that was one of the few places I had friends...I started losing touch with them... I was in and out of hospitals for a number of things...each one being mostly untreatable...my other sister (not the one who raped me) my other sister said I made my problems out to be bigger then they were...I found out that if I DIDN'T speak up about anything they'd worry and see just how much I had trouble...so I stopped talking I continued trying to handle everything myself I kept the thing that happend in my childhood a complete secret....no one knew... it was eating away at me...I had almost no friends I was  depressed  and in pain 24/7... my parents sensed I was depressed and they tried to tell me it was a ""side effect "" of my condition. Which made me feel as though they were saying my feelings weren't my feelingss...  it built up...then one day on my birthday my parents invited my eldest sister to the house.... when she arrived she was visibly pregnant...none of us had known... she  had all the attention on her the whole day and I kept worrying how she'd parent the child when she was so cold hearted...  she told me that day that she would no longer harm me...because when the baby arrived it would be her new play thing she said.... I felt sick               to the stomach it was my 14th birthday and that was the day I attempted to end my own life... I had left a letter explaining everything about my sister to my mother and other sister... I had left that letter knowing they'd save that little baby from my sister...then I let go and tried to die...I felt so sad..all my life I looked toward the future with bright eyes...and I had decided in one moment I couldn't continue farther....turns out my parents had invited one of my last  friends over to surprise me...he was the one that walked in and found me nearly dead...when my parents saw me I'll never forget how my mothers face looked or how uncaring my father looked. They rushed me to the hospital  and I obviously lived or I wouldn't be typing this..  I still feel depressed but really dont want to die...but I am having trouble finding a reason to live... my mother is the only one who ever found and read the letter so she and I talked about my sister...my mother loves my sister very much and had a hard time with it...another reason why I didn't tell anyone... she just had no idea that was going on... my sister  dropped contact with my family and fell of the radar...I assume my mother had something to do with that... the baby? Well my sister had a miscarriage only a couple days ago...around the time she fell out of touch... I haven't pressed charges on my sister..I just can't get myself to do it... I know this is probably the lamest stuff to be depressed about but I honestly don't want to go to counseling where someone is PAID to care... I feel depressed like any other 14 yr old I guess.  And I don't see a future for me anymore... I'm sorry this was long and I'm sorry if I wasted your time. I just needed to type I guess...."
Fuck me in particular,"It's amazing how on the inside I know I need help, and see how available it is yet I don't. It's almost as if I'm working against myself in some sort of satanic ritual where I'm addicted to sadness, even when it's killing me. 

I can't be the only one, right?"
"""depression paralysis""","how do I explain to my parents about what I like to call depression paralysis. you know when you're so heavy you literally can't move. you just want to drink that water. or to roll over. or to do anything!!! how can I explain that to my mum!! she just doesn't get it and it's really hard letting everyone down by being a worm :( I wish I could just explain it so they would understand and not be so hard on me you know!


any advice is welcome :))
I hope ur doing okay :')"
I'm just not in the mood,"For anything really.

I hate when I have to do the thing.

But I don't wanna.

But I have to do it.

And so I don't do it for a while.

Because I think it's gonna help me do it later somehow(?)

And then when I'm confronted with the fact that I have to do it, I have to do it under stress.

Because I wasted so much time not doing it at first."
It gets better and I‚Äôm living proof :) you can do it,"(TW: I include some old journal entries which include a lot of self hate/suicidal thoughts) 

The last couple years have been ROUGH. I‚Äôve struggled with depression, ptsd, anxiety, and a whole array of other issues. I‚Äôve been abused to the max in every category. I have known the deepest, darkest depths of pain possible for someone to go through. I went through a really rough time this year. 

To give an idea of where my headspace was at, Ive copies some old journal entries below. 

‚ÄúI have tried all my life to make up for the worth I was born without. All of it has been in vain. Worth is something intrinsic not earned. Shit will always be shit no matter how much you dress it up. That‚Äôs what I am - a worthless piece of shit.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI am in so much pain and I am so tired all the time. I can‚Äôt sleep, my body won‚Äôt let me eat, my mind won‚Äôt let me rest, my soul is too broken to be repaired and it‚Äôs becoming more and more painfully obvious every day.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI just want to be loved. I know I‚Äôm not good enough to be loved, but my heart breaks and longs to know what it‚Äôs like to be whole and to be wanted. I desperately want to be loved.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNothing keeps the pain at bay anymore. I used to be able to drink or smoke it away but now I can still feel it. It‚Äôs presence is dulled but there nonetheless. It‚Äôs like my lungs can never get enough air, never enough of my soul can escape the pit inside me to start actually living. Why the fuck am I here. Why the fuck am I alive.‚Äù 

These are just a couple of the many, many entries I have. I hated myself and was SO depressed. There were so many days I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed or even convince myself to eat. It was hard and there were so many days I just wanted to give up. But I didn‚Äôt. And I am so thankful I kept going. 

Now, I am celebrating my first anniversary with the love of my life. I have amazing friends i adore. I am about to graduate college with honors. I absolutely adore my soon to be in law family. I have adorable pets. I am genuinely happy. I actually love and like myself. I‚Äôm excited for tomorrow and actually want to be alive! Honestly, life is pretty great right now. Not that it doesn‚Äôt have its challenges, but it‚Äôs so worth it. 

My life is unrecognizable when I compare it to the season I was in when I wrote those things in my journal. It has been hard. I have done a lot of work in counseling and on my own. For a while every day was a struggle. But now, it‚Äôs not. The days are getting easier, my depression has gotten further and further away, I have genuine and contagious hope. I made it out and hot dog I fucking LOVE life. 

If you‚Äôre reading this and you need some encouragement today, please take my story as proof that anyone can overcome this. I know it‚Äôs hard, especially with so many people in isolation and in quarantine. But I promise it‚Äôs worth it to keep going. You have no idea how good life can be on the other side unless you give it a chance. Your life and your future are worth fighting for. You are strong, you are an overcomer and you can do this. 

I believe in you and I am proud of you for making it this far :) I hope my story can serve as encouragement for somebody who might need it. I really do promise it‚Äôs worth it. The fight is hard, but keep fighting. The victory is well worth the effort. Keep on fighting loves."
I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation.,"*(tl;dr at the bottom)*

Although I have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isn't one of them. But it is the problem of my now ex-boyfriend.  
He isn't someone who talks much and I really tried to talk to him but it's hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of ""I don't know"".  
So I thought I'd ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he can't (Of course I know that you can just make guesses but I'm trying really hard to understand him and I'm just so confused.)  
We both have our own problems but as a couple I wouldn't say we had any major problems. In the last months his depression got worse and I tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when he's feeling very bad and then I just try to give him enough space. That's why we're not as close as I would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so I was patient. We didn't see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when I came back, he broke up with me. His reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks I'm feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. (Which I think is true and at the same time isn't... It's definitely not just a friendship, but because I tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we weren't already there where I would like my relationship to be.)  
That was two months ago. We're still texting each day and sometimes meet - we're not having sex or kissing but still, he doesn't treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesn't want to. We're officially broken up... but we're not just friends.   
I explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didn't think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this - although it seems that this didn't improve anything for him.   
He said he doesn't know what his feelings for me are but he doesn't want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend.  
I don't know what to do. I want to give him time but as far as I know, he's doing nothing to improve his situation and I can't take this much longer.   
I know that most people - especially in the relationship subreddits...  -  probably would just tell me to put an end to this and forget him. To confirm that I'm not totally delusional for thinking that we might get back together, I've talked to some friends... and surprisingly, no one told me to just give up and that they're confused, too, and also think that his behavior isn't that of ""just a friend"".

And now, I'm still here because I've seen that he really cares about me and feels more for me than for a friend. I have the feeling that the actual reason for the break-up and what's standing between us aren't not enough feelings or arguments or any other stuff... but his depression. Many people tend to cut people out of their lives too easily and I don't just want to leave this awesome person behind because he's going through a hard time.  


**tl;dr**: Boyfriend has depression and broke up with me but still treats me more like his girlfriend than just a friend. His reasons didn't sound like they have much to do with me but more with his depression. Doesn't know what he feels for me but doesn't want to lose me and wanted time to think and work on his problems - but isn't really doing anything. I have the feeling he wants to be with me but his depression prevent him from doing so. I'm so confused and don't know what to think or how to help him.

So... I'm not sure how to phrase my question or even what exactly I'm looking for... I guess I just want to hear some other thoughts on this.  
Does anyone of you ever left a partner due to your depression? Is it possible that his depression is so predominant that there is no space to develop intense emotions for another person?"
I'm terrified,"I'm terrified that I'm going to spend the whole of my life wanting to die. I'm scared of suicide and don't want to attempt it, but I'm also afraid of living. 

I'm so scared of failing the people around me but I feel like I'll do that no matter what. I haven't spoken to my best mate in days (a long time for us), and I'm both terrified of losing him and of letting him down by being a burden. I just..can't pretend to be happy with him right now, but I don't want to bring him down to my level either or worry him. Hopefully he'll forget about me.... holy fuck, what if he forgets about me?

I'm afraid of becoming overwhelmed by work, but I can't seem to get myself out of bed and get the work done. I'm too scared to face it.

I'm scared of leaving my room in case I see roommates. I don't want to talk to them or for them to see me like this. I need to eat but I'm afraid of going out to buy food.

I know I'm spiraling. I know the depression is taking over. I'm terrified of that happening, but at the same time I don't know if I WANT to be in control any more. I'm too scared of that too.

Fuck. I'm just afraid. Of everything."
LOVE,"I think most of us would agree that love is the most important thing.

To love and care for someone and to have that love and care reciprocated.

One would think that something as fundamentally important as love should be something easy to understand, easy to give, easy to receive.

In reality, however, many of us have difficulty knowing what love is, and difficulty knowing how to both properly give it and receive it. 

In the world today, love is confused with sex, whereas sex is only an expression of love.

Love also gets confused with limerance, or the feeling of ‚Äúbeing in love,‚Äù this too, is mainly a chemical and hormonal response to a person who seems desirable usually in a sexual way, which again is only a limited expression of love.

Many of us do not know what love is‚Ä¶ little wonder, because in todays movies, tv and music they frequently portray love as limerance or ‚Äúbeing in love,‚Äù as sex,  as enmeshment or even as codependency‚Ä¶ but none of these represent true love, but rather a warped and out of context view of love.

Then, to compound the problem beyond belief, many of us were raised by parents who were cruel and abusive physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically‚Ä¶ the terrible scars left on us make it ever so difficult for us to know what love is, how to show it and how to receive it, especially when we have never experienced what normal love is.

Love is like a multifaceted diamond. As a child, we are supposed to be taught by experiencing it, that love is unconditional, consistent,  reliable‚Ä¶ it should provide a sense of safety and security when we feel scared or vulnerable‚Ä¶ it should engender an atmosphere of openness and honesty with a sense of confidence that even if you did something wrong or bad that you will be helped and nurtured to do better.

This is by no means a definitive explanation of what love should be, but is an example of what too many of us have never experienced. 

For too many of us, love was conditional, inconsistent and unreliable, vacillating between what appeared to be love, but we knew could turn into the worst of abuse in an instant‚Ä¶ and so love never provided a true sense of safety and security‚Ä¶ when we did something wrong or bad we generally had confidence that we would be further abused.

In this sort of environment, as abused infants and children, we did not know why we were not loved‚Ä¶ as an abused infant or child we formed the only conclusions we could‚Ä¶ on a fundamental level we started to believe that we did not deserve love‚Ä¶ we didn't know what we did wrong but we started to believe there must also be something seriously wrong with us and that we should feel ashamed and guilty about it‚Ä¶ if we had needs and wants then we were made to feel ashamed and guilty for having them.

For many of us, a feeling of love had more to do with behaving in a manner that got our parents approval, and so we learned at a very young age that what we think, feel and want is not as important as the way our parents perceived us‚Ä¶ being truthful was not as important as being safe. Being honest and vulnerable was not seen as an opportunity to be shown love, help and nurturing, but as a highly likely situation for further abuse.

In our early teens we start to experience feelings of romantic love‚Ä¶ our young minds still do not know what normal love is, but by now we know that our parents are incapable of giving us the love that we need. So we start to fantasize and idealize romantic love in our minds as the thing that will heal the deep wounds cut into our subconscious minds, believing that we need another person to undo the emotional and psychological wounds that we carry.

As children and teenagers we are introduced to the concept of love through music, tv and movies. These influences further warp our sense of love into something like sex, or enmeshment, or codependency, as though ‚Äúbeing in love‚Äù is the pinnacle of what love is, and the ultimate validation of our self worth.

Little wonder that few relationships last for years, let alone decades or a lifetime‚Ä¶

For many of us, we not only start off life with a handicap, but usually a large portion of our life is devoted to just figuring out what the hell went wrong in our lives, when and why and how‚Ä¶ a great deal of us find the process far too confronting and distressing and turn to drugs or alcohol, or to other self destructive behaviors in an attempt to escape from or dull our pain.

One of the main problems with cognitive behavioral therapy is that abuse in our infancy or babyhood, is generally not stored in the logic center of our brain, so logical reasoning alone cannot undo much of the damage that is stored in the emotional fear response part of our brain, typically associated with, but not limited to, the fight or flight response‚Ä¶ however, this is also where some of our core beliefs of worthlessness, unlovableness and fundamental shame and guilt over simply having needs and wants are stored‚Ä¶ this is because at a very young age, these emotions were inextricably linked to fear and danger and pain that must be avoided at all costs.

That is why also, for most of us, dealing with our issues is first dealt with through severe denial, distraction and suppression, because our minds associate our vulnerabilities with severe pain and anguish and does everything it can to avoid facing up to our vulnerabilities. 

As if in a cruel twist of fate to sabotage the rest of lives, we are rarely attracted to the type of person we need to fill our emotional needs or to help us heal. Typically we are attracted to people who are oblivious to our pain and behave in such a way as to exacerbate and further entrench our emotional damage. Why? Our early childhood taught us that uncertainty almost always leads to pain‚Ä¶ we were taught that when we did have certainty, there was a greater chance of avoiding pain. Therefore, when we met the people who could actually fill our emotional needs we were filled with uncertainty, even contempt. Why? Because these people were usually quiet natured, emotional and not afraid of vulnerability and valued openness and honesty‚Ä¶. All of these things put us on high alert for potential danger and pain and we are repelled by the things that our subconscious associated with danger.

What our subconscious associates with safety is certainty‚Ä¶ so ironically, we meet people who were like our parents, mainly interested in filling their own needs, people who do not talk about vulnerable emotions, people who put on a good front‚Ä¶ all of these things our mind is attracted to because it is familiar with it and therefore feels safe‚Ä¶ we easily slip into relationships of codependency, relationships where our people pleasing, validation seeking and approval seeking find their best use. Usually this is with self centered people with narcissistic tendencies. These people themselves are not to blame for the perpetuation of your abuse because they themselves are products of their childhood that made them who they are who were‚Ä¶ attracted to you as a person to meet their codependent needs or narcissistic tendencies.

One of the most soul destroying, depressing and confronting truths you will ever face is the fact that your entire concept of what love is, is wrong‚Ä¶ you've never experienced love or given love‚Ä¶. You've only ever given and received your concept of love which may only amount to sex, enmeshment, codependency or ‚Äúbeing in love,‚Äù none of which on it's own is true love.

To fix this problem we need to go back to our childhood where everything went wrong. The challenge is that sometimes we need to remember back to our infancy or babyhood if that is where the abuse began. Unfortunately this is also where many of our deepest scars were made, and it is also the time of our life where we retain the fewest conscious memories‚Ä¶ so to go as deep as we can we often need to rely on what we know about our parents and combine it with what we know would likely have happened. Here is an example from my own life:

As a young adult, I knew I hated porridge, the very thought of it activated my gag reflex. This I knew was because my mother force fed me porridge every day as a baby. It wasn't until my 40s that I realized the deeper damage that my mother had done. As a baby, I didn't like porridge, so like most babies I spat it out‚Ä¶ this made my mother bang loudly on the table in disapproval, she would yell and scream and hit me for spitting it out‚Ä¶ when I learned that the only option was to swallow and then scream, my open mouth would be shoved full of another tablespoon of porridge, she would even hold my nose to stop me screaming or spitting so that I would hurry up and swallow so I could breath and scream only to be forced with another table spoon of porridge. Sad story‚Ä¶ but in practical terms this led to far more damage than a revulsion of porridge‚Ä¶ this is my earliest memory of subjugation‚Ä¶ the feeling of dread associated with having no choice but to do what you are told or implied to do‚Ä¶ subjugation by fear and consequences of pain and shock and humiliation. It also contributed to an underdeveloped self, where my personal preferences were completely irrelevant and dangerous. It also contributed to enmeshment where I quickly had to learn to do and accept and behave exactly as I was expected to make the trauma and abuse end as quickly as possible. Here is another example from my childhood:

I can't remember why, but I remember being dragged to the bedroom by my ear at about age 6‚Ä¶ I was given a solid beating with a belt and put to bed‚Ä¶ as most 6 year olds would do I cried hysterically, loudly, inconsolably, sobbing‚Ä¶ as an adult looking back I think this made my mum feel bad‚Ä¶ she didn't like feeling bad so she came back in my room to give me another hiding for crying so much‚Ä¶ another sad story, but in practical terms, as a child it taught me that I will get punished for feeling sorry for myself‚Ä¶ in effect teaching me that self love, self-soothing is bad and I should feel shame and guilt for it, even self hate.

For me personally, this has been my experience‚Ä¶ my parental abuse led further to feelings of subjugation, enmeshment and an underdeveloped sense of self‚Ä¶ this led to people pleasing, approval seeking and validation seeking behaviors as well as codependency‚Ä¶ all of this was unsustainable and ultimately led to my severe depression and anxiety.

It is not hard to imagine why so many of us with childhood abuse are debilitated by self hate, feelings of worthlessness, intense guilt and shame for doing things that make us feel good‚Ä¶ and continuing to do bad things that make us feel good because we were taught that this was the price to pay for feeling good.

So how the hell do we undo this?

Not easily and not quickly‚Ä¶ it takes a great deal of time, and concentrated, deliberate, repeated effort and even then your progress will be measured in small increments.

To undo the damage, you first have to recognize what the appropriate response to your abuse was. As a child you naturally expressed this appropriate response by crying, screaming, yelling, throwing a tantrum‚Ä¶ but all of these responses, in your case, were met with an even greater level of violent humiliating abuse‚Ä¶ our young minds had no choice but to convince itself that the appropriate response was an inappropriate response, even a dangerous response.

Now because these memories are not purely logic based but are stored in our fight or flight response center of our brain, we cannot access or change these through logic, or cognitive behavioral therapy alone. In order to access this stored memory we first need to trigger it. For me, triggering the sense of worthlessness and unlovableness meant getting in touch with the feeling of being in love, but having that love unreciprocated or even rejected‚Ä¶ this pain I was able to intensify by listening to my most painful heartbreaking love songs. Knowing that changing this visceral feeling had little to do with logic, I meditated on the fact that this intense feeling of wanting and needing reciprocated desperate romantic love was a complete lie‚Ä¶ it's not and never was a true representation of love‚Ä¶ I meditated on the fact that the concept and truth about what love is was stolen from me by the abuse of my parents‚Ä¶ then I let myself get angry‚Ä¶ at my parents, even though they themselves are products of their own abusive childhoods‚Ä¶ I got angry at the injustice of life itself‚Ä¶ I started to feel, the way a child would naturally feel when wronged for the first time, indignant, outraged, angry, generally pissed off‚Ä¶ I listened to music to encouraged the feeling of defiance against outrageous abuse of power such as Leo Morachioli ‚ÄúKilling in the Name of‚Äù and ‚ÄúGive it Away‚Äù and ‚ÄúSabotage.‚Äù In all fairness, these songs and these feelings will not make you feel love, but they will help you to wipe the slate clean‚Ä¶ they will give you a sense of justification for feeling angry that you had valid innocent needs and wants that were not met, that you were abused and that you have the right to not be happy about it.

Of course, none of us want to spend the rest of our lives angry, but neither do we want to spend the rest of our lives apologizing for the fact that we have desperately unfulfilled emotional and psychological needs‚Ä¶ the scarey part is allowing ourselves to move into uncharted waters as we explore the person that we really are, having full trust and love for ourselves knowing and believing that we will rise above ourselves, and be an even better version of ourselves than we ever imagined that we could be‚Ä¶ but first, we need to be willing to explore those parts of us that we have tried for so many years to deny, suppress and distract ourselves from.

From that point on, you can start fresh‚Ä¶ you can start giving yourself commendation, praise, validation and approval for every single good thing that you say and do. You can stop giving a @#!@ what other people think about you, because you know that whatever you did or said was exactly the right thing by you‚Ä¶ because you can be guaranteed that most people in this world won't care one tiny little bit about you when making decisions or saying what they feel they need to say.

You simply cannot love others if you don't love yourself. If you come from a place of self hate, self loathing or low self esteem,  what possible love do you have left to give away to others? On a basic level you don't even believe that you have anything good at all to offer anyone‚Ä¶ so you can't show true love to others until you learn how to show true love to yourself‚Ä¶ this means being prepared to put your feelings, choices and preferences above those of others without the guilt or shame you were taught to feel. Only from that concrete position can you give consistent, reliable, unconditional love to others‚Ä¶ you cannot do this from a place of emptiness.

Even then, when we have done everything we can, most of us may still find ourselves in a world that is less loving, less nurturing and less accommodating than we need‚Ä¶ however, this is yet another reason to make sure that you come from a rock solid concrete basis of knowing who you are, knowing where came from, knowing what your needs and wants are, and knowing that you have the right to expect more from life than you got."
"Is it normal to ""think"" you're overcoming depression when everything you do shows otherwise?","I've had depression and anxiety for over 8 years. I feel like I'm way better than I was before but sometimes it feels I'm just lying to myself. Is it normal?

I feel I'm pretending I don't see this dark monster looming over me everytime I say I'm getting better. I'm on antidepressants and they help but it feels I'm going to take them forever. I tell myself I'm more social now! But I know for a fact I only talk to two friends and more often than not ignore them when they want to hang out. I feel like I care about my appearance now, but I'm heavier than ever. I feel like I care about my future but I keep missing classes because I simply cannot find the will to go. I want to have a relationship but everytime someone interested approaches me, I panic that they'll know there's something wrong with me and leave me.

I'm usually very bubbly and positive on my daily life but when I stay quiet for a moment, I feel as if I have this mask that threatens to fall off and show everyone how I really am.
At night I refuse to aknowledge my intrusive thoughts so I fall asleep while reading, listening to music or watching videos. Am I avoiding reality? Is it a good coping technique? What is it?

I just can't trust my own thoughts because they were the ones that led me here so I never know if I'm taking the necessary steps towards recovery and this is a normal setback or if I'm lying to myself and pretending everything's getting better  because I can't deal with the fact I'm never going to get out of this hellhole.

(.....And now I'm thinking I'm being dramatic and I need to get over it and I should not post it because maybe I'm enabling my depression every time I try to aknowledge it. Damn. Sorry for my english btw.)"
Proud of myself still keeping my shit together,"The fall this year is brutal. One moment it is nice and sunny, and the next one it‚Äôs a gloomy Gothic hell. It‚Äôs gonna be like that for the next 7 months where I live (think Eastern Europe). My therapist says she has an influx of new clients. I‚Äôm mostly okay, but sometimes I just get an urge to step into traffic. It‚Äôs been generally a shitty year. I thought I‚Äôd recovered from depression. I‚Äôve been healthy for 4 years before that, but it‚Äôs been too much lately. I moved from my dorms to live alone, broke up with my best friend of 10 years, faced the worst creative block in my life in my first year of art school, was assaulted by a stalker, went through bureaucratic hell trying to file a police report, fucked some nasty stranger because he said I had nice butt, and, finally, experienced a bad acid trip. There were, of course, a lot of good things. I feel like I‚Äôm finally getting out of an artistic stasis and ditching drugs for good, therapy and meditation are helping lots, I kinda made up with the friend and had many great moments with other friends, and had a blast at a summer music festival. Although, you know how it is - depression makes you focused on negative stuff specifically. Every day I do my best to get just a little peace of mind, but it feels like a Sisyphus‚Äô task. There is always a scary tiny voice that‚Äôs telling me I don‚Äôt really deserve all of that self-care, showering and stuff, not jumping under buses, things like that. Turns out, it‚Äôs possible to be ungrateful and distrustful towards your own self.
The best thing that‚Äôs happening right now is that I‚Äôm finally getting the courage to tell my story (mainly, writing shitty poetry and showing it to friends. Or anonymous Reddit posts). I‚Äôm also going to book an appointment with a psychiatrist as soon as I have money. So we‚Äôll see. Maybe I‚Äôm not a Sisyphus but the proverbial frog after all. "
"I‚Äôm there for my friends whenever they need help, no one is there for me when I need it","Recently a few of my friends have been hit with some form of depression, whether it‚Äôs been going on for a long time, sometimes it was more serious than other but no matter how big or small I was there for them. This has been going on for about two months.

Helping them has distracted me from how shitty my life has been the past few years, but now that I need help they all look the other way. I‚Äôve been posting on Snapchat asking someone to talk to me they ignore it, said that I feel upset about something and they will send me a message with no effort behind it, I have always messaged them when they need someone to talk to.

They know what‚Äôs been going on in my life too, I just broke up with my girlfriend of two years and after a few months we tried to give it another go, one thing lead to another and she‚Äôs given me an STD when I haven‚Äôt even looked at another girl since. They don‚Äôt know about the std but they know how upset I am over her and they all act dumb towards it. I feel so stupid :(

Tl;dr I help my friends when they needed it, I recently started needing a bit of help and they don‚Äôt even try."
Does anyone else hate themselves for not being happy?,"I haven‚Äôt gone to a doctor, so I‚Äôm not entirely sure I am depressed. I haven‚Äôt been happy for a long time, and I get mad at myself for simply not being happy. I hate myself so much, especially for being depressed, but I don‚Äôt know why. I have no idea why I‚Äôm like this, but I hate myself so much. Idk what to do with this. I‚Äôm really hoping one of you knows what I mean.

EDIT: it‚Äôs like I hate myself for hating myself. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I feel weak or what."
Depression: An Extremely Practical Guide to Making It Through Your Depressive Episode,"Hey everyone! I made this guide awhile ago and posted it in /r/rbipolar and /r/depression. /r/depression removed it because their focus is not on solution-based content, but since I recently found this sub I thought I'd share it here as well. It by no means covers everything, but I'm hoping it will help some people here. 


Depression: An Extremely Practical Guide to Making It Through Your Depressive Episode 

So ages ago I came across an awesome guide to dealing with a depressive episode, which helped me immensely. I have been searching high and low for it to share, but I cannot for the life of me find it anywhere. If these tips ring a bell for anyone and they can get me the original to share, or you know the author, please let me know. 

In the meantime, here is my very practical guide to dealing with a depressive episode, based on what I pulled and use from that article as well as my own experience. 

[Note: I‚Äôm not a medical professional or a therapist or anything. These will not work for everyone. This is just a compiled list of things I have found useful, people I know have found useful, or I have read from other writers.]

Including: 
-The Very Basic Basics 
-Food 
-Personal Hygiene 
-Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross 
-Asking for Help 
-Summary of Lists to Prepare for Next Time 

**The Very Basic Basics**

1)Don‚Äôt Die 
It sort of goes without saying, but the end goal of dealing with a depressive episode is to make it through. So as long as you are still alive, good job! If you start thinking seriously about suicide, reach out and get help ASAP. Tell a trusted friend or family member, call a suicide hotline, or call emergency services (911 in America) or go to your nearest emergency room. 

2) Bare Minimums 
Moving forward from that, it's a good idea to lay out what the bare minimum for your day-in-the-life of a depressive episode. And I mean the absolute bare minimum. The more things you feel like you need to do, the harder it is to get up and do any of them, so make a very short list to start off. Once you are started on that list, often it's easier to continue with the momentum, but start small. 

For example, my list is:
Get out of bed at least once 
Take meds/vitamin 
Fill water bottle to drink throughout the day 
Eat at least one (1) thing
Do one ‚ÄúHave To‚Äù and one ‚ÄúLike To‚Äù (see next point) 

Theres plenty of other things I shoot to do, like showering and teeth brushing and eating more than just A Thing, but absolute worst come to worst, that's my very basic basics. 

3) Have To‚Äôs and Like To‚Äôs 
Try, everyday, to do one thing you have to do, and one thing you like to do. This is good because it shows you that, no matter how slowly you are moving, you are not stagnant. You are moving through this depressive episode. 

Make your Have To‚Äôs and Like To‚Äôs  proportional to your energy that day. On an okay day your Have To might be a load of laundry and your Like To might be a long walk. On a bad day your Have To might be wash one fork and your Like To might be to watch a funny youtube video. Baby steps. 

Don‚Äôt worry if you are not actually enjoying your Like To. Depression can kill your ability to enjoy anything, and that's okay, just do something you know you usually like. It will help you notice when you are starting to come out of the episode to see yourself begin to enjoy the things you usually do. 

At the end of the day, as long as you are alive and doing at least what you need to to keep that up, good job! 


**Food**

So in terms of food, the name of the game is to eat some. To do that when you barely have the energy to stand up or put on pants, you are going to want food that is as easy to make as possible. Also think about adding a multivitamin to your daily routine to help with the vitamin deficiencies your less-than-perfect depression diet probably has. 

[Note: I'm not a nutritionist. Note #2: I‚Äôm super white and all my examples are going to be pretty boring white-guy foods, because that's what I eat while depressed. Please take the general concepts listed here and modify to better foods if you can think of them]

Buy stuff in advance 
You probably don‚Äôt want to go shopping when you‚Äôre depressed. So sometime between episodes, stock up on things you can buy in advance and store until they are needed, like canned and frozen food. I‚Äôm not going to make a big list because it varies based on what you like, but whatever it is make sure it's food you at least enjoy regularly. Depression makes most things taste terrible, but if you like it usually it will be slightly easier to stomach. Bonus points for things with more than one major food group in one. Think things like:

Hearty soups/stews with protein and grains
Chef Boyardee or other kids pasta that contains a full veggie serving
Frozen Tv dinners that have a protein, veggie, and grain 
 
Whatever it is, you basically want stuff with instructions that read something along the lines of ‚ÄúOpen, Microwave, Eat.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs also a good call to have some stuff in your cabinet that involve cooking, but that are easy and reheat well (see point 3). 

2) Grocery Shopping 
If your episodes are long, then at some point you are going to need to go buy some food (or ask a friend to get some for you, see: Asking For Help). There‚Äôs nothing worse than gathering all the energy to go to the grocery store, getting overwhelmed, and ending up coming home with just a box of cereal and a block of cheese, so again, prep a list before the episode hits. 

This is your chance to get the things that you can‚Äôt store in advance but that will still be easy to eat. Again, you want to get things that you like, and that require little to no effort to prepare. 

Stock your fridge with cold foods you can eat as they are. It depends on the things you like, but think along the lines of 
Yogurt 
Chicken or Tuna salad
Veggies you can eat raw (baby carrots are my fave) 
Hummus 
Cheese 
Sandwich meat 
Fruit (if you think you‚Äôll eat it fast enough. Mine always ends up going bad) 
Milk (whole and soy have a bunch of protein) 
Pre-made sandwiches
Etc 

Also stock your pantry with easy to eat stuff like 
Bread (for sandwiches or toast with peanut butter or whatever) 
Crackers (for hummus/chicken or tuna salad/to put peanut butter on, or just to eat)
Cereal 
Snacks (See below) 

3) When you can cook, use that energy well 
If you have a day in a depressive episode when you have the energy to cook, or you have a friend over helping you, make sure you are ready to cook something that a) you like b) is still relatively easy to cook and c) you can make a bunch of and eat for awhile. 

As with the canned and frozen stuff, bonus points for things with multiple food groups all in one. Extra bonus points if it's something you can make in one pot/pan/dish. Think about these things in advance and have stuff on hand to cook. I always keep pasta (the hidden veggies kind!) and tomato sauce in my cupboard and some frozen ground turkey or beef for pasta with meat sauce. I know a lot of people who make great stir fry or curry with only a few ingredients that they can keep on hand. Whatever works for you. 

When I‚Äôm done cooking, I like leaving it all in one big tupperware, to have fewer things to clean (see: Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross) but I know other people prefer dividing it into meal-sized containers so they don‚Äôt have to worry about choosing serving sizes. 

4) Snacks! Make them useful 
Sometimes meals are tough. No worries, snacks are easier! But in choosing snacks, work towards ones that add up to the calorie and protein/vitamin content of a real meal. You are also probably going to eat some chocolate, which is totally cool, but think about adding something like 

Nuts/trail mix
Granola 
Protein/granola bars 
Beef Jerky
A giant spoonful of peanut butter (I know I‚Äôve mentioned peanut butter a lot but it's so easy and good) 
Or other foods with similar benefits

5) Drinks 

DRINK WATER. As much as those ‚Äúall you need to cure your depression is 8 glasses of water a day‚Äù posts are utter BS, water is extremely important and you need it to not die. Water bottles are easier to keep around than cups, so grab a water bottle you can keep on the couch/in your bed with you, and drink up. 

Whole milk and Soy milk both have a lot of protein per serving, and almond milk has a ton of vitamins. 

If you have a really hard time motivating yourself to eat, but there's a meal replacement/supplement you can drink, give it a go. Ensure or Carnation Instant Breakfast or something along those lines. If you find a protein powder that isn‚Äôt super gross, that's good too. Try not to rely too heavily on these, but they make a great addition to food. 

Drinks with a bunch of vitamins like v8 are a great addition as well. V8 also has a line of fruit and veggie drinks if you are like me and thing tomato juice itself is hella gross. 

Smoothies? I‚Äôm a big fan, but a whole blender can be a lot to clean for some people. I‚Äôm not talking crazy recipes with fresh kale and blueberries and 14 types of fish oil, but milk, a frozen banana, and chocolate chips is an easy, filling snack.

NO BOOZE. I know there's a temptation to drown sorrows in alcohol, but seriously it's a bad idea. Alcohol is a depressant on its own, and will probably make things worse. Also it will make you more dehydrated and whatnot. Just stay clear until you‚Äôre feeling better. 

And drink water. I said it before, but again, make sure you drink enough water. 


**Personal Hygiene**

OK so this one gets tricky, because I don‚Äôt want to be the one saying like, ‚Äúmeh, it's fine to bail on basic personal hygiene things‚Äù but when push comes to shove, if you can‚Äôt do 100%, it's good to have a compromise instead of doing 0%. So, a few points: 

1) Teeth:
If you only have the energy to brush once a day, make it right before bed.

Mouthwash is not as good as brushing your teeth, but it‚Äôs way easier, so in a pinch, grab some listerine, swish and spit. 

2) Showers 
Feeling gross will make you feel worse, so try to prioritize a shower of some  kind every other day or so, based on your energy level. 

You can compromise the amount of things you do in the shower to motivate yourself to get in. So instead of your 14-step shower routine with shampoo and conditioner and soap and that fancy exfoliating body wash, etc, tell yourself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get in the shower, and I‚Äôm going to wash my armpits, and then I can just stare blankly at the floor until I run out of hot water.‚Äù Odds are, once you get in there and have the soap in hand, you‚Äôll be able to keep the momentum going and wash the rest of you. If not, at least you don‚Äôt have stinky pits anymore, and that's cool too. 

Washing your hair is also a good thing, because it will overall make you feel less gross, but don‚Äôt let that become the tipping point that makes a shower too hard. Some people have found success with dry shampoo if that's easier. 

If you can‚Äôt manage a shower, have some baby wipes on hand that you can at least hit your pits with now and then. Again, these are awkward things to compromise on, but on your worst days anything is better than nothing. 

3) Face 
Baby wipes are also awesome for your face if you don‚Äôt have the energy to wash. 10/10 would recommend. 

4) Baby wipes in general 
Baby wipes are just in general great. Keep some in your bathroom for face/body washing, keep some by wherever you hole up when depressed (bed, couch, comfy chair) for wiping hands off after eating. Anything you need to be clean and you don‚Äôt have the energy to do in the traditional way, baby wipes can help. 

5) Have a routine 
If you have all your morning/evening bathroom stuff in a detailed routine usually, then it's easier to do it all on autopilot on your sort-of-okay depression days. Ie: always brush teeth first, then get in shower, wash hair first, then wash body, then wash face, then get out of shower, then dry off, then moisturize, etc. Autopilot is depressions friend, and also when your memory is iffy, it's easier to not have to think ‚ÄúWait, did I brush my teeth before I got in the shower? Was that three days ago? Who knows.‚Äù 

5) Clothes 
Wearing the same sweatpants for 4 days in a row isn't great, but really not the end of the world, so don‚Äôt stress too much. Clean clothes can make you feel better though, so change when you have the energy. A good rule of thumb is to never put dirty clothes on a second time. If you have already taken an item of clothing off, as tempting as it is to just grab the same sweatpants off the floor after your shower, grab a fresh pair. You are already 75% of the way there. Grab clean underwear once a day when you go to the bathroom, and when you sit and your pants are down anyway, switch them out. 

If you start running out of clean clothes, laundry is usually pretty daunting, so thats a good time to pull in a favor from a friend (see: asking for help). 


Long story short, do as much as you can to keep clean, but don‚Äôt let being unable to keep up with your usual standards keep you from doing anything at all. Do what you can and consider anything you can manage a win.


**Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross**

The more gross your house is, the harder it seems to clean it and the more daunting that becomes. Also, embarrassment about a messy home can cause a lot of people to isolate because they don‚Äôt want people to come over, either just for company or to help. So, ideally, you want to keep a mess from getting too bad. So here‚Äôs some tips 

1) Trash
Don‚Äôt bother with trash cans. Ok hear me out on this one, trash cans are a nuisance. You‚Äôve got to put a clean trash bag in, walk all the way over to the trash can to put stuff in, try not to overfill it, probably overfill it anyway, then have to really cram stuff in there to take the bag out, take the bag out, bring the bag to your dumpster/outdoor trash can, put a new bag in. That's way too much work. 
 
Instead, grab a bunch of plastic (or paper) grocery bags, and hang them on doorknobs around your home. Put one in the kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom, living room, ect. Make sure you also have one near wherever you hole up when depressed (bed/couch/chair). Just toss your trash in there when you exit a room, and it keeps trash in much more manageable amounts. When it‚Äôs full you can just tie it off and pop a new one on. Or if someone is coming over and you have the energy to straighten up, just walk around and grab all the bags. Done! 

2) Dishes 
Ain‚Äôt nobody got time for dishes. Piles of dishes around your kitchen make it harder to eat, which makes it harder to have energy. Buy yourself some paper plates/bowls and plastic forks and spoons and use those for easy cleanup. Seriously, it's a life-saver. I recommend buying some on clearance after a holiday, because it's not like these are for impressing anyone, what do you care if you‚Äôre eating out of a halloween bowl in June? When you are done, pop those suckers in your nearby trash bag and you‚Äôre good to go. 

If any of your easy-cooking stuff involves roasting/baking, consider also grabbing some oven-safe baking tins that can be thrown out after a use or two. 


3) Disinfectant wipes
If your episodes are long enough that it‚Äôs unreasonable to not do any cleaning through the whole thing, disinfectant wipes are a great way to clean things super fast. Just grab a Clorox wipe or whatever and give your kitchen/bathroom countertops a quick wipedown. Make sure you have these on hand before the episode kicks in, so it's one less thing to grab on your trips out of the house. 

4) Overall 
Overall, try your best but don‚Äôt worry. Nobody expects you to be dusting and vacuuming your house when you have the flu, no one (including you) should expect that when you're in a depressive episode. 

If you are going to give cleaning up a go, but have limited energy, try committing 5 minutes to cleaning the space closest to wherever you hole up, usually a coffee table or night stand. If you are going to have one space clean, it might as well be the space you probably spend the most time staring at.

 Ask for help before it gets too bad. It's easy to fall into a trap where your house gets really bad, and it's overwhelming to clean, but it's also so messy that you are embarrassed to have someone over, even a friend to help with the mess, which just exacerbates the problem. If it's getting pretty bad, but not embarrassingly bad yet, thats a good time to call a friend (see: getting help). Or even if it is embarrassingly bad, still ask for help. Again, you‚Äôre sick, it's okay to be a mess. 

**Asking for Help**

A strong support system is your best way to get through an episode. Having people you can rely on, emotionally and practically, can go a huge way towards helping you through the episode. 

1) Again, Don‚Äôt Die 
I‚Äôm going to say it again, above all else you want to make it through the episode. If you are seriously thinking of hurting yourself in any way, or are having thoughts of suicide, reach out IMMEDIATELY and get help by telling a trusted friend or family member, calling a suicide hotline, calling emergency services (911 in america) or going to your nearest ER. 

2) Explain your depression before an episode
Talk to the people who care about you about the fact that you have depression, and what a depressive episode looks like for you. If they give you the ‚Äúyeah, okay, I get sad sometimes too‚Äù face, you might need to do some work to get them to understand how bad it can be and why you might need their help. If they give you the ‚ÄúOh sh*t, that sucks so much for you that you have depression, I get that because I understand how bad depression can be‚Äù face, then they are a good person to ask for help. 

3) Ask for explicit, practical help from friends and family 

When you say you‚Äôre having an episode, a lot of people will say ‚Äúaw, well let me know if there's anything I can do to help.‚Äù They say this because most people want to, but have no frigging clue how to help you. And it's true they can‚Äôt make you not depressed anymore, but they can help in practical ways. 

When you come across a task that needs to be done, but that you don‚Äôt have the energy for, its a good time to call a friend. They will likely be happy that they get to help you, because they love you and want to, and they will be happy to not have to worry or guess how to best do so. 

So ask for specific things. When they say ‚ÄúIs there anything I can do to help?‚Äù Say something like:

‚ÄúYeah, actually. I know it's kind of weird to ask, but my laundry is piling up and I need a hand with it. Any chance you could come over and help? We can watch a movie while it's in the washer.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, I really need to do dishes but I‚Äôm having a hard time motivating myself. Can you come over and give me a hand? I think I would do better at it with company.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, somehow being unable to get out of bed for 3 days has made my apartment gross and I don‚Äôt know where to start. Can you help?‚Äù
‚ÄúHey, I really need some food, but I‚Äôm having a hard time getting to the store. If I gave you a list, could you pick some things up for me? I‚Äôll pay you back for them.‚Äù 

Its weirdly personal to ask for help with this sort of stuff, but your loved ones who say they are there to help are actually there to help, you just need to tell them how. 

Also, of course, use your own language when asking for help. Mine is a lot less formal and a lot more ‚ÄúHey, one of you nerds should bring my depressed ass some chinese food.‚Äù But whatever works for you and your support system. 

4) Be specific in what you need socially 
In the same way you need practical needs met, it will also be helpful to you and your loved ones if you are explicit with what you need from them socially. 
. 
This is going to depend dramatically on how being around other people affects your depression. A lot of us tend towards isolation, and for some that's effective, but for others it helps more to be in the company of others. It‚Äôs okay to not be yourself or be the life of the party, so if you want company, say so. Again, be specific. You can ask a friend: 

‚ÄúHey, I need some company, but I don‚Äôt have energy to go anywhere or do anything. Want to come over and watch a movie while I lay on my couch?‚Äù 

Or, if it would be good to get out of the house, but you don‚Äôt have much energy, same thing:

‚ÄúHey, I still have way too much depression for doing things, but I need a change of scenery. Can I come lay on your couch while you do stuff?‚Äù 

If a group of friends invite you out to do something, and you‚Äôd like to even though you will be a wet blanket, tell them that. If you warn them, then you won't feel bad about not being yourself. You can say:

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to join, but I‚Äôm still dealing with a depressive episode, so I will probably just sit there. That okay?‚Äù

Or if a group of friends are going out/one friend wants to hang out, and you don‚Äôt want to, it can be good to let them know if they should keep inviting you places. Say something like 

I think my depression is still acting up too much to come out tonight. Thanks for inviting me, though. I appreciate knowing you still want me around, so please keep asking me even if I keep saying no. Eventually I‚Äôll be able to say yes again. 
Or
I‚Äôm probably going to be too depressed to go out for a little while. I feel really bad that I have to keep saying no, so how about I tell you when I‚Äôm feeling better and we can start hanging out again. 

However BE CAREFUL when creating long-term distance from people. You need some people checking in on you, so it‚Äôs okay to isolate from acquaintances and casual friends who you don‚Äôt have the energy for, but make sure to have some close friends around.

5) Talking to casual acquaintances 
It's tricky to explain depression to people who don‚Äôt understand, so in the middle of an episode it takes a lot of unnecessary effort to explain it to casual acquaintances. People like coworkers, friends-of-friends, distant relatives you don‚Äôt like, etc aren‚Äôt owed that level of information about you if you don‚Äôt want to get into it. That is not to say depression is anything shameful or something you should hide. A lot of people feel empowered by being open about it, but personally I just find it inconvenient with that level of acquaintance. 

Everyone has their own tactic for explaining whats going on, so use whatever works for you. It's a good thing to think about in advance, so you are not suddenly caught off guard by a coworker asking why you‚Äôve been so off lately. Whatever it is you want to say, know in advance how much and what you‚Äôd like to share. 

Since mental illnesses are illnesses, it's totally fair to refer to an episode as ‚Äúbeing sick.‚Äù The conversation I use most frequently goes as follows.
 
You okay? You‚Äôve seemed off lately.
Yeah, I‚Äôve been sick. I‚Äôll be fine. 
Oh no, do you have that [cold/stomach bug/allergies] that has been going around?
No, its part of like, a whole thing *gestures vaguely to all of me* It happens sometimes, but I‚Äôll be okay. 
Oh okay, well I hope you feel better. 

That establishes that 1) yes, something is going on but 2) I clearly don't want to talk about it. 3) I‚Äôll be fine so don't worry and 4) leave me alone. 

I use a variation of that explanation for calling out of work, canceling plans with acquaintances, explaining why I‚Äôm not super peppy at work, etc. 

Again, use whatever language and level of sharing you feel comfortable with, just think about it in advance. 

6)Getting professional help 
If you are at the point where a guide like this is necessary, you probably also need help from a pro. Nothing to be ashamed of; no one would expect you to beat cancer without the help of a doctor, no one should expect you to handle depression alone either. 

I'm not going to go into detail about how to find a doc, since it differs dramatically based on your insurance/money/location, but its important. Getting to a doc is a good task to call in a favor from a friend if you need. You might have friends saying ""you should really talk to a doctor about this."" Tell them ""yes, I want to, but I do not have the energy to make that happen. Here is the log-in to my insurance's website, can you find a doctor for me and stand here while I call and schedule an appointment?"" if you have to. 

I'm also not going to make any claims on how to treat your depression in terms of medication, talk therapy, diet, etc, but I will say this: Talk to your doctor and seriously consider any and all recommendations they offer, including medication. 


Summary of Lists to Prepare for Next Time
 Phew! Okay, that‚Äôs the guide. So to summarize the things you should prep before an episode:

Lists to make:
Your list of absolute bare minimums for every day 
Depression grocery shopping list of foods that are easy but can‚Äôt be purchased in advance

Things to have:
Good canned/frozen foods in your pantry/freezer that require no prep
Storable food items that need to be cooked, but are easy
Storable healthy snacks
Mouthwash, baby wipes, and dry shampoo if you‚Äôre into that 
Plastic/paper bags for trash 
Paper plates, bowls, and cups
Waterproof box with a lid for dishes 
Disinfectant wipes for cleaning 

People to talk to/things to think about
Talk to people in your support system to see who understands depression; educate those who do not 
Explain the type of help you might need
Think about what level of detail you want to share with various people so you are prepared for when they ask 

Please add any useful tips i missed in the comments, and again, if anyone can find the original guide that a lot of these came from, please lmk/post it in the comments. 

Hope this helps! Stay safe friends!

"Almost told him I love him and them he reminded me I'm just ""kink community""","Isolation has been really, really hard. I've been seeing a guy since November and at first it was meant to be casual but I have been upfront an honest since I started feeling more. We discussed it and, I dunno, maybe I misunderstood him but he sounded like he decided he wanted more out of the relationship too. But since we haven't been able to see each other for awhile it feels very much like he's over it. And I was trying to explain how out of it I feel because he hasn't been talking to me much and he said something along the lines of ""yeah it's been hard to keep up with kink community right now."" And i...  I dunno. I guess I thought I was more than that. But maybe not. Maybe I'll always only be a sexual object to people. Maybe I not worthy of being loved. Maybe my brain telling me I'm worthless and unlovable and a waste of space is right. I've spent so many years trying to convince myself that's not true but time and time again people treat me otherwise. And I'm so tired of being alone and not being loved. I don't wanna do this anymore. I'm so tired of being a burden."
I'm completely incapable of trusting anyone and can't remember a time when i could.,I feel very discouraged about trusting people I just can't do it. I'm incapable of vulnerability and sharing myself even with my therapist. How can I get over this
"I'm awake for the next two hours and happy to provide some direct support through private messaging if anybody needs a bit of help regarding depression and anything else surrounding it like meds, anxiety, loneliness, relationships, PTSD etc.","Remember to call your local emergency services if you or another person is suffering a crisis or emergency and life may be at risk.

Otherwise I'm here and happy to help for the next two hours (AEST) if anyone needs a bit of friendly depression help and support üôÇ"
Could really use a hug rn,"My gf of 4 years broke up with me a little over a year ago and it was due to my lack of noticing habits I has that were toxic, and for the way I dealt with depression about previous life altering events in my life.  
As it stands right now we had our differences but she was the best thing that had ever happened to me. She helped me grow into a mature adult when I was still doing stupid young man shit. She taught me how to be financially stable. She always showed me the other side of the fence when it came to opinions. And she showed me how to really love unconditionally.
Ever since the break up my father has passed away and she wasn't really there to help me through it which I can't blame her for but still kinda hurt. We've talked from time to time since then. Today she mentioned about a trip she was planning to take in July with the new guy she has been seeing. Yes we are broken up and that's that, however feelings that are lingering still just hurt. 
I'm beating myself up over the fact of how much I let myself down and let her slip away. I've made a promise to myself to never take that kind of love for granted again and never treat another partner like that. 
Right now I guess I just miss all the good time we had and can't see it with anyone else. Been hoping this whole time that maybe we would end up hanging out and get back to a more mature relationship. Not the case. I could use a hug. Thanks for reading everyone."
I can‚Äôt describe what i felt anymore,It will be 2months already since she broke up with me. I already give up to the thoughts that we will be back from each other cause it‚Äôs really impossible. She‚Äôs already happy with her someone new. For me I already accept it and it‚Äôs good to know that she‚Äôs happy already. But its still hurt a lot to the point that there‚Äôs no more tears to cry. My chest is feeling numb to the pain that I‚Äôm feeling. My emotions is like a roller coaster right now I‚Äôm feeling hurt later. I feel empty sad and later on i feel nothing no emotion. I don‚Äôt know at what point of life is me right now
Please,"I hate this. I hate feeling this way. I‚Äôve never had a real job, I‚Äôve never had fulfillment, I‚Äôm not worth a damn and things would 100% be better off without me. I‚Äôm a waste of time, space, energy, and money for everyone I know."
i feel hopeless. I can not deal. I'm almost there again,I try so hard.   But it's really really hard.   I have learning disabilities and no one around that cares.   I'm not like some of the people who think they're depressed on here.   I've been struggling for far too long.
How to be completely honest with my therapist,"There‚Äôs some things I leave out when I meet with her. I think my main issue is that I care too much about trying to impress her instead of being honest. I meet with her at the end of next month, how do I all of a sudden begin to be open?"
Quit my job due to high levels of anxiety. Can't build the courage to conduct exit interview,"I've been with the same company for just over 4 years, but the last year has really taken a toll on my mental and physical health. I have panic attacks before work, throw up due to anxiety. Cry at my desk.

On Wednesday, I caught myself thinking 'if a car crash was promised on my way to work, it'd be easier to get out of bed right now.' So I quit, effective immediately.

I understand this might be a hit immature, but it I told my supervisor 3 or 4 weeks ago after a mental breakdown that I needed reduced hours, or a sabbatical, or something to have time to get myself right, but the work just kept pushing forward.

Now our CEO wants to conduct a exit interview, and just opening my email app to offer times sends me into a panic. I tried to schedule a time earlier today and ended up crying myself to sleep.

So here I am. On one hand I feel like a huge weight has been lifted, on the other hand I am absolutely dreading this last hurdle.

I'm not sure what I am looking for.

Thanks."
"I want to kill myself really badly, but don‚Äôt have the guts to do so","I hate my life. I hate my lack of confidence. I hate my own beliefs and opinions. I hate everywhere I go. I hate how women just hate me. I hate how everyone calls me a cringelord and a beta male and faggot. I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I don‚Äôt even care what my family thinks, I just want to die. 

What should I do? Should I ask the doctor to prescribe me ketamine or something? Speaking of my doctor, I‚Äôve been to 4+ therapists in my life, and NONE of them helped me. I feel like I have no where else to go. What should I do?"
Made a significant step towards happiness.,Deleted Instagram and Snapchat off my phone. Yeah. This may sound stupid as fuck but Instagram and Snapchat were holding me back significantly. I felt like those apps were making my condition go crazy almost everyday. Glad I made this step towards a better life.

I need a little advice,"I have met a new guy (he lives in another state) and we've grown quite fond of each other, he's an AMAZING man. Just recently he went away for about a week, and I wasn't sure why. He messaged me last night and told me he has depression. I messaged him last night saying ""I'm very sorry you're going through this. I'm here for you if you ever need anything, I'll be here to listen <3"" He did say ""It's hard for me to reach out again when I get like this"" 

Now I don't have experience with someone who has depression, so I'm asking:

How can I be there for him?

Should I let him come to me?

Should I text him to check in every day? (or is that smothering?)

What should I text him?

Any and all advice is appreciated <3"
"I feel like my mental health is deteriorating constantly being someone‚Äôs emotional support, I don‚Äôt know what to do.","I have a friend who regularly comes to me for emotional support.

I honestly don‚Äôt mean to sound selfish at all, I really want to help her but I feel like it‚Äôs too much for me to handle.

It‚Äôs a tough situation because I feel like I‚Äôm not fit to be her emotional support as I‚Äôm going through things myself and I haven‚Äôt been feeling great for a while but I don‚Äôt think I can tell her that, I know she‚Äôs going through a lot.
Sometimes I have a meltdown because I feel so much pressure and stress, i don‚Äôt know how to reply to her, I don‚Äôt know how to handle it. 
Feels like we don‚Äôt talk about anything else other than her problems, and I really want to help but it‚Äôs so hard.

I know she relies on me for support a lot.

It‚Äôs been a few years since this has been happening. She‚Äôs always coming to me, and I‚Äôm pretty sure only me and I feel like a sponge just absorbing all her sadness.

Maybe???,I believe that my depression derives from my constant thoughts of existence. Maybe if I were to find out my purpose for living I wouldn't be as depressed as I am.
Feeling guilty and Tired of looking for helps,"(I think) I've felt depressed since 2 years because of study, family, relations, future work, etc.

Wednesday 8, I posted a thing here and was given some advice (thank you) 

Friday 10, I decided to go to the hospital. And I was admitted right away.

Still, during the hospitalisation that lasted 10 days, I didn't feel better.

They treated me with Valium and then started antidepressant Monday after admission.

&#x200B;

Now I'm back home, with my own depressive habits.

I don't want to talk everyone around me, even my best friend because I'm feeling guilty of being their burden.

It seems that I repeated everything to everyone over and over again. Every time I've talked about myself is even causing me more depression but still with no solution...

I have been trying as hard as I can to get over her but I can't; therapy and psychiatry doesn't help, new girls don't help, working on myself doesn't help. I don't want to become an incel-type of guy but these thoughts are ruining my life. I just want to talk to her but I know I can't, and I don't want to start feeling entitled to her attention.

"Me and my partner are both depressed, but him much more than me","i've(20m) been with my boyfriend(21m) for a little over 2 years. 

i've always struggled with depression on and off through my life and suffered some severe trauma as a kid. i haven't been to a therapist more than twice in my life.

my partner has had depression ever since he was a kid, he says it's been constant and sometimes he doesn't notice it as much but he says he's always been very depressed. he has never been to a therapist.

we struggle a lot with our relationship. i want so bad to help him and make him feel better. we're a great pair, add a lot to eachother, and understand each other's problems and worries really well. but, while i feel i can kinda manage my depression and it hasn't stopped me from functioning before, he is completely debilitated. 

a lot of the things we do together seem to make him upset, bored, or irritated - and these are some of our favorite things to do together. i've felt that way before too, and i understand he's just as frustrated as i am, but i feel lost when it happens and i dont understand how i can fix it.
i have a really strong fear of abandonment and i cling really hard onto him when i'm at my worst. it's really bad because when he's upset he pulls away, he's afraid of hurting me and others and he directs all his frustration inwards. but by pulling away i pull him harder and its a vicious cycle that leads to us crying and me freaking out, having a near panic attack because he's been ignoring me. 

i don't know how to help him, how to be there for him, i dont even know how to help myself. i let him know he can talk to me and he does and i usually end up trying to give advice. sometimes i just listen but i dont know what to say afterwards, i know he doesnt want advice but how else do i respond or stop the conversation from hitting dead silence or repetetive uh-huh's. 

i love this man, he's the love of my life. i want to spend forever with him. but im terrified of losing him, of hurting him, of failing him. 
how can we support eachother? how do i try and comfort him, and how do i communicate what i need without fear of being too needy?

right now we are both very poor and in college. i have a free therapist on campus i can visit, but his school doesnt have that and he would have to pay to visit a therapist, which we absolutely cannot afford."
Crying over nothing.,"Does anyone else not want to go outside and if they do end up having to talk to someone feel like crying. Last month or so I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (while already having ADHD diagnosis at 1st grade) and I've not wanted to leave my apartment or go to class and I hate it. I went to class the other day and talked to my teacher about what's been going on and why I've missed class and I almost cried in front of her... Whenever I go out and about to get groceries I feel like there is a tickle in my eyes as if I want to cry and just go home. I used to never really do this, I used to never cry in public, it's just very weird to me... "

I‚Äôm done.,"I‚Äôm done.

I don‚Äôt know why today is the day that broke the camels back, but I feel like bursting into tears. By all standards my life should be great. Loving parents, amazing spouse, Good in-laws, good paying job, nice new home, stable friends, and no major health problems. But I just sit here and writhe in emotional pain, I feel like driving my truck into a concrete barrier. 

I‚Äôm an adult. What could I possibly be sad about?

I tell people around me I don‚Äôt feel right, like how I‚Äôm abnormally stressed, anxious, or sad. Everyone dismisses me. Not a rude way but, in a manner like ‚Äúhey man we all feel that way sometimes.‚Äù My loved ones around me feels so needy, like if I were to hand off an ounce of my pain it would shatter them. I sit here and smile, do my best to join in on the conversation and not draw undue attention to myself.

My day to day job is being a Doctor, I get to help people and it makes me feel like I have purpose. But it‚Äôs not enough. I try to save money, not spend too much on myself, donate to others. But it‚Äôs not enough. I try to enjoy little hobbies, get outside, play with my dog, spend time with my friends.  But it‚Äôs not enough. 

I still feel sad.

I reach out on forums for depression and ask ‚Äúdo I have a problem?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs it normal to feel this way?‚Äù And not even the masses have comments for me. I don‚Äôt want to commit suicide because I would feel too responsible for the pain and mess I left behind. But if I was told tomorrow is my last day, I don‚Äôt think I would fight it much. I feel like help only comes if you do something dramatic. It makes me appreciate how brave people are for reaching out for help. Posting this is the best I can do.

Cannot motivate myself at all... help.,"I've been dealing with depression for a while and anxiety too. I am in a viscous circle. This semester in college started out great...was getting A's on everything, doing generally really well. Then I found out that my grandmother who I'm super close to was being put in hospice care and is very very sick with heart failure. Then my grandfather passed away suddenly. I feel like my professors don't believe me, because it happened weeks apart from each other. I stopped going to class, dropped one because I didn't go to an exam. I literally have not been able to get myself to write papers for one of my classes. I feel like I'm losing it. I haven't done laundry in weeks and have no clean clothes. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist but didn't show up. Same thing with an appointment for an advisor to ask for help choosing classes. I just didn't show up, no call no show.  I've been desperately trying to fix myself but I get overwhelmed anytime I start studying or researching for this paper. I'm too ashamed to seek help because I didn't show up to previous appointments.

editing because I feel like I ended this thought too soon:

&#x200B;

I have become really good at seeming fine and normal, but I'm just lying at this point. I feel so much guilt about everything so it's like some fucked up defense mechanism to at least appear okay.

How do I love myself?,"I've been really feeling depression for about 2 years now, and I've found that being productive and learning about myself has really helped. I just feel so dependent on other people to make me feel good about myself, and I want to know some ways I can feel loved by myself."
I'm Unable to Receive Love Even When I Crave it So Badly,"I really can't receive love when it's about to come to my way. I don't know why my first instinct when someone put their interest to me is to freak out or push them away. And it's not because I don't like them, in fact I really want love from someone and to be loved back.. I'm sure it'd feel amazing and will make me feel great even. But everytime that happen or I can sense it's about to happen I shut myself, I close myself up. I don't think I'm worth of their love, if they really know who I am they won't stay around for so long. I feel like I'm not worthy, no one will actually be proud to have me. I'm not even proud of myself right now.

Maybe it's true that you need to love yourself first to be able to love others. But honestly, how do you do it? What to love about me when all I see is disappointment in myself? I don't ever feel great about myself. Is there a person that want to be with someone that keep looking down at themselves like this? No one will have the patience to wait someone that barely look at themselves in a good light or wait to open themselves up. Why would they even try, I rather not waste their time."
Confused...,So I'm not a member here... I'm just having a really hard time.... I don't know if I am depressed or if I'm just unhappy....
Do I even want to be better?,I just feel like lying down forever. I don‚Äôt know. Maybe getting better isn‚Äôt for everyone. Maybe I want to be miserable. Is that what I want? I don‚Äôt even know anymore. I‚Äôm a mess.
I do not know what to do anymore and I honestly just legitimately don‚Äôt want to be alive anymore,"I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with depression, but I definitely have been depressed for a very long time and I‚Äôm honestly coming to realize that things have honestly never really been that great and I honestly just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm down to be alive, when I think about everything and what it would take to get there, it just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to me, I am loosing all of my friends and finding it extremely hard to go out and do things and have normal interactions, I graduated higher school last year and instantly started loosing myself, during high school I actually thought I might have a chance of getting better and feeling happy, but I really think now that I just don‚Äôt wana be happy, it litterally is harder to be happy than sad now a days, thanks if you read this, let me know what you think, I know these are problems everyone have but no advice or suggestions are helping and I just don‚Äôt know"
Going through an episode & my bf is having a boys day,"My boyfriend is perfect and precious and the best at being supportive. All of my friends are his guy friends (all the girl friends I‚Äôve tried to make just hasn‚Äôt worked out, don‚Äôt get me wrong I love them but hanging out with most of them just leaves me drained) but he needs just a boy‚Äôs day. I‚Äôm having a major depressive episode but want to be a good girlfriend and let him have the house. But I don‚Äôt want to get out of bed for 8 hours :/"
How do i cope with un-ending sadness,"So my partner has been dealing with sadness and suicidle thoughts all their entire life its so extremely hard to help them i do help every time we are together its perfect absolutely perfect for both of us i am everything to them and i help as much as i possibly can but theres only so much i can do as we arent together every single minute. they have been hurt by their previous partner and emotional damage from their moms emotional and physical abuse in the past ranging from brith i think until her 5th grade year thats when the physical abuse (slapping cornering shoving head under bathtub water pushing into walls) but the emotional abuse has continued until this year about a few months ago their mom has been very extremely nice to her randomly for no reason. My partners depression gets extremely bad she is constantly sad and frequently has suicidle thoughts and gets very overwhelmed with her home life has asthma attacks and panic attacks for apparently no reason. I am running out of ideas i have done everything for her and i am continuing to do so but my mental illnesses sometimes makes it almost impossible to help and vise versa. She had said many times she wants to get better so bad and get out of her house when shes 18 so we can get engaged but she says she cant see a way out i have alot of experience with helping people out of suicide but the longer this goes on the worse i feel about how good of a job i do with her i used to feel very good about our phone conversations because my advice was always perfect she would go from a full blown panic attack anxiety attack to laughing with me making jokes and talking about all the things we were going to do in the future and how to achieve our goals now it seems like they end in her not actually feeling better just acting better or pushing the thoughts away. 
Please help me find ways to help them cope for the 3 more years they have in their house and how to help her get from the ground up as i have to do this 5/7 days now."
I think I give up,"I tried to talk to people and got pushed away. I tried a therapist and she didn't help. I tried to get a better lifestyle. I am tired of faking it, feeling tired off everything, crying myself to sleep and waking up scared and sweating, and most of all I am tired of people saying that they are their for me and turn their backs when I need help. I just want a hug I want to feel like I mean something to someone even just for a moment. But I am giving up it will never happen. I am sorry for bugging any of you. Just need to say what I was thinking. I'm sorry.."
Are you depressed? Lack of support?,"Hey,

If you feel down and need an advice?

Remember these things.

1. Stay calm - for few seconds atlest you must be                    blank, stay away from struggles you are into.
2. Try to Remember your loved ones,  may be your dad or your mom or your pet.
3. Close your eyes take deep breath till you fill comfortable - this will help you to relax.
4. Don't take decisions when you are depressed, just don't take.
5.  If you still panic try mediation - if you wonder what mediation is? It's very  simple - just concentrate on your inhale and exhale. Just do this for sometime.

By now I trust you would be little better , now try to speak to someone you trust.

You can contact me anytime.

I really want to help as many as possible.

I am a yoga trainer, just stretching my helping hand.

If anyone found this helpful, please comment. So that others can really take it seriously.

Stay blessed stay happy

"""How to Save a Life""-- my nightmare","i was listening to ""How to Save a Life"" by the Fray and it just hit me how many people who are listening have probably lost their loved ones and felt helpless at some point because they ""failed"" to save them. idk why but the idea was so potent and charged with such strong sentiments that for a second i urged myself to trade shoes with one of these people and the feeling had me crying so hard. i felt idle, like a disappointment, like i failed someone i didn't even know who in a way relied on me to end their misery but instead i just watched them slip away into thin air while my hands were cuffed. the desire to reach out and grab their hand with every muscle in my feeble body was there but not strong enough to cast off the shackles of oblivion, ignorance and apathy. as the song went on , i was still trapped in this body of a someone who didn't know how to save a life. a life that felt incredibly real and close to me even though it was a mere figment of my broken imagination. the idea of this person drowning in a sea of dark wishes, hopeless thoughts and broken hearts had me gasping for a nonexistent power to just invade my own imagination and toy with the plot, hoping for a happy ending one that unfortunately wasn't meant to be. as the video neared its ending i began to imagine the countless lives ending as i stood inert,helpless and hopeless. i wished i could save all of them but i soon realized that i don't know ""how to save a life"" and neither did those people."
so hard to be alive,"just like my name suggests... throwaway for obvious reasons

every now and then i always think about how hard it is for a human being to stay alive. like, there's all these standards you have to live up to, there's all these people judging you all the time, so many factors.

i have a partner that always tells me off every day for very random reasons. today it was because of a girl that added me on social media and i pressed accept, but i haven't talked to her; we just met during a trip that we all went on recently.

i quit my 6 year job recently to pursue an entrepreneurship, now swimming in debt because my product isn't ready to launch yet and i have zero income (actually i have negative income because i still need to pay employees)

my partner wanted to get a dog so now we have a puppy that i have to deal with during the day whilst still working on my useless startup that's not going anywhere. i lack motivation every day because i already feel exhausted dealing with this puppy...

i have no friends, well actually maybe i do have friends but firstly i'm afraid of talking to them because i don't want to get judged, and also because if i do, i have no idea how my partner's going to react (as most of them are female).

ehhh.. i'm just ranting now, i don't expect anyone here to even give any shits about me really -- you don't know me, i don't know you, why would anyone care?

how does a human stay alive?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

you know what i always think -- there's so much stress in my life that it's actually so much easier to just kill myself and be done with it

think about it this way right, if you're dead there's nothing to worry about because you're dead.. how good is that? there's absolutely nothing for you to even care about

it's like the easiest and fastest way out of every single problem

you know what also, i look at my puppy and i feel that even her life is better than mine. she has nothing to worry about, all she need to do is to complain and she'll get pats, cuddles and food. when she's bored she can just fuck around without any care in the world.

&#x200B;

i wish i was dead. but i'm afraid of pain

maybe someone can tell me the fastest way out of this mess?

&#x200B;

this post is such a waste of time, if anyone actually read this far, i'm sorry for wasting your time. i probably shouldn't have even posted this.

&#x200B;

oh i didn't read the rules... given that this is a new throwaway, i'm guessing this post will get deleted anyways. thanks for letting me rant into the trash section"
"During your leave,what helped you guys from depression?","After 7 years long battle of letting depression take over my life, something has finally snapped and now I'm taking over my life. I'm dropping the year off. Yay!! My friends told me to think about it again but I know that this is the only thing that will help me out. 

So what helped you guys during your leave days?"

When Love is Not Love,"For those of us, who as a result of childhood trauma, suffer from codependency, depression, anxiety, feelings of worthlessness or feelings of unlovableness, our view and understanding of what love is, is likely not the view or understanding of others who did not suffer childhood trauma.

An infant or child has an underdeveloped sense of self and other. Therefore, when parents divorce it is common for a child to blame themselves and internalize the marital breakup as being their fault.

Similarly, in an abusive childhood, on a visceral level, a child is taught that he is worthless, unlovable, defective, lacking on some fundamental level. An infant or child may not even consider that the parents abusive actions are not deserved. 

When such a child survives the trauma into adulthood they may learn that the way they were treated was not right, however, no amount of logical reasoning easily removes the deeply imbedded feelings of worthlessness, defectiveness, shame, guilt and unlovableness. Why? Because the child has learnt a core belief on a deep primal and emotional level. The child does not question if he is lovable, he KNOWS in his core, without thinking, that he for a fact is unlovable, worthless, defective and that he should feel intense shame and guilt for talking about it.

Is there hope? Is there a way to undo this terrible damage? It seems that it is not possible on a purely logical reasoning level. 

This has been my personal truth my whole life and I am now 44. In deep discussions with my wife I confirmed my suspicions that my view of love is not the view of love of those who have not suffered childhood trauma. For those without childhood trauma, love is not something that completes them, it adds to and enhances the complete individual that they already are.

On the other hand, for those of us who are survivors of childhood trauma, at a core level we believe we are defective, unlovable, worthless, incomplete. Our adolescence taught us that love is the thing that we need in order to fill this inconsolable pain in our heart. We fantasize about love, we fall in love with the idea of being in love, such aspirations fill us with a sense of longing and desperation to ease our internal pain. 

The only problem is, is that all too often, this does not happen. Even if we find someone who truly loves us for who we are, they never seem to be able to fill that chasm in our soul. The reason for this is because we were taught to believe, and we thoroughly believed an incredible lie our entire lives. What is that lie? The lie we were taught was that we do not deserve consistent love because we are worthless and unlovable. As a teenager we become desperate for the love, attention, validation and approval of others and we take over the role of our parents and we tell ourselves that our feeling lovable and worthy depends entirely on someone else finding us lovable and worthy. Therefore, we spend our time looking for that special person to complete our defectiveness‚Ä¶ and of course, in our imagination we find them from time to time‚Ä¶ but after the honeymoon period wears off and each persons individuality sets back in, we are again left with this gaping hole in our very being that our partner no longer seems to be able to fill.

These are things I have only come to grip with this week. Like everything, I expect it to take quite some time to heal and to learn new coping strategies. Now when I hear a love song I think, ‚Äúhmmm‚Ä¶ that's a good enmeshment song.‚Äù Yesterday I listened to a long list of my favorite desperate love songs from the 1980s,  songs that triggered in me that sense of desperately needing someone to fill the hole in me where love is suppose to be. With every song, while the emotional memory of defectiveness was triggered, I gently reminded myself that this emotion is a lie‚Ä¶ so far, this has been my strategy‚Ä¶ not to simply identify and correct internal dialogue, but to connect with the emotional triggering memory as intensely as possible while doing so‚Ä¶ today I feel much better, and able to collect my thoughts and share them with you because sometimes our view of love is not in fact love, instead we have a foundation of self hate that we want others to fill because our parents did not."
"I‚Äôve been told by multiple people that care about me to seek help from a therapist, but every time I‚Äôve seen one my anxiety goes through the roof because I have to share intimate details of my life with a stranger.",How can I convince myself that it is the right decision to get help when it just feels like every time I try I slip back into bad habits.
Most likely will be laid off tomorrow. I can't go through this again. I just can't.,"Have been struggling to rebuild my life after my first layoff in 2016. Finally got a job I love in my industry last November. Today layoffs were announced. I was the last hired so will likely be laid off tomorrow. I owe tens of thousands to credit cards that I have been partially living off since my first layoff, plus student loans, plus 25K in penalties to the IRS for taking money from my IRA to pay my mortgage. My industry is fucked and I will not be finding another job that pays over minimum wage. I dont think I can handle this again. I am not strong enough. "

Wife is depressed and I need advice,"My wife and I have been married for 8 years, but she‚Äôs been dealing with depression for the past 10 months. These last 2 weeks are just a mental roller coaster with her crying all the time and saying that she feels empty. I try to cheer her up by taking her out to different activities, walking and playing with our dogs, telling jokes to make her laugh, and everything else that I‚Äôve been doing as a husband during our marriage. During her current depressive episode, she admitted to me that she took 8 sleeping pills instead of the 2 recommended per the prescription, which only made her drowsy the next day. I am conflicted on what to do because she doesn‚Äôt want to touch me or me touching her and she always just wants to be alone, even the dogs can‚Äôt cheer her up. I‚Äôm at my breaking point trying to walk this line and not say something that I would regret, but I need advice on what to do. I love her very much, but it is very stressful dealing with someone who doesn‚Äôt want to meet me in the middle.

Edit: I forgot to mention, she is already seeing a psychiatrist and that is who prescribed the sleeping pills."
"Thinking of you, Pete","It broke my heart to read Pete Davidson‚Äôs message about his suicidal ideation. I find him to be a very real person in the midst of the fabricated reality that is the entertainment industry and his honesty about how his life is tormented with Borderline Personality Disorder and suicidal ideation is a reality that I have close experience in, given my education and work history in the mental health field. 

It is evident that Pete is trying his best to cope with his breakup while juggling his daily battle in feeling uncomfortable in his own skin. By sharing his struggle with BPD, he is demonstrating enormous courage by revealing his humanity on a very public platform- a vulnerability that‚Äôs too often ridiculed by criticisms despite his noble efforts of trying to help others. 


Obviously, helping others and spreading joy through laughter gives him a sense of purpose by helping him cope with ‚Äúnot wanting to be on this earth‚Äù- an earth that has lately been invalidating and capitalizing on his very real and very raw suffering. 



I hurt when I read his message because anyone with true empathy and compassion can feel his hurt in the way he wrote it- and it‚Äôs something I can relate to in my own ways. I commend the bravery, honesty, and respect that he shows himself in what he needs to do in order to feel okay (deleting his IG, posting his feelings, etc). 

And for Ariana- I‚Äôm extremely disappointed in her actions. I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôm just an outsider to this entire situation and of course, not completely informed of all the details, but the authenticity of Pete‚Äôs cry for help cannot be ignored and it‚Äôs transparent that he is truly in pieces. 

He is trying to help himself by setting clear boundaries with Ariana by directly telling her she is not healthy for his life. But upon hearing about his post, she shows up uninvited anyways, serving as a sadistic reminder of his pain, all while simultaneously tweeting about her new song‚Äôs release and cracking an ill-mannered joke: perverting care and concern into persistent, twisted darkness by fueling the fire of media frenzy, like throwing bloody meat into a shark tank. Did she really think her actions were truly going to help him?

Ariana- I understand that writing songs is your own way of coping with life, however, I found your response to Pete‚Äôs message extremely disrespectful, inconsiderate, and completely lacking in class. 
If you truly care for Pete in the way you claim, please try to be more mindful of your public impact by listening to his request for relief by respecting his boundaries. 

So Pete, if you read this somehow, please know that I am praying for your healing and peace. It‚Äôs wildly unfair and disgusting that your suffering is under the pop culture microscope for the sake of others‚Äô entertainment and amusement. You may be a comedian but your feelings don‚Äôt deserve to be violated in this way. 


Pete- Your life is precious. You make others smile and laugh and forget their own worries. You take shitty circumstances and cleverly craft them into something that brings hope back into this ever-darkening world. 
Also, you have made impactful strides in the likes of mental health advocacy- a realm I am personally passionate about- and I‚Äôm so proud of you. 


Please know that you are seen and supported. You are heard. 
Not heard for a script or press release or publicity statement but heard as a humble human being who needs some light during this overwhelming darkness that can be so invasive. 
Your spirit is brave and worthy of happiness. I sincerely hope you find that happiness. 
You truly deserve comfort, peace, and healing. 
"
2 years ago I was in the darkest place possible and I thought the whole purpose of my life was to kill myself in my twenties. I've had a thought I want to talk to someone in a similar situation,"I have a lot of theory and experience on anxiety and depression.

I've had 3 suicide attempts."
Need a friend,"I‚Äôve seen this sub for quite some time, but never posted before. I‚Äôve been feeling very down lately. I feel worthless and unmotivated. I‚Äôm starting to hate my self, I fell like I‚Äôm a burden to the people I love. I‚Äôm feeling hopeless and alone. I used to have few close friends, but had become distant. And the friend I was closest to has stop talking to me. I feel alone and in need to talk to someone. To talk on how I feel and to take my mind off my problems. Thank for reading "
I feel hopeless,"I came up with a list of how the world would be a better place if I wasn‚Äôt in it. I was able to think of 20 things. After that, I tried to come up with how I make it a better place. I couldn‚Äôt even think of 1. I feel like I should just do everyone around me a favour and go through with it, but I‚Äôm too much of a coward to do it. I know I won‚Äôt do it but it‚Äôs all I can think about. I don‚Äôt wanna die, but I don‚Äôt wanna live anymore."
I give up,"My life is a waste. I'm pointless and worthless. I want to stop existing.

I can't do anything right. My thoughts, feelings and concerns are all wrong."
Just a vent from someone who's having a self-loathing and hopeless vision of reality,"Well... We live in somewhat complicated times, which is obvious. However, this is something that I can‚Äôt allow myself to care about. An apathy definitely became an inherent trait of my ego a while ago...

It has been about a year since I published an introspective analysis of my current life situation somewhere on the internet, besides what were the expectations before I decided to see a psychologist, trying to decipher what is tormenting me. Well... I can say that that first attempt was a failure.

I was only able to seek professional help for a brief period before I was fired from my previous job last year, interrupting the process. On the positive side, I was able to organize my professional life a little after that happened. But on the negative side... I could see that my demons being stronger than before.

Today, I'm approaching 30 years old, and given the circumstances, I‚Äôm not the happiest and hopeful person I used to be...

I have no one to blame. No one but myself... Countless wrong decisions have taken me to where I am today. Decisions that admit they can be corrected and put back by myself, thus making a fresh start. But... These decisions were much more severe with my inner spirit than with the others.

Apathy, hopelessness, and hatred... These are things that make me who I am today. The rancor of having to let myself go into this spiral of despair and my self-loathing prevents me from looking for something better... I don't feel worthy to be happy, let alone stop feeling pain. And you know the worst of it? All the eventual calls for me to seek support from other people sounds false to me...

Yes. It is a claim that it will really sound rude, but I have to say:

""I don't trust any of you. I‚Äôm not able to trust""

I‚Äôm sorry for that, as I‚Äôm unable to see any act of affection, empathy, and appreciation. I know that a lot of this isn‚Äôt true, but that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm unable to see...

Things like faith and hope lost the meaning to me, for having become something vague and inconclusive to hold on. Any acts of goodwill strike me as hypocritical and empty, just with the intention of shutting up someone who is about to recover. This world seems so fucked up that it basically causes me zero strength to care for a single drop with it.

Obviously, I am still a long way from acting belligerently, suicidal and sociopathic at this age of crisis, but I‚Äôm tired to wait any longer. The sad part of all this is that I have a wife and a son who I‚Äôm can‚Äôt have the strength to fight for them and keep myself sane... This is truly a Herculean task.

I really think I should shut up about this. Spare people from this senseless anguish... But I'm still human. I don't know if I'm going to stay whole if I can't shout in some way or another.

As for my future? Only time will tell..."
I can't get out of bed.,"If this sounds familiar, please share your tips/success stories. I need all the advice I can get.

I don't have any friends. I work a dead end job because I don't have any valuable skills. I don't have any hobbies, though I've attempted lots of things, only to lose interest. All I do besides work is binge eat and watch Netflix. I do have a loving husband who wants to help me, but doesn't know how. Now it's my day off and I'm still in bed at 2 because I don't see a reason to get up. I hate living like this."
I feel like I need to just say this even though it won‚Äôt mean anything.,"I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry. 



I‚Äôm sorry for not being able to do anything. I‚Äôm sorry for being so helpless. I‚Äôm sorry for making people mad. I‚Äôm sorry for not being strong. I‚Äôm sorry for not being able to make wings for myself and reach my goals. I‚Äôm sorry for being weak. I‚Äôm sorry for not doing anything more. I‚Äôm sorry for doing nothing. I‚Äôm sorry for not helping. I‚Äôm sorry for just sitting here crying, I‚Äôm sorry for sobbing, I‚Äôm sorry for existing. I‚Äôm sorry for everything and anything I‚Äôve ever done. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt love myself. I‚Äôm sorry I disappoint you. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm an empath. I‚Äôm sorry I soak up everyone‚Äôs feelings and implode on myself. I‚Äôm sorry I pity myself a lot. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm so broken. I‚Äôm sorry I hate mindfulness and get stressed. I‚Äôm sorry I draw. I‚Äôm sorry I create. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm such a failure. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm negative. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm positive. I‚Äôm sorry either way. I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm sorry.




But most of all. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not able to do anything to help you. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt give you a hug. I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt meet you. And I‚Äôm sorry it seems nobody cares.



It may not count. But I care. I‚Äôve said this before but I‚Äôll say it again. I care. And I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt do anything more"
I asked out a friend and now I'm depressed and anxious. I don't know what to do.,"I asked out my friend who I've had feelings for (and still do, mind you) and she said she'd date me. Before I asked her out (days before), I had been getting incredibly nervous, and I was feeling anxious, and I didn't even know how I was feeling. I figured it was just nerves, but it kept up afterwards. I don't know why, but after she said yes, I cried for an hour. I didn't have a date in mind, at that point it was eating me up inside and I just had to ask, so it's been a week and I've still barely kept in contact. I've just been feeling more depressed than I ever have, and I've never felt anxiety, but now it's constant and acute. I was planning on a date that week, but instead I went home to get a Fluoxetine prescription from my doctor, with advice to see a counselor on my college campus. It's been 6 days and I don't know what to do. I constantly feel sad, numb, and scared. It hurts, it really does. It's been emotional pain in my head constantly for a week and a half. I still want to date her, everything has gone so well and I've never clicked with someone like I have with her, but I feel so depressed that being around her doesn't cheer me up, it just makes me feel guilty for being depressed around her instead of making her happy, like I usually make every effort to. My friends are all downstairs playing games together, and they're probably wondering why I'm not with them (I told them ""I'll be there soon,"" before scampering upstairs to hide under my covers), and why I've been so withdrawn. I don't know what to tell my friends, and I don't know what to tell her. I don't know whether to tell them all that I've been depressed, so that they don't think that I just don't want to prioritize spending time with them, or whether I should just tell her, or whether I shouldn't tell anyone. Me and her are both 18 and have never been in a relationship or dated anyone before. Normally I'd say wait and see, but having asked her out, the clock is ticking. I'm just in pain and I don't know what to do to make it stop. In the past, I've been able to think my way out of my depression, but now I can't. Before, my anxiety was always based on having something to worry about, but now it's constant and has no cause. I know I'm a smart, attractive, funny guy who's got a lot going for me, and yet everything I've mentioned before this sentence is also true.

&#x200B;

Should I tell her that we can date, just later?

Should I tell her that we should go back to being friends?

Should I tell her we can be friends until I'm ready to date her?

Should I just tell her that I've been feeling really depressed recently, and that's why I haven't made plans? I know I need *some* explanation.

Should I tell my friends what's going on? I don't know if they really care too much, and I bet they're poorly equipped to help. I don't even know what I need, much less, them.

Should I just tell my friends I can't make it tonight?

&#x200B;

I know this is kind of asking for relationship advice, it's a bit of both, I know. I'm more asking for support, as I'm just hurting, confused, and kind of scared. My friends (particularly her) are the most important thing to me, and I don't want them to think less of me."
My Government won't support my parents any longer for having me,"Disclaimers: Never posted on reddit before, but I don't know who else to talk to.   
The grammar will be off because I am quite upset as I type this, my apologies. 

  
Quick backstory: I've suffered from depression ever since I was around 16, now I'm soon-to-be 25. I tried seeing a therapist back when I was 18 and started university. She was truly awful and I thought I had no right to see a therapist. 

Fast forward to january 2019, I decided to try another therapist because I am truly incapable of living in this state. I still haven't finished university. I'm trying but failing. I'm incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. Although I have a job I don't get paid much. I depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon won't have the governments support because I'm too old to count as a child. 

I just found out and I feel aweful. I never wanted to be a burden to my parents. They're not made of money, and although my mom said she won't kick me out, I know she's growing impatient. She's having  a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder. 

  
I struggle very hard not to let the thought of ""ending it all so they'll be better of"" take over. Because I know my mom won't be better of knowing I've commited suicide. I don't want to die. I just can't live.  Does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this?

  
I should talk to my therapist about this, I know. But my next session won't be for another 2 weeks."
Thanks!!,I‚Äôm new on here and I just want you all to know how thankful i am for this site! I felt so alone like things were only happening to me ! I no I‚Äôm not alone anymore
Suicide research study,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study exploring potential protective factors against suicide. You do not have to experience thoughts to take part, as we are interested in the protective factors too.

&#x200B;

Anyone over 16 years of age and fluent in English can take part. If you decide to participate we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you‚Äôre willing to do so) again every month for the next two months. The questionnaire should only take around 20-25 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need.

Some of the questions will ask about current mood, any suicidal thoughts or self-harm. If there is a chance that this could be upsetting, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. If you would like to take part, please click the link below.

Thank you,

How can suicide thoughts be so invasive? I have absolute zero control over them.,"this anguish is making me insane, i'm on the verge of a crisis."
Trying to have energy,"I'm on two different meds for my clinical depression but I still only have a small amount of energy that I have to use up at work making sure I am as normal appearing as possible, so when I get home I have no energy left to cook or clean or do anyting really except maybe minimum requiring things. Like emptying cat litter, putting more food in the fur babies dishes, making sure they have water, grab something to eat (like Dry Cereal or a Pop-Tart or something like that you don't have to do anything to) and setting my alarm for work the next day and making sure I have underwear and everything for work the next day.

So what ends up happening is laundry and cleaning and everything else builds up for the weekend and then on the weekend I spend most of the time getting the house back to a normal person level of reasonable and maybe cooking one meal and then back to the week and having to ration my energy to make sure I keep a job. I have sleep apnea and a CPAP that I wear every night but I'd still don't get the best sleep. I have some mobility issues due to injury from the Army and also being overweight. I'm working on trying to lose weight as well but one limitation to losing weight is finding, even at work, needing the snack to keep myself alert. 

 So I'm wondering tips on how to get more energy despite my depression so that maybe I can get at least a little more done so that my weekends could be more than just using up that energy to make up for what doesn't get done during the week due to my lack of energy."
"Overwhelmed, clutching at straws and losing control of my life...","I don't know why I am even typing this, but I am.  I can't say how I feel because I feel more numb than anything, but this is my status:

&#x200B;

I have become so overwhelmed this fortnight, and my head is a hurricane of thoughts that I can't pinpoint so cannot focus on anything.

&#x200B;

Everything is  a struggle and I am behind in work, house chores, personal hygiene and spending time with my fiance.

&#x200B;

Knowing I am behind is just causing the pressure on my shoulders to increase and is shutting me down even more.

&#x200B;

I have no purpose, I don't enjoy my work, my life rotates around trying to pay for the house and bills each month.  My only goal in my life has been to have kids, but I am 31 this year and overweight and it's just not happening.  I feel like I have no right to be a mother when I get like this and it makes me so anxious that I will never be a fit a parent.  

&#x200B;

I have been with my fiance for 11 years but I feel like I am causing problems because I just can't do things that I should be able to - he has to do all the chores, the cooking and nag me to do basic things like clean my teeth which is so embarrassing for me.

&#x200B;

I don't want to go back on anti-depressants because we are trying for a baby, and I feel to embarrassed to go back to my therapist because I have lost my fight, and depression has knocked me down again.

&#x200B;

I am self-employed and losing the will to do the work which means I don't get paid which adds to the stress of paying for the bills etc.

&#x200B;

...I know I am the only person to sort myself out. I know I can't get an instant ""cure"" for this, and I know what the practical and realistic answer is to my next question but I will ask it anyway because it is on my mind and I don't have anyone else to ask it towards...

&#x200B;

Have you ever had the strength to just up sticks and start fresh somewhere new to give your head a new start?  I'm not talking about leaving my partner, but more my house and work to move somewhere new.

&#x200B;

...it wont matter though, will it?  Because depression is inside you, not around you and until you figure it out yourself you will never escape.

&#x200B;

I really hate having depression."
Does anyone know of a depression help line or a depression chatroom?,I would like a helpline that allows you to text instead of call..
People acting like they feel bad for me is making my depression worse.,"So about 6 months ago something happened that sent me into the worst depression of my life. I already get depression sometimes, but up until a few months or less ago I was ready to kill myself.

I ended up moving back in with my parents (did not want to, I didn‚Äôt grow up in a healthy household and it‚Äôs still not healthy) and quitting my job (about 4 months ago).

I‚Äôm currently picking myself back up. I‚Äôm at the point that I know when I get a new job I will for the most part be back to normal. 

Whenever I talk to my mom about putting out applications and what I‚Äôm doing, she just gives me this sad looking smile. 

I know that my mom/parents are not healthy...honestly I need to move out of here when I can (there are a lot of reasons that I won‚Äôt go into right now). 

But I guess in my state of mind this really bothers me. I‚Äôm trying to get back on my feet and instead of someone there to say ‚Äúyou can do this!‚Äù I get this pity look. I don‚Äôt understand. It makes me go back into that thinking pattern of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt need praise in normal life, but with what I‚Äôve been through/am going through it would be nice to have some positive support.

I don‚Äôt really have anyone else besides my parents right now and one friend that I see occasionally. (Another thing I plan to start working on, making more friends). 

Any advice or suggestions on how to deal with this within myself? (I‚Äôm not interested in trying to change someone else). "
