Can't have sex the same,"I'm in a relationship of 2 years, naturally being together for so long we decided last year to start having sex. Always wore a condom, and naturally figured eachother and ourselves out and grew closer. But we had a scare. She felt nauseous and threw up. Scared the hell out of me so we got a pregnancy test. This isn't the first time we've tested before. She's on birth control but I was still scared shitless. The test came out negative fortunately but every time we have sex I get wordied about the condom and pregnancy and I completely lose my sex drive and ability to keep going. 

What do I do?"
How to break up with a friend in the most peaceful way possible?,"I’d love for us to slide off of each other but the thing is, it’ll probably takes a long long time and I’m not that all patient.

So here’s a little background information:

The reason why I want to break this off with my friend is simple: I can’t stand spending time with her anymore. And it’s just that, plain and simple. I don’t want to be with her, I think she’s annoying and I’d rather my own company, it cost me so much patience to not explode and I don’t want to deal with that anymore.

(We have a history as to why I feel this way towards her, you can look at my profile for reference but there’s a lot of rant and so so) 

Long story short, how do I tell her this in the most polite way possible? How should I manage to react if she storms out or any aggressive reaction?"

The most important thing when texting a girl is you should utilize the phone as a tool to set a date not texting back and forth.

"My dad found my porn, help","So.. I got a virus onto my laptop so my dad decided to take a look, I was at my mums house when he sent my mom a message saying that I had ""Gay crap"" on my laptop. I saw him yesterday after weeks and usually we hug but this time he didn't even acknowledge me, I think he might be grossed out since it was pretty fetish-y and cartoon (yes hentai I know imma weeb)
Help!!!

How to tell my parents I want to get medical advice on my mental health,"I'm using my alt for this because I don't really want my friends seeing this post. I'm a 15 yr old male and I think I may be suffering from anxiety, I don't want to be one of those kids who says they have some metal health disorder for attention but doing my own research I do seem to have some of the conditions associated with this. I've never told anyone this as I've never been very good talking about how I feel. I've been struggling wether to bring this to my parents or not. I feel nervous going to them about it because it feels stupid. Its not that I want a diagnoses I just want to clear things up for my own head. Idk this might be a normal thing and maybe I'm overreacting. I just want a second opinion from an unbiased point of view. Thanks in advance and I'll try give more detail if you want me to."
Golden advice that can help you,"1. If you waste time, you waste life. Time is ticking, don’t waste your life - literally. Do things that truly matter to you.
2. Change what you can, accept what you cannot. This may sound discouraging, but it’s actually liberating. Since you can’t control everything, working on the right things is all you have to do.
3. You’re living in the real world, not a fantasy land. The real world is far from ideal. Be bold, be practical.
4. You could be heavily disadvantaged. You could be born in a poor family or born with disability. Maybe your hard-earned money was cheated. But don’t ever give up. Be resilient and keep moving.
5. Blaming kills you. When you blame your government, parents and friends for your current situation, you don’t solve anything. Instead, you become bitter and get killed from the inside.
6. You are responsible for all your emotions. Good or bad, emotions are generated by you, not radiated to you by the external circumstances. Master your emotions.
7. Most people don’t care about you. They’re more concerned about their lives than yours, and that’s perfectly normal.
8. Love could harm you. Many people are actually harmed, rather than nourished by love. Many harmful actions are done under the name of love.
9. Your parents are getting older. They can’t protect you anymore. it’s your turn to protect them now. Grow up.
10. You may lose health. It’s tempting to sacrifice health for wealth. That’s putting the cart before the horse. Don’t make the mistake - health always comes first.
11. You are going to die. This is a fact, not a curse. Appreciate the person in front of your mirror and live your life to the fullest."
If you need advice I’ve got some for you,"If your a teen and want some key advice about young I’ve got you covered 

Life is way too short and being a teenager doesn’t last long in life and you only have only life to live,so live it your best don’t make regrets with your life and do what you want in life because your on this planet for a reason and nothing can stop that.go with what you think is right and go follow your dreams cause literally anything is possible if you try hard enough 

LOVE:
If you fancy someone but your afraid/shy to tell them 
The best advice I can give you is tell them how you feel and go with your gut,because chances are they might truly like you too and is in the same boat as you they might be thinking “how do I tell him how I feel?”
And if it does go wrong which it probably wont but if it does I do too know how it feels to be rejected or if the person doesn’t feel the same way about you it hurts and there nothing you can do and you can’t make people like you or love you and I wish it did too but love isn’t about grand gestures or destiny it’s dumb luck and sometimes you find someone who feels the same about you and sometimes your unlucky but someday it could be tomorrow or next week or next month but when that tome comes your gonna find someone who feels the same way and appreciates who you are there’s like 7 billion people on this planet there’s so many opportunities out there you’ve just got to go get it.LOVE FINDS A WAY AND ITS WORTH THE WAIT IF IT TAKES LONG

FAMILY:
Family Is all you’ve got,there your blood and they’d do anything for you they’d be there at your best and worst times they’d been there since the day were born. Appreciate every second your with them because you never know when there gonna go.spend every second like it’s the last and family is one of the most important things you will want in life because they’re always there when you need. 


KINDNESS:
Always be kind because It does make the world go round. If your nice to someone the chances are you’d put them in a happy mood and might encourage them to be kind to someone else. There’s already too much hatred in this world and there’s no need for your anger and hatred too because you’d be making this world corrupt.Being kind to someone comes along way even just a small compliment to someone can the world a better place"
Everything’s changing,"I’m 17 and a senior, so you probably have an idea where this is headed. I just came back from my last wrestling tournament with my team, which marked the end of my season. As I got home, I felt so exhausted mentally and physically. I threw my bags on the floor of my bedroom and plopped onto the bed while tears just rolled down my face. I realized that I really had a profound sense of attachment to my team and coaches. I feel like I lost a part of myself. But it wasn’t just a team, they were my family, I come from a broken home where I’m not wanted and everyday of school I’d look forward to wrestling practices. They were people who made me happy to feel alive and the thought that “this is the end of the line” really breaks my heart. I met my now-boyfriend on this team, I just don’t want to lose what I have right now. My boyfriend made me feel so special but I understand we have to go separate ways. Everyone having to move on and start living their own lives. Everything just seems to be falling apart and changing. I’m probably very childish for wanting to keep this sense of familiarity but these people made me feel loved and appreciated and I have this strong sense of love for these people as well. My heart feels so strained today, I just feel so lost and empty.
 This is more of a rant but I’d like some advice if possible."
I’m 14 and I lied about having a gf and a girl with that exact name started at my school,"Hi it’s Dylan I’m 14. So yes I am a Virgin but I have fingered several girls one under the pants and all under the trousers. The older blokes at school like Darren year 12 like to take the piss and they’ve been accusing me of being a Virgin and gay for a very long time (my mate callum is far more of a wanker than me but I think they go after me because I actually have touched clunge and am not an easy target.)

I had enough of this behaviour so I told them I wasn’t a Virgin and they were like “haha yeah right your nan probably bones more girls than u.” And I said “don’t come for my nan I swear on me other nans grave” and long story short I got Aggro and said I had a gf from Scotland named Mary Anderson and she has big tits and loves to suck my knob. By the way this was a lie. 

Anyway this new girl started at our school this year and her name is actually Mary Anderson and she’s from Scotland and yes she has good tits.  Now I could of said “no it’s not her” but I froze up and said that she is my gf. It was too weird to say she wasn’t, then I’d look like I was lying. 

What I’m trying to do is make her my gf without her noticing and then I won’t be lying but that means convincing her to suck my knob!!  She Is nice but I don’t think she will suck my Knob before Christmas. What I could also do is continue to lie about stuff we did and then if she gets cross, say she is just covering to not look like a slag. I could also ask Callum to corrobarate my story and say he saw us boning but he’s a Bellend and nobody would believe him anyways. 

I asked my nan and she called me a cheeky boy and said I should try and slip Mary a fresh one but uhhh consent is a thing nan bloody hell

TLDR I lied about having a gf then a girl with that exact name came to my school"
Advice on crushes?,"   It’s pretty basic to have these but tell me if I’m going about this wrong:

1. Get to know the person 

2. Talk to them consistently 

3. Become friends

4. Ask em out

Is that weird?"
"I’m 13 and I still play with toys, and everyone (including my family) makes fun of me for it. What do I do?","Hello!! I am a big fan of Littlest Pet Shop, but everyone makes fun of me for it!! No matter what I’m into, they make fun of me for it. I like FNaF, they say that game is for kids. I like Invader Zim, they say I’m too old for cartoons. I say I want to cosplay, they say I’m too old for dress up. I like video games, they say I’m a girl and I need to act like it. I just feel like I’m not good enough for them and very immature. What do I do?"
I cant move on,"In November, 2018, I met this girl. I had a connection with her unlike anything I've ever had before. Shes said the same thing. We started a relationship, but it was always awkward. I kissed her on the cheek, but it never came naturally like it should. She says shes tried to kiss me, but it felt weird to her. The same goes for me. I didn't necessarily feel romantically attracted to her. We just had this incredibly deep, platonic bond. And yet, I cant move on. Every time I try imagining myself with someone else, i imagine her. Every time I try thinking of my future, she is in it. I wish I could take a time machine and go back to where our relationship peaked. There's another girl she likes. I dont know what I'll do if she ends up with her. We're still friends, because we both feel like we cant let go of this emotional bond. We just care about each other too much to let go completely, even if it hurts. And it has been hurting. A lot. I dont know what I'll do if I have to see her cuddling with someone else.  We broke off months ago. She doesnt want it to be awkward like it was. She says we're better off as friends, and I agree, and yet i cannot move on for the life of me. Any suggestions as to what I should do? I'm at a complete lost, and have been ever since we broke up."
How do I make existing worth it?,"I feel unmotivated in life right now and I’m not sure if existing is even really worth it. I don’t want to die and disappoint my friends and family, I love my friends dearly. But I’m not satisfied with my life or how it’s looking to turn out. I’m not interested in marrying or having kids. Anyone have any ideas on how to make it all worthwhile?"
I think I’m bi. What do I do?,"I also took a quiz (it was about dysphoria) and it says I most likely have it. I’m so confused,sad,and hopeless all the time. I need help."
Am i in the wrong with my parents,"This is abit long so bear with me 
Okay this is a roller coaster of emotions. So i grew up spoiled. Yes i acknowledge that. Everything I got I wanted. But recently I dont even know anymore

So i recently moved back in with my parents after 6 years in boarding school. I thought after not seeing them since the age of 12 I thought it would be a nice chance to reconnect. Boy was I wrong. 

I just feel like i guest and Its like my parents cant seem to acknowledge anything i do and am i wrong for wanting acknowledgement? For instance i finished AP chemistry with a 99.8% and all i got was okay so what and a god shut up im busy. I got elected student council president and all they said was resign because theyll just use you as an errand girl. But someone my sister getting a 75 is worth going to dinner and cake?!!?!?!?! I just want something and like sometimes ill complain about the work i have to do and they just say stop complaining you chose to do this or why are you complaining we never forced you to do any of this. Which was right but i just wanted a hey its going to be okay

Im just tired of everything. Im tired that my mother cant seem to bring herself to care to remember anything about me. For instance we had this fight about curtains. My mother had asked me and my sisters what colour curtains we would like for our room. i had said white, and no orange ma cause I hate the colour orange. Next thing I know, im getting orange curtains whilst my sisters get the colours they wanted and when confronted she turned it on to me saying she didn’t intentionally do it she just didn’t remember mine and that I was being spoiled and should just be grateful that i got curtains in the first place. Another instance was when I had been telling my family i no longer eat pork for health reasons. I said this repeatedly, made a point to avoid pork, and just made the extra mile to ensure I never ingested pork. I come home and dinner is pork belly. I told my mom I couldnt eat this and I was just going to order take out and she flipped out calling me a brat and ungrateful and saying she kept saying how was she supposed to know what I liked and I just wanted to scream and yell at her telling her that she seemed to remember my sisters preferences just fine

The list goes on with stuff like this and im just tired. I wanna leave my house. I wanna leave and just cut ties with them because i always felt like they just supplemented their lack of love for me with material things and ive tried talking to them and theyre just in constant denial about all of this"
I’m very tired and don’t want to be 16,"Everything tires me so much. Mostly people. I don’t remember always being like this? I used to love hanging out with people and talking to my parents but now i avoid them cause they just annoy me. Everyone seems very happy and I’m not. 

I picked the wrong career path so now I’m never going to end up with my dream job. To get a job that pays well enough I’ll have to do something with economics and that’s depressing cause I really want to do something in the medical field like my mom but I’m too fucking stupid for that.

Also all my relationships are fucking failing. I’m toxic. I’m manipulative. I don’t mean to be but whenever my dad screams at me I feel bad and start crying so he feels bad to which I feel good. It’s very shitty. 

Intimacy scares me and the idea of kissing someone scares me. Or doing something else with a boy in a romantic setting. 

I really hate myself. I hate the way I look, I hate the way I am. Just how I talk disgusts me. I have an eating disorder and am even failing with that. End up binging and ruining that shit too.

Mentally I feel like I’m still a child. Like I never grew past 12. I’m 16 now. Idk how 16 year olds act. Maybe I’m actually normal and the sixteen year olds around me are just acting older idk. I don’t want to be 16 anymore. I can’t handle all the responsibilities. 

I think my parents would be better off without me. I’m such a problem. I eat nothing and my mom feels so guilty for that. I don’t eat meat or greasy foods. The few things I do eat I also don’t eat bcs idk what the calories are. So I throw that away and then she ends up finding her meals in the trash. I try to eat it but sometimes it’s just so greasy I can’t. 

I don’t think I actually want to kill my self. I just need a pause for me to catch up. Everything is moving so fast and I’m having trouble understanding the changes. Sometimes I’m biking and think about how everything would be over if I just bike through red. I wouldn’t worry about how many calories I burned, if my friends secretly hate me and if guys talk to me because they think I’m attractive or because they want to make fun of me behind my back.

I know people love me. That’s the problem."
Why do I cry all the the time,"Why do I cry all the the time

I’m crying almost every day since I remember. It can be caused by anything and often happens in public. It can be a bad mark, someone being mean or even someone raising their voice. Everyone thinks I’m weird because I cry so easily. I cried maybe 3 times watching movies, but when it comes to situations including me I’m in tears much more often. I can’t really control it. I also often cry at home usually because I’m overwhelmed by everything and I feel like I’m failing in every possible way. I had a few panic attacks in my life, but they don’t happen often. Are you able to help me somehow? I’m tired of being like this.

"Im a straight, white, cis male. Help! (?) [Rant]","
First off, I know that I’m probably going to get a lot of hate for this post, but Im asking for advice here, not to be shamed for my race and gender I was given at birth. I also want to say that I do not mean to offend anyone, as I am a strong supporter of women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and right to any and all other groups. I have many friends from all different groups and love all of them equally. I recognize that all of these groups face tons of oppression regularly, and I hate that they do.

Now to the hard part...

I am a white, straight cis male. I am quite comfortable with who I am. I am also hated on regularly because of they way I was born. People say that I don’t know what its like to truly be discriminated against, and they are right. But that doesn’t mean that my feelings can’t be hurt if the gender I was born with and identify as tends to be seen as non-oppressed. I have been told by many people that my opinions or value to society is non-existent because of who I am. These people tend to be major LGBTQ+ supporters or strong feminists, even though I agree with them. My romantic partner is a gender-neutral-ish but significantly more on the side of female (I dont know the proper term) and bisexual person with strong latin roots. I would do anything to protect or stand up for their rights and love them indescribably. However, I also want to stand up for my own social rights and have a voice. I want to have a value to society. So, as a straight, white, cis male, what should I do/say to get through life without being ridiculed?"
"Need responses ASAP, thank you","I’m 15 and I’m in my 4th year of Highschool (we don’t have middle school in Canada). A year ago I met this girl in school that I instantly was crushing on. Months pass and I feel like this girl is feeling me too even tho we didn’t talk much. I found out she started fooling around w/ my friend n that discouraged me from askin her out. Then out of nowhere she overdosed n got hospitalized (paralyzed). I hadn’t been in contact with her during her hospitalization About half a year later when she got discharged n came back to school she had a walking stick n couldn’t walk properly. Her social status decreased n nothing abt her was rly the same. We still talked occasionally but much less. our more meaningful interactions took place on snap,  I still had feelings for her and our convos were awkward but flirty.  I talked to sum friends about my crush on her and they would make fun of her bad walking, which discouraged me even further from asking her out. After a few days straight of texting her, I got a snap from her asking if I wanted to date her. Weirdly It struck me as desperate, like her decrease in social status had made her pick me instead of someone else. at that time I also had a date with a different girl planned. That plus the fear of being criticized about dating  a “cripple” messed with me n i said no. The next day, when I thought of explaining the situation to her as honest as I could, I had found out she was going to be leaving school to focus on physical therapy for her leg. She was out of my life. Nothing came out of that date I mentioned  and skip to now where she hits me up again, just as friends, we talk about our most current romantic relationships which neither are  going well.  We play the 21 question game and I ask her what the deal was w/ her asking me out. She told me that she had liked me for the longest time, even when I was in relationships with other girls. Immediately I asked her if we could continue the conversation in person, (That may have been too sudden n uncalled for). I’m going to see her 2 days from now. I’m a person who prioritized face to face communication. Currently I’m in a friends w/ benefits relationship w/ a different girl but I’m planning on meeting up w/ my crush n explaining to her why I declined the first time she asked me out. Even the parts about her disability affecting my decision. I genuinely like this girl but everything that’s happened is making me unsure. I’d love some advice."
Poopy parents,"So I got my license recently and been driving myself around to school, friends etc, but now my parents want to know exactly where I am all the time. I know it's just for their peace of mind to make sure I'm safe and what not, but I feel like I shouldn't need to do this every time I go anywhere. I said ""that's stupid"" and now they won't let me drive unless I text them my whereabouts all the time. Thoughts?

Edit: Thanks everyone for all the advice, guess I will be paying along for a while."
Does this guy really like me or is he just friendly?,"So there’s this guy at my school, he can literally go up to a random person and talk to them with no problem at all and that’s how we became friends. He has a lot of friends and a lot of the girls like him, he’s not a fboy or anything he’s usually nice to me and friendly. We are in a sport together (practice is usually when we see each other in school) and he would ask to be my partner for the warmups and stuff. He also stays around me more than his other female friends. He knows alot of people liked him and can be a little self absorbed sometimes. A few days ago he asked if i liked him, i pretty sure he asked just so he can boost his ego and stuff so idk if i should tell him or not :/// i feel like he’s just gonna laugh it off and continue being friends"
sometimes I just feel like crying out of nowhere,"I'm 16 and probably depressed, and within the past 6-ish months I just feel like I'm gonna cry out of nowhere. like, I'll just be watching youtube, or drawing, or be in school and I'll feel like I'm gonna start crying.  I've stopped going to the counselors at my school because they're no help.   
I probably have depression, but last time I went to check out if I did was two years ago, and I was told I didn't have it.  now I'm pretty sure I do.  my mom doesn't want me getting anti-depressants because she ""doesn't want me to rely on medication my whole life"" (she's in an essential oil MLM so that probably influences her opinion on me getting meds)  
so, a lot of the time it's when I'm at home that I feel like I'm gonna start crying out of nowhere, but sometimes it's at school.   
I don't know why this happens. and I don't like it when people try to find a reason cause I don't think there is one."
I am a 15 year old girl and haven't been feeling great since October (details below)," Hi. as stated, I an fifteen and in my tenth year of school.

In October my family put our old dog down

In late November my Opa died, last week my family's other old dog was put down.

I used to feel so confident in my relationship with my friends and my academic achievement. Now I feel that my friends no longer need me and that I am not as smart as I used to be.

My Oma died along time ago and with my Opa dying and my old dog dying (gift from my Oma) I feel like I've lost all connection to my extended family, not that there was much to begin with. I am beginning to fake smiles a lot more at school and feel that I have to put on an act for my friends.

to add to this I have been seeing my abusive father around town (he still lives close to my family) and feel that there are certain places I used to love that I can't visit anymore due to fear that he would try to talk to me.

Due to all these things and my own depleting self-esteem I have begun to force myself to throw up. I don't to it to much to be worrying but when someone makes a offhand comment about what I eat (it's not their fault. I'm overreacting) I run to the bathroom and try to make myself throw-up. It doesn't always work and that makes me feel worse.

can someone please tell me how to feel better"
"I have a girlfriend, but I’ve realised I’m gay","I’ll get straight to the point, i’ve been with an amazing girl for almost 6 months, and during that time i’ve gradually realised that while I do have love for her, im just not at all attracted to girls and i just can’t see myself marrying a woman. anyone have any advice for what to do?"
My friend isn't being safe online,"I don't know if anyone will read this but I have no clue what to do My friend and I are 15. Everytime she comes over to chill she ends up facetiming a bunch of dudes. She is talking to a bunch of older guys online.

2 weeks ago she was calling a children's help line asking them what to do because this guy pretended to like her. he convinced her to send nudes then blackmailed her into sending more by sending them to others if she didn't listen. He even found her address.

I thought she had learned her lesson but on Friday she tells me about her boyfriend she met on facebook 3 weeks ago . She tells me he is 17. She's on FaceTime with him when he texts her asking us to make out on camera for him. I called him a perv and then went on with my makeup. I over heard her saying she will send a picture when she disappeared into my bathroom. I told her she shouldn't be sending nudes after what just happened. She says they where not fully naked so its okay. 

Yesterday I decide to stalk his facebook and it turns out he is 22. I tell her to call me asap. She ended up telling me she knew his age and that he was the love of her life. I tell her how sick he is for being Involved with a child. He can get in so much trouble for even having her pictures. I convince her to end it. 

She explains to me she loves the attention from these guys but it's unhealthy and dangerous.

Now today we FaceTime and she was talking about this 18 hear old that is going to wait 3 years till she turns 18 and they are gonna live together and he loves in the states (we are in Canada). Her mom is my art teacher and I'm debating ruining our friendship by telling her mom because I am worried about her.

Idk if anyone is familar with grooming but this guy she talks to gives her free smokes in exchange for someone to talk to but what happens when she gets desperate for smokes and he asks for more than just a conversation. 

She is constantly putting herself in danger and I can't stand to sit and watch anymore these are sick fucks taking advantage of my young, naive, insecure, and vulnerable friend.

If you have made it this far and have any opinions please leave them here."
Me and my sexuality,So ive been thinking im transgender because i kinda feel weird in my body and my characterostics om biologically male but i feel like a girl because im really femenine towards people and such i feel comfortable to be like a girl like wearing female clothing such as skirts dresses and stockings but does it make me transgender
I want to lose weight but im basically the token fat guy of the group,"I’m at the point of my life where I’m getting way to overweight and it doesn’t help that I’m 5’5. I want to start to lose weight but I feel like my whole personality and how I interact with my friends and how they interact with me is that I’m the fat guy. For example. my friends and I made a video the other day and in one of the scenes I die by eating a doughnut, jaws style, then getting shot. the clip ends by the doughnut falling on the floor. I feel trapped because I feel like I’ll lose what I have if I lose weight.

I wouldn’t even know where to start if I even was to commit to losing weight."
I had sex with someone older than me,"Sorry if formatting is bad, on mobile 

So me and this guy met on Twitter, we had a shared interest in the same band so we started talking and it was going well. We talked about our favourite songs and general stuff about the band and other interests. We got onto the topic of where we lived and we realised we were somewhat close to each other, so we decided to meet up. 

So we met up and all was well, we talked about a bunch of things, walked around etc, eventually we got to this secluded place and just had a deep conversation and then things got pretty intimate pretty fast and the next thing you know we were having sex. 

Afterwards i walked him back to the bus stop and as we where going through where i lived he commented about how it looked like a military base, he then talked about how he was going to Uni and then going to join the military or something. I was kind of internally freaking out at that point because i thought he was around my age (15-16) and not 18+. I think he thought i was around 17-18 and not fucking 15, cause he made a remark about me “STILL” living with my parents. 

I have no fucking clue what to do, i feel as though i should just ghost him and pretend like this never happened."
I don't know how to approach a girl,"I'm 15 and she's too. She has been in my class for about 5 jears now and i liked her for about two jears now.  We're good right now, but we don't talk normally and we have different friend groups. 
She's like at least a League above me and two other guys who are in her friend group and they are in her League. I think they like her too and I'm pretty shy.

Am I overthinking?,"Im a quiet guy so I don't tend to speak up in certain situations. However I'm dating a girl online, lets call her Jen. She told me on the phone this story as followed:
She was talking to her male friend (lets call him Mark) when another one walked up to her and tried to speak to her. She said, ""I'm talking."" Which the guy that approached (lets call him Ken) said, ""What? Are you gonna f*ck him?"". To which Jen replied, ""someday"".

How do i forgive myself?,"Hey reddit, I(19M) have a little problem ... It's hard for me to forgive myself. I have a few regrets, mistakes and I am extremely critical of them. I barfed, I hurted people, I wanted some people to die ... Things like that.  Now I don't do anything I used to do before ... I made myself aware of what I did, I didn't do it anymore, I asked for forgiveness where I could, but it still doesn't seem enough to forgive me.

Im grounded but I already was miserable before,"Hi so this might sound a little stupid compared to some of the other posts but hear me out

Last Friday I was invited to a party, I talked to my mom and convinced her to let me go. Seeing as this was my first high school party, I got Shit faced and threw up for at least two hours. My 18 yr old brother had to pick me up because I couldn't sleepover at my friend's house like that. It was pretty embarrassing.  Of course, I got in trouble wich is reasonable, but it makes my life so much harder. I struggle to keep up with my friends and I have a hard time fitting in because Im a lesbian and a little bit of a stoner. I NEVER get in trouble though and my home situation is awkward, my mom hasn't talked to me directly for three days straight. I haven't had my phone for four days.  I snuck my phone last night and saw a text from one of my friends who took me to the party (we don't see each other in school bc track ended) She thought I had been ignoring because I was mad, I tried to explain myself, but I'm worried that without my phone I can't do ""damage control"" I go to a small school and I don't want the wrong people talking about me. I'm the good kid in the family, my other siblings have done some pretty serious bad things and I'm just nervous without my phone

Does anyone have any advice to help me get my phone back without stealing it? I just want to gain trust from my parents, I'm a straight A and B student, I do chores without being asked, and don't usually cause problems... How do I make this work?"

I need help.,"Hello, I’m asking for help because I’m truly at my last straw. I live in a family of 5, my parent my 2 sisters and me. My older sister is very abusive. She is 7 years older than me(im 14). She often screams at me for existing saying “they should’ve aborted you, you fat wh***” and sometimes she goes psychotic and destroys stuff in my room e.g rips my notebooks, spills all my lotions on my desk etc. At this point I’m scared to go home after school, so I signed up for extracurriculars that as long as 1-3 hours everyday. I told my mom about it and she said she would speak to her about it; it’s been a month since and her aggression towards me continues. Please help me, i shouldn’t be scared to come to my own home."

Dont know what to do about this girl,So I'm in 10th grade and in 8th grade I met a girl who meant the world to me. She became my best friend and eventually I developed feelings for her. Unfortunately I'm a very insecure person and I became scared that she was using me as a way to stop herself from being bored. I was scared that she was only talking to me to not be bored but I was too scared to confront her. Instead of confronting her I stopped talking to her completely and I waited for her to confront me. I thought that that would be my only way of talking it out because I was too scared to confront her. Eventually we did talk things out but things were never the same. The worst part is that she had developed feelings for me and was gonna ask me out before I ghosted her. I felt like shit because I hurt the most important person in my life and I missed my one shot at true love. One day I asked if we were still friends and she told me we were but she just hasnt been on social media as much. I responded to that by telling her I felt shitty that things would never be the same and she didnt respond. After that we never spoke again and she ended her social media break so she was back online posting. After months of hoping she would talk to me I blocked her and prepared to end it completely. Eventually I unblocked her but didnt follow her again but the feelings still havent left me. We havent talked in almost a year but my feelings for her are still haunting me. I want to follow her again and try to patch things up but I'm afraid that she thinks I'm a piece of shit and it's not gonna work out. I know this whole situation is happening because I'm an idiot and I did something stupid but I still love her. I dont know what to do or how to fix things and seeking advice here is my last resort.
14F and having an awful time.,"Hi.

I’ve recently realised that i’m scared of talking to anyone. i’m a sensitive and emotional person and even someone raising their voice at me can upset me.

i’m at the point where i don’t put my hand up in class anymore, am scared about my friends/ peers judging me and even afraid of talking to my parents about stuff.

i hate having to feel like i don’t have a voice - it’s really shitty. there’s so much i have to say but everyone at school knows me as the ‘good girl’. also, there’s a lot my parents don’t know that i’m keeping from them and i feel so alone. i don’t feel as if my friends would understand and would turn me away because i would be ‘self-centred’.

I don’t want to keep it bottled up inside me anymore but i don’t know where to turn.

(my pm’s are open if anyone wanna talks)."
How to motivate my overweight teen towards healthier lifestyle?,"My (44 M) teenage son (15 M) is overweight (209 lbs, 5' 9""), he is smart, good at academics, reads a lot, plays video competitive games. He is. Great swimmer and used to swim a lot pre teen. However, now he is not very physically active. 

I and my wife are physically very active and have a healthy diet and gym routine. His diet is not too bad. Generally what we have is what he has. I have spoken to him several times about overweight problems and also  spent time with him in the gym by taking him along. He seems to be not convinced about he being overweight. 

The concern and back and forth on actions for weight loss has been going on for sometime now and I am worried now. Can someone advise how do I systematically approach and help him to maintain a healthy lifestyle?"

I think a girl in my school likes me and I need help,"I thinks. Girl in my school likes me and I want opinions and help please

Hey so I’m a guy and I’m 16, (sophomore) and I think a girl likes me after my friend said he thought so because if any girl I’ve not spoken too much before willing talks to me and wants to she probably does. Although it’s very funny and kinda sad, it makes sense because most girls I don’t know don’t just go up to me and talk to me. Backstory though, she is a freshman and goes to my weekly tennis class, one day she asked me some questions about if I’m Varsity or JV and she said she knew I was from the same school because she sees me all the time. After that she at one point asked if we had practice that week in school while I was giving with friends. Then at practice we had to do doubles and have a partner for the practice and she asked if we could be partners.

The reason I asked this is because too be honest, I kinda do find her attractive cause she is very nice and pretty. Also I’m curious

Also if you think she does what should I do."
nostalgia hurts,"I live in a lower-middle class household in SmallTown, USA. So, vacations are a big deal for my family. Any time we can afford it, we rent this sizable cabin for Labor Day weekend. 

The last time I went to said cabin, I took my first girlfriend with me. We made a lot of memories there. Since it was my first relationship, ever, it is taking me awhile to move on. And so, when I recall a memory, I get quite upset. The cabin contains a lot of fond memories, and I'm afraid of losing my shit if I go with my family this year. I'm afraid of being pitied after telling family members we're no longer together. Im at a loss of what to do. I simply cannot not go there. It would confuse/hurt my family, or both.

I'm kinda lost.,"Hi,I'll just get to it I'm about 18 somewhere between smart and normal(educationally) never cared about having friends,talking to a girl having a social life seemed to be fine by me cuz I thought I must focus on what I wanna be then time for these kinda things would come laterso I spent my life without giving a damn abt social life had some friends every now an then but didn't really care.then now that I get to meet a lot of new people some of whom I find interesting I feel like I can't cope, have a small talk or anything without being nervous,can't really make any new friends,even though I get to know people who are interested in my personality/admire me and they try to get close to me even if I'm interested in their personality as well.i have some good friends but I never felt like we match though they're really good people and care about me.
I feel kinda snervous whenever I'm to someone new and it never felt natural ,The only time it feels natural dealing with ppl I don't know is when I'm doing a group activity (I kinda like competition) like those you'd do at school.
Talking to a girl makes me kinda nervous even if we know each other for a long wire or she likes me.
I don't whether I'm an introvert or an extrovert cuz I could be both,but I'd say mostly an introvert.

I'm not looking for miracles or sth to completely change my personality but I'd like to have healthy social life,maybe your advice/experience help me

this is my first time asking for advice on the internet for advice,kinda used to seem bs to me but I think I might need ot,never asked for an advice about social life from anyone

can i be friends with a recent friend with benefits?,"so i (16 f) have hung out quite a bit with a guy (16 m), and we made out quite a lot over the summer, but we kind of fell apart and now we are just friends.
the thing is, a while ago he said to hang out as friends, and i was doubtful, but i agreed, because he’s a really cool guy, buuut let’s just say i don’t kiss my friends a lot.
now it has been some time since we last hung out (couple of months), and he keeps telling me we have to hang out, and he truly is just such a friendly nice guy, that i’d love to just hang out as friends, and nothing more, but i’m scared the same thing will happen again.
i’m very attracted to him, but i’m also terrified of him and how he makes me feel. i don’t feel ready for a relationship, but i’m aware that’s probably not what he’s looking for, he’s more experienced than i am, and i don’t have any reason to think he actually wants anything serious. but even if he doesn’t want a relationship, i feel like he might want “something” and i definitely don’t want that, because i’ll end up falling for him, and he also might only want to fuck which i don’t want to do with someone that isn’t my boyfriend (mostly a trust issue).
only other option, my favorite, is that he wants to be friends! my friends say im totally naive and there’s no way he just wants that, but he really is such a great guy :( i’d just love to hang out with him and more people so that im not as anxious about it :/
i’d love to hear anyone’s views on this :)"
My mom makes me feel self conscious about my appearance even though I can’t help it.,"So I posted this on the normal r/advice but got no replies so maybe I’ll get some here even though my teen years are over in a few months.

How do I confront my mom who is constantly making me feel insecure about how I look?

There’s a bit of backstory to this but I guess I’ll start with what took place this morning. For context of the story I’m a nineteen year old female, my mom is fifty-two. 

I had just went through the process over the weekend of lightening my hair from a burgundy red to silvery blonde (a tough ass process). I was feeling pretty proud of myself and I really loved how I looked. I was sitting in the living room this morning, when out of the blue my mom asks if I’m going to put on makeup for work. Now, I work at a daycare, more specifically, I’m with the toddlers all day, they could care less what you look like. I essentially tell her this and she proceeds to tell me that it would look better if I did because my acne was flaring up again (it does once a month, gee I wonder why). Honestly,  I had one or two pimples on my cheeks and I wasn’t worried because I knew they would go away in a few days. 

Around this time last year, however was another story, my acne was horrible despite me washing my face constantly, using prescription grade acne meds, everything. Then it just cleared up one day to a normal amount.

Anyways, I told my mom that putting makeup on it would make it worse. This is where she fires off “I just want you to feel good about yourself” and I say that I do feel good about myself but her pointing out my flaws that I can’t help is making my feel bad. I told her her words made me feel bad and she got mad at me. Mad at me! She got up and said something like “I was just trying to help” as she was walking out of the room. 

Not gonna lie, it hurt a lot.

I understand her side that she grew up in a different time where girls my age were expected to be made up at all time. If she can get with modern technology and other modern views, I wish she could just respect my wishes sometimes. 

She’s said other things like this before. When my acne was really bad about a year ago, she told me I needed to put on makeup because it looked like I had cigarette burns on my face (it didn’t remotely look like that). 

It wasn’t until recently that she quit criticizing my body. The only positive thing she would ever say about my body was I had large boobs but then follow it up with something like “it you dropped a few pant sizes you could work at Hooters”. I feel like the only reason she stopped was because she said she felt fat in something she was wearing and before I could stop myself I said “how do you think you make me feel everyday.” Even in sixth grade, at my birthday party, she told me I needed to loose weight because all of my friends were smaller than me.

I just honestly don’t know what to at this point. I am happy with how I look and I know that’s all that matters but it is truly taking a toll on my mental health that my mom doesn’t like my appearance. 

I have tried to address situations where she has hurt my feelings before but she always plays the victim card or she does the thing where she tries to decide she didn’t hurt my feelings and it’s my fault for feeling that way. 

I just need help."
Is my dad abusive or am I over reacting?,"So I'm a f14 living with my dad and brother.

About a year ago my mother split leaving me and my brother with my dad and she moved in with her friend. So at first it was sort of ok just really a shock and I think I may have been in a bit of denial. before my mother left she worked in some mines and was never really here (gone two weeks back 1) two of her days were spent driving and 2 were spent sleeping because its a physically tolling job. When she was home and awake she would spend all day sitting in her chair eating and spending al her time on her phone. She would often criticize how messy our house was and would argue with me constantly. I was dealing with a lot of secret mental health issues and didn't really socialise very well but she certainly didn't even try. This was how it was for a good few years. Then my mother had a cancer scare and sort of went through a midlife crisis. I knew things weren't going well in my parents marriage for quite a while and my mum has some really bad depression. My mum had a really bad time at work because people are bitches so he decided to do something nice for her ( flowers on the bed sort of stuff... it was also her birthday.) So she comes home and tells us shed thought about committing suicide and she needs extra help to get better. I was really worried and sort of took it easy on my hormonal teenage bullshit then the next day I got home from school to find my dad already home and distressed so I ran home and found nothing but a note saying 'sorry I ant anymore' on the table from my mum. I honestly thought shed committed suicide but I found shed taken clothes and calmed down. now things got worse between us, for the first few months she didn't even bother to call or anything and neither did any of her family (my dads side did). when she finally did it was because shed gotten a new boyfriend she wanted us to meet (they started dating 3 weeks after it all happened) I said no, hell no. Then another month past and she hadn't called bcuz my dad and her were sorting out bills and shit. IT was sort of ok for a while, shed take us out shopping or to swim and it was all fun but then she started criticizing my clothing and friends. she actually told me I scrape at the bottom of the barrel for friends bcuz im a loser (in nicer words) and I snapped and told her my friends were scraping for me and that I am a loser with a fucked up family. Then shed managed to clear out all her shit from our house and taken a lot of ours. now this whole time my dads been trying to push me to have a relationship with her and trying to 'stay neutral' while also bad mouthing her. Things got worse and worse until the point I was really depressed and suicidal thinking about or trying to commit suicide. She'd take things that belonged to me for her boyfriends kid without really asking me but I was too anxious to really put up a fight. I eventually found out she was telling people our house was disguisting and that my dad was mentally abusive to her. My dad started drinking again (he was a bit of an alcoholc when I was younger and e isn't particularly nice0 eventhough he had screwed his liver or kidney bcuz of It. He got really mean bcuz of it and started screaming at me and my brother all the time, even throwing a chair at the door and shattering it bcuz I started arguing with my brother. He threatened to hit my brother and me all the time saying we shouldn't start shit until were big enough to fight him, he never actually hit us. Hed thrown me out of the hous for a couple minutes but after each fight hed come back and say he hates fighting with us and that hes sorry but it all felt kind of manipulative. at this point id basically stopped talking to my mum all out but she offered to get an apartment so I could go live with her wich I said no but we started talking again and then we stopped again an dtsarted again and stopped again. anytime I said no to an activity or we got in an argument she wuldnt talk to me for a fww weeks as a sort of punishment. Then Christmas came around and she hadn't talked to me in months and we got into it again bcuz she didnnt talk to me for so long and I asked her how my dad wa so abusive and why she would leave us with him if he was really so bad and she refused to tell me bcuz I was too young but im almost 15. I told her not to talk to me and she hasn't tried to talk with me but now im kind of regretting it. I feel like my dad might be the one manipulating me bcuz ive said things about her that ive heard my dad say and I am rally confused. I want to talk to her but I don't want my dad to find out. What should I do and am I being manipulated? I need to know if telling her to not speak with me was a good idea and should I speak with her again? I'm thinking about taking her up on the apartment offer.

sorry for the long read.

TLDR; my parents got a divorce and I told my mum not to speak with me because she was manipulating me but I'm starting to think my dad is the real manipulator."
"I (17M) am on a 3 years old relashionship with my GF (16F), this year I met a girl (15F) in class and I guess I've fallen in love with her, and so does she. I don't know what to do now and I fked up..","I'm sorry for any english mistakes, it is not my native language...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, I've been on a relashionship with my GF for over 3 years, we're very happy together. We've had some problems in the past but nothing much. 

I never thought something like this could happen, but I'm on my last year of school and there is one Girl on my class...and slowly I started to get closer and closer with her, to a point when she admited that she kinda likes me.

At first I didn't care, but slowly I started to develop feelings towards her...

And for the last 2 weeks, we've been really closed. We started the year always having lunch together, but things started to change since this new year (2020) begun...

We started to get closer, to actually hold hands from time to time, we eventually even started to hug recently...

I know this is wrong...I've got a GF and I'm developing feelings for another girl...but I just can't stop it. My GF also does not have any clue of what's happening between me and the Girl...

I really like this girl. Last week I told her that I love her and she replied back. We spend a lot of time alone.. (we never kissed, just hugs and touches \[hands\])

She always reminds me that I've got a GF and if I want to stay with her (the girl) I would've to make a decision (break up with my GF), but the thing is...it's hard. And I don't even know if thats really what I want. I spend many weekends with my GF, at her house, with her famaly. I don't know if I would have the guts to just end it all, there is just so much history between me and my GF that the thought of just ending it all at once hurts me so much that I have no idea of what to do...

&#x200B;

Today I fked up hard, we (me and the Girl) were going to the center of the village by bus (to take each a train to get back home from school), and at the bus stop (where we had to quit), my GF was there (she was going to take the next bus) and well, I just got out of the bus, kissed her and said I had to hurry to my bus, meanwhile the other Girl she was already moving towards her train (I was not surprised by her reaction), once I finally cought with her, she basically told me to not follow her and she hurried to her train (her eyes were also red), I know what I was doing, I fked up hard...

&#x200B;

I sent her a text apologizing, I know it doesnt change a thing but yeah...

&#x200B;

She replied as I'm writting this (40 min after I apologized by text) saying ""Don't talk to me right now"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I never thought I would ever write something about my life on reddit, but here I am asking you for help...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Should I break up with my GF, and start something with the other Girl?

Should I just forget this Girl?

I legit do not know what to do. Any help is welcome

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

tl,dr

I (17M) started to like another Girl (15F) from my class, considered breaking up with my 3 years old relashionship with my GF (16F) in order to stay with the Girl, but don't know if breaking the last 3 years of life over a ""quick crush"" is the wisest thing to do. And I'm lost."

I need a solution,"Hi so I have a question and I really hope someone can help. So I am usually a really nervous and anxious person. I would always but my nails, scratch myself and pick on my cuticles stuff like that. Just last year I had started self harming to cope with my stress at school. I recently stopped biting my nails and harming it was hard but I manage. I have found a way to cope with myself when I’m anxious. I’ve started pulling out my hair. I pulled out my hair on the middle of my head. And now I have a baled spot. I’m really embarrassed of it and don’t know what to do. I sound stupid. But for now I have to take my hair up which I also hate doing bc I’m insecure. Can anyone tell me how to grow hair back into the bald spot? Or even how long it will take? I will really appreciate it. 
Hiii it’s been more than a month since I made this post and I have been wearing the same hairstyle so no one can notice. I’m rlly getting desperate and jus want to wear my hair down does anyone have any methods so I can grow back the hair. Also thanks for all the support!"
Hesitant to Start Birth Control,"Hi all,

I’m a girl and i’m 17 y/o. Recently I decided I wanted to start birth control and have been given the prescription to pick it up at the pharmacy already. But i’m kind of scared to start it. I’m afraid it will mess up my period cycle and possibly give me side effects such as harsher cramps etc. I don’t really know if I should start it. This is a completely optional thing that I had originally thought of myself but now i’m weary about it. My boyfriend doesn’t mind if I take it or not and says it’s up to me because ultimately it affects me but I just don’t know how it could possibly change my body and if it’s a good decision to make. 

I’m hoping to get some advice or just find how it has affected anyone else, Thank you in advance."
How can I get away from my toxic parents?,"I need some real help that might even need to be legal help. I’m 16 years old, and ever since a young age my parents have had a competitive relationship when it came to me. First off the only real reason they got married was because my mom found out she was pregnant with me when her belly started to show even though she was very skinny. I was mostly raised by my grandmother, who taught me manners, helped me with homework, and told me how beautiful I really was. My mom, however, wanted me to be perfect and slim and perfect. I was always chunky, so every time we’d go for our yearly doctor checkup she’d say that I’ve been eating a lot and put me on a diet. Every year. For a very very long time. She also wanted me to be athletic, and got mad when I’d often get bored with sports, didn’t make friends quickly, or wasn’t trying my best. I had asthma as a child so running and jumping wasn’t really ideal, but my mom would just tell me to puff on my inhaler and go back outside. I get fatigued easily, and so under the hot sun for hours without breaks I would start to see spots and black out, and mom would think I was faking so I could go home. She was mad I wasn’t her perfect pageant queen. A 97.6% grade wasn’t good enough, it should all be 100% A’s and she would pick apart everything. She would make my best seem like not good enough, and make me feel really self conscious. My dad was barely ever there so he was almost like a stranger in my house and me and him were never tight. He’d be on the PlayStation, hanging with friends, or at work. A lot of my problems would get ridden off by them until they wanted to invade my privacy, flaming that the reason I was upset sometimes was because I was doing something bad instead of what I told them. They got a divorce a few months ago and a restraining order but have still not stopped fighting, and often make me choose who I want to be with, and put me in the middle of their arguments and try to make me justify their own beliefs. It has now seeped into my social life where if I’m not home on the exact time they said they told me to come by (even though they never said anything at all until they were unsatisfied with how long I was gone) and they blame the other for the rule and how they’re “the cool parent” and I have to cancel some theatre rehearsals to fit their schedules because their matters mean more than mine. 
This has been going on long enough and they have taken everything I have needed for a long time now and have pushed it to the side, saying the other needs to do it, the other needs to pay for it, the other needs to take you. I can’t even get my permit without them fighting, or go to the doctor without making my grandma put her foot down and say enough. I don’t know if I could live through another 2 years of this and was wondering if there was a safe way to legally move into my Mimi’s (grandmas) without my parents freaking out. Where I could get my stuff out of my room and move it into my room at my grandparents without mom saying no and trying to block me from getting my property, and where I can finally live in peace. Please help me."
I'm 15 having trouble with socializing with people. How to improve?,"I'm 15M in my freshman year and am having trouble socializing at my high school. I haven't done terrible but school isn't great. Talking to people, whether it's guys or girls, scares the shit out of me. If a conversation isn't started by someone else, then I find it so hard to talk to anyone. And if thats not so great, talking with girls who I find attractive is much much worse. Usually if I even talk to them l flounder, I have no idea what to do and am always afraid of coming off as weird, annoying, or creepy. I was wondering how I could be a more open person and improve my terrible social skills."
How do I convince my mom to let me get the HPV vaccine?,"(Typing on my phone, apologies for any mistakes) I’m a 15 year old girl and at my last doctor appointment, my mom told me to look at the information they gave me and read over it to see if I wanted to get it. The problem is, she said in That Tone, which means “if you don’t choose what I want I’m going to change my mind and get mad at you for even Thinking about the other option and not let you do it.” Please don’t tell me that I’m overreacting, my mom waited until I stained my underwear to tell me about periods, and even then she gave me the minimum info and told me “oh well I thought that you’d just hear things from kids at school or something. She didn’t tell me anything about puberty, I had to find a book in the library. She still hasn’t given me the Talk (kinda grateful for because it would be extremely awkward) and what I do know I learned online, especially about doing it with a girl. She wouldn’t let me get a mug that said “bisexuali-tea” because it said “bisexual,” and said that she wouldn’t be comfortable seeing it, and that it’s more like a gift you’d get at 18 or 21, or a bachelorette party. Anything relating to s*x, she immediately deems as awful. Is there any way I could get it without her consent? I live in Washington State, and I don’t have the ability to put money on my card or withdraw money without her approval, and any money I make goes straight to my bank account. I currently have $90 on my card, would that be enough? I’m sorry for all the questions, but I’m not sure what to do. It’s dangerous out there, and eventually I’ll start going places on my own or dating someone, and anything could happen. I want to be prepared"
Girl Advice Help!,"Hey. So I’m a 17 year old male and I am in high school. I have a serious problem talking to girls. I am just so nervous around them and I feel like whenever I talk to them they think that I’m ugly or something. I work as a cashier for a part time job and whenever a girl around my age comes in I become a nervous wreak and mess up my job. (Asking if they want a bag more than once, saying have a good night when it’s morning, etc.) So I’m wondering if anyone has any tips for talking to girls? I’d appreciate the help thanks!"
Why is this shit alowed,I went to 4chan to see how somone posted a thread of man comitting suicide.How can this be legal and is it legal to watch this stuff? Also does 4chan count to the dark web?
I’m failing math and it could ruin my entire high school plan! What do I do?,"I have tried in math. I have a tutor, I go extra help in lunch but every test I fail.

I don’t know how to help my girlfriend,"Using a throwaway for this one. 

So my whole friend group (13 year olds) are like depressed, out of the four of us 2 are diagnosed with depression  and stuff, I see a therapist and have gotten out of my depressive state by myself and my girlfriend struggles with depression-like stuff. 

The thing is, I’ve recently started not caring about anything suicidal my friends say. I fucking hate it when people make suicidal jokes and stuff because it kinda triggers me? I don’t know honestly but it annoys me, especially when my girlfriend makes them and I’m like “well you should see someone” and she just makes reasons why she can’t ask her parents to see someone and other shit that makes me think that she doesn’t want help. I’m not spilling the tea on her about “how she’s faking depression” or anything.

Another thing which I need help with is that (we’re both female) she’s really worried about people thinking or knowing we’re dating??? And she goes on a whole rant about why I can’t hold her hand or hug her in public or I can’t even rest my head on her shoulder. I completely understand that she isn’t ready to come out to her parents and stuff but the thing I try to tell her is that most people will just think that we’re good friends or something. It’s like if we weren’t dating it would be completely different if I try to lean on her.

So the thing that I need help with is how to get her help when she just won’t let me try to help, and also how I can tell her she’s overreacting with how cautious she is when it comes to contact.

I really really like her so much but I’ve thought about breaking up, but I can’t because I’m scared she’ll hurt herself or kill herself if I break up with her. Please help me."
I feel like I’m out of options for a person to date,"So I’m 14M coming up on 15 and I’ve been in a couple relationships already. I feel kinda stupid saying it but there’s a certain type of girl that I like. It’s hard to explain what it is that makes a girl attractive to me but I can tell if they have that characteristic or not by talking to them. And it’s really hard to find someone like that. Everyone at my school is wrapped up in fake drama that they all keep going in circles with, and they all look for these fairy tale ride off into the sunset kind of relationships, and that’s just not real. I’m thinking of just waiting until I’m older but I don’t know if I should just count myself out like that. Sorry for the long post but thanks for reading."
my genitals,"so i have been dating this girl for a couple months (were in high school) and sooner or later its going to be taken to the next step, however, I’m uncut down there and i don’t know how she might feel about that because i know its less common and some girls find it gross."
my social circle has crumbled because my best friend dated my other best friend’s ex in secret for 6 months,i just need some help because i’m really struggling. i’ve realised how disposable i am to almost all my friends. i don’t want anyone from school to recognise me so PM me if you’d like.
This is so bad,"My boyfriend who is 37 admitted to my 17 year old daughter that he was attracted to her. My daughter who was molested by her stepfather after he raised her from a baby is uncomfortable and upset at this comment. She was seeing my boyfriend as a father figure. He apologized and and said that although he admitted that she is attractive he would never act on those thoughts. He is sorry he ever mentioned it and everything is awkward. He said he would help us get our own apartment and that he loves me but he also feels bad that he made everyone feel uncomfortable. I asked my daughter if she wanted to move and she is confused and just wants to think. 

I don't know how I feel either. I understand that he is sorry and embarrassed. And I would do anything to keep my daughter from feeling that she can't trust him. 

I love them both. I'm praying that we can all talks and get passed this but I also know there is a good chance that we may be breaking up and going our own ways. 

Is there a way back to happiness from here or should I just walk away from all of this. My daughter will turn 18 and leave for her own life in a few months. But can I be happy with a man who says he thinks she is attractive because she reminds him of a 20 year younger me.  

Seriously confused"
"a girl said she liked me, but i don’t like girls","i (13f) received a text message while i was on vacation from a fairly(?) recent friend of mine, that was extremely long, detailing how she had a crush on me and stuff. she came out to me towards the end of the year and i was supportive, and so were all of our other friends. so it’s the first week of july, and i’ve been friends with this girl since the end of may. so i thought she hated me because i spent an entire dance with my close friend since grade primary, and she had a crush on him. somehow we ended up friends. at the time she texted me, i was running out of data, but was on wifi. i texted some other friends and she had become almost obsessive... like being bi and having a crush on me was her entire personality. she went to the movies with a group of girls featuring my best friend and asked all of them if they had gotten a text from me, and told them she liked me... yikes. so i ran out of data and didn’t have wifi for the next few weeks. when i got home i told myself i would text her, and made drafts in notes, but i never sent them. i didn’t know what to say, i barely knew this girl. she even forced other people to tell me to text me back. at the beginning of the school year she wouldn’t even look at me, and made other people come up to me to force her to talk to me. now she’s always looking at me awkwardly and idk what to do. we weren’t even close in the first place so i’m rlly confused. idc if no one responds, i just need to rant."
is my dad sexually abusing my brother,"i have had such an odd feeling around my little brother (7) and my dad. but my mom went out of town this weekend and i caught my dad and brother in the bathroom with the door locked. it took them a minute to get the door open and it just hasn’t sat with my right. now since my mom is gone my brother is sleeping w my dad in his bed and it sits with me badly too. there have been other situations where i thought there was something wrong happening between them but i always drop it because it’s my dad and we go to church so why would he. than i started reading signs of sexually abuse children and my brother 
- HATES taking off his clothes (even for showers or changing)
- my dad has always favorited my brother buying him treats. taking him places alone 
- my brother has huge anxiety mainly social and he’s 7

i don’t know i just can’t figure out why a 48 old year man would lock himself in a bathroom with a 7 year old. "
Friend Advice,"How do you know if one of your friend's is irritated by you. I get the feeling that one of my friends just doesn't like me anymore, but he's to nice to tell me.  I don't want to bother him, but I don't want to ditch him if he's just been having a string of cranky days."
"I feel alone in this situation, not a good start to highschool either.","Hey there. I haven't been feeling so well. I used to care and give all my passion and love to someone. Someone that became very special to me. Last year, this person started treating me very badly. Losing this person was like losing what I wanted and strived to be. Now it feels like I gave everything away. There's nothing left inside except sorrow and desperation. My body has become useless and my soul is scarred. The mind itself is contemplating scenarios to fix something that can no longer be fixed or helped. That person gave up, they don't care. Why am I still waiting around for them? Why is there still hope inside of my heart? I don't understand why I still have these dreams. I just constantly dream and fantasize. I need to stop this obsession. Giving and caring is what I want to be. Yet, I just work for him. I just wait for him. Putting my emotions and mental health in constant danger, like an indirect suicide attempt towards my mind. I ask myself this question every day, why are you doing this for him? Just move on. What should I do to help myself?"
I need some advice here, So there's this girl I like but I know we could never be anything more then friends .

So I need advice  on how or what could help me move on
Help with energy and talking to people,"Help with energy and talking to people

I struggle to interact with people without going very over the top, talking too quickly and just being too hyper. I think it’s because I worry too much of what people think of me (I’ve tried to stop but it’s difficult) It’s really really draining, I get headaches if I have to talk to people for too long. I just want to be able to talk to people without using all of my energy but at the same time not appearing rude."
How do I go from being in a relationship with someone to friends with benefits??,"Im 16, female, in high school, and I have strong feelings towards this guy. We were dating but with school he says he’s too busy for a relationship. We still have s*x and I still really like him so it just makes me feel sad.. is there a way to help me get over him? Or at least help me go from a relationship with him to just friends?"
My girlfriend's password is her exes anniversary date,We've been dating for a while and she gave me her password as a sign of trust. I didn't ask for it and I've never used it. But then I realized that her password is a date and it's her and her exes anniversary date. I haven't brought it up to her but should I tell her to change it?
How do I tell my friend to get her shit together,"Some context: I recently moved halfway across the world to attend portage university in the US. My best friend from high school moved to another private university just an hour so we meet all the time. 

I should also mention that we took a pretty hard course in high school (IB) and she did not pass on her first try, she has to rewrite a few of her exams and joined in the spring semester. 

I've always been more focused on school, maybe a bit too much, and she's kind of the opposite. She's also extremely social, and I find it harder to come out of my she'll. But in every other way we get along perfectly and I couldn't imagine not being friends with her. 

Since she's attending college with no aid, and she's not extremely rich or anything, her parents have had to pull quite a few strings to be able to send her to school here. I'm extremely close to her family and I know how proud they are to be sending her here. 

Anyway, now she recently told me that she's taking only 3 out of 4 classes this semester even though her parents are paying the full price and she's not going to tell them. That's 11,000 dollars being wasted. I'm so disappointed in her because I know how much effort her parents are putting in to pay for her schooling. She's being extremely ungrateful, and behaving like a spoilt brat in my opinion, especially considering how she barely even passed high school. My parents only sent me to university in the US on the condition that I got a scholarship, and I would be BEYOND grateful if I was in her position.

I just want her to value what she's being given, and take her education seriously. I really want her to do well in life, and right now I don't see her heading in that direction at all. I don't know how to tell her all of this, even reading it back now I sound so preachy. The one time I tried to have this conversation with her she told me I was putting her in a bad mood so I stopped. 

I feel terrible for thinking so poorly of someone I value so much in life. She's also doing much better socially while I've completely isolated myself this semester, which I don't totally mind, I like being on my own. But I wonder if I'm subconsciously jealous and looking for reasons to put her down. 

Please tell me if my feelings are valid, and if yes, how should I approach the situation?"
Why do I feel like I have no-one to trust,"At school I would say I’m popular like everyone knows who i am and i have lots of friend but i don’t have a best friend the last best friend i had changed ever since we started high school she started swearing and bullying other people and i didn’t know where to go to when i go to my parents i feel like if i say some thing about my things that are going on they wouldn’t get it they are definitely supportive I’m just not sure what to do


The closest thing that i have to best friends are a bunch if girls who are very nice but i think that I’m invisible to them because when we are eating with each other in the canteen they never talk to me they only say hi and how are you and that’s pretty much it

If anyone has any advice please help"
Parents,"Is it normal to be nearly completly disconnected from my parents?
It's like we have 0 common interests, I disagree with most of their views, and I feel as if I can't tell then anything serious. It's as if I rent a room from 2 people who live in the same house, and I barely see them, they rarely talk to me. And I'm just completly disconnected from them.

Any advice?❤🙂"
Best friend problem,"So a while back someone I thought was my friend started a rumor saying that I said my crush was a whore which I didn’t I just ignored this thinking it wasn’t worth it and today he told her that I said she had fake deppresion which I didn’t and I got mad because he has done these things before and neglects me all the time

Keep in mind I’m a nerd and don’t have many friends he was one my only two and my other friend just follows him around and does whatever he wants at my school it’s already hard enough to be a nerd and now my friend treats me like this I just need some advice on what to do"
Is there something wrong with me?,"Ive recently been off of school for 1 week and ive found that i crave human interaction, but i end up doing nothing for the whole time as my friends arnt down to ever do anything (theyre not avoiding me, we are like the internet nerds kind of people ) and i say to people what did u do during the week off and their answer is similar to mine, but i feel as if i should do something with friends every single day, not only that but i also want to do things every single day. Am I too hungry for Human/friend interaction or am i fine and shouldnt really be doing anything during this time but relaxing. I know it also doesnt help that its winter and i live in an area with little to do but i can see this happening during the summer aswell.

Any advice or opinion at all would be greatly appeciated
Thank you ❤"
How do I stop being jealous of my two good friends,"Hi I am F(19) and have two awesome friends let’s call them Red and Yellow. They are smart, beautiful without trying and social people. Red and Yellow for lack of better terms are busty in the right places and Red is really athletic. They both have boyfriends and many people ready to chase them. They also both have tons of friends while I only have them really that I talk to.

I don’t have many friends, not as curvy, and during many social event I have noticed people frolicking to them admiring their beauty and makeup and I usually just get a hi op.

I have never had a bf and constantly feel like a third wheel and insecure about myself when in social situations but when I am just with them I feel very loved.

I really hope to get rid of this jealousy cause I know i is not a good attribute to have. How can I do that in a way where no one gets hurt?"
High School Senior need advice,"So as the title says I am a senior in high school. Throughout my high school experience I have been a relatively quiet and reserved person who kinda hung out on the edge of the ""main bubble"" of people at my school. For the entirety of my 4 years I have kept pretty much the exact same friends that I have been hanging out with since middle school and I absolutely love them and would do anything for them. However recently, a couple of my friends from my group have really found themselves a lot deeper in the main  bubble and have begun talking to other people and even have gotten girlfriends as a result. Personally I could not feel happier for them and find enjoyment just talking with them about there experiences and such. I feel like it's important to note I am not scared of them moving away from me as a friend so that is not my problem. Due to seeing two of my best friends have this entire other life it seems like it has begun to make me feel quite lonely and left out. I want to try and get into the bubble somehow or just a bubble, but I feel as a senior it is kinda hard to move my way in as the friendships seem to have been found and developed already. I have talked to my two friends about this and it feels like there is not much I can do. The reason they got into the bubble comes from them being invited to a couple of get togethers    
a person or two that were in the bubble already. I feel like for some reason I have not been able to get that kind of opportunity, most likely due to something I have done or haven't done. My friends have told me that they feel I have begun to change personality wise and have started to become more social as a result which is good. I just want to be able to make my last semester of highschool great and maybe have the opportunity to take someone to prom. I also want to break my cycle of waking up, going to school, going to extracurricular, going home, playing video games/homework and sleeping. I was thinking about asking my two friends that are in the bubble to maybe try and invite me to a couple get together opportunities and see if I could Integrate myself in and become a part of the group but I feel like that is too much to ask and if they wanted me there they would have already invited me. I was wondering if anyone had any advice about what I  should do and how they would try and deal with my situation if they were me. Sorry if this post seemed all over the place I have wanted to get a lot of stuff off my chest and needed to say a lot. All comments are appreciated."
What am I supposed to do about my crush?,"I'm a girl that's a freshman in high school. I've liked this guy in my class for a few months. However he's very shy/quiet and always hangs out with guys and never with girls, which makes it harder for me to talk to him. I've had conversations with him here and there, and I know that we have some things in common (like the bands we listen to, or this one show we watch). 
I don't know for sure whether he likes me or not, but I do know that he isn't going to make a move even if he likes me. So I've been thinking about telling him how I feel on the last day of school before summer break starts. I am actually not worried about getting rejected, I'm mostly doing this for myself, but what I'm worried about is the possible awkwardness when sophomore year starts.
 So far, everybody has told me that I shouldn't be anxious and just tell him how I feel and maybe he wants to know me better, but I can't decide. Should I tell him? Or should I just drop it since he doesn't seem to be interested in anyone?  Thank you so much for the advice!"
Frustrated with friend,"Hello! I’m a 14F. (and new to reddit!) I have a big issue in school that has been going on for about 2 years now with my friend. My friend (aka ‘C’) is a very shy and reserved person whilst I’m outgoing and confident, so we are very different. Since the summer of 2017, she has been getting clingier and clinger to me as I begin to talk to more and more people. I don’t usually have a problem with this, but it first turned into silence when I tried to involve her in a conversation (which I can understand if she’s nervous) to whenever I talk to someone that isn’t her, let alone look at them for more than 5 minutes, she gets angry and storms off looking like a tomato. 

There was an issue back in the summer (2017) when we met a girl who moved into our tutor, but it was the usual school drama - trying to act cool, etc. She was very involved in out friendship circle, but ever since she left, C has been a broken mess that only keeps going downhill as time flows by. At first, I tried being understanding, considering this is C that I am talking about, she might’ve told something private to the new girl. I patiently dealt with her mini temper tantrums for a good while, when eventually all of her wailing and crying turned into loads of messages every. day. I’m not actually very good with texting, so I’d try my hardest to type back, but, as bad as this makes me sound, it wasn’t fun or anything. It was just questions after questions, literally as if she typed up “how to have a conversation over text!” There was even a time when I actually picked up one of her hundreds of calls after school and when i tried actually talking to her, I would just get cut off by more weird questions like:
“What colour is your room?”
“How many sketchbooks do you have?” (I like drawing, so this isn’t too odd I suppose)
“Can you send me a picture of that?”

I know it sounds odd. It makes me feel really bad when I look back at it. But eventually I just stopped picking up or responding - they were boring and repetitive. Eventually, I met some more people. (who I now am very close with) When we talk, she just stands somewhere behind me and stays quiet, and when we try to include her, she just says “I’m fine.”

Recently, I’ve also had another one of my friends (M) try to turn on me by spreading rumours. (I’m likely to post about that later!) I can say I’ve dealt with that confidently, but C and M keep trying to make fun of me behind my back. M keeps trying to say snarky things whenever I say something and C just backbites and spams me with texts. Whenever C texts me now, I just immediately go angry. I’m being patient with them and continuing like normal, but I don’t know how I could make this stop or even just deal with this. I would really appreciate advice!"
I have crush on my friend sister,"Hello I’m 25 and i have a crush on my friend sister,it look so beautiful and cute,she has about 20 year old,yesterday i talked with her i was drinking.now i need advice on this issue, when I see her i wish if i could talk to her and told her that I like her to much."
Should I be annoyed?,"I’m not sure if this is to personal for this, I don’t usually post on these a lot so I’m sorry if it is. I’ve had problems with this in the past with ex-friends and even sometimes random people but I’ve never really been affected as much as I have now as my supposed ‘best friend’ is the one doing it. I (f16) have never had a boyfriend and the most I’ve done with a guy is hold hands. One of my friends (f16) hasn’t even done that (not that that’s a huge deal but you get where I’m coming from) yet she still thinks it’s okay to judge me for not wanting to have sex yet and barely wanting to have my first kiss. Although in the beginning it was a lot more light hearted, lately she’s been a lot more blunt with that saying about how my boyfriend will be annoyed at me and implying that I’ll be a bad girlfriend. Am I overreacting or is this something to actually get annoyed at?"
My personality adapts and mirrors that of my peers,"Okay, i don’t really know the best way to describe this. i’m a senior in high school and depending on my social setting or which group of friends i’m with my personality severely changes and it’s not a conscious act that i’m making it’s just what it is. Basically, my need for advice comes from the fact that i’ll be graduating soon and plan on having a grad party which i will have to invite all of my closest friends to, this is where the biggest personality splits come from, and i’m kind of scared if i will be able to function with both ends of my friends there. idk what to do please help

example, say i’m with friends A and i’ll act obnoxious, cracking jokes, basically never serious and kind over the top. however, when i’m with friends B i’ll be more laid back and chilled out, ready for a conversation about existential crisis or whatever it may be."

Recently when ever my best friend comes over She just sits on her phone face timing and texting random dudes she has online and ignores me. I tried to tell her now it made me feel when she does this but she ignored me so I told her she can go home and talk to who ever she wants in private. She left and blocked me and we haven't spoken since Sunday. Yesterday I fly d out she is now dating my ex boyfriend that sexually assaulted me and she is now telling people that i lied about him doing it. My ptsd has been through the roof and I have had a few breakdowns. Last time one of my friends ignored my pleas to stay away from him she was also assaulted. One of my other friends knew a girl that killed herself because He had done it to her as well. His mom is a social worker and he gets away with everything. Even the cops defended him when they took my statement. I don't know what to do with how angry and scared I feel."
Im probably going to get beaten the fuck out of tomorrow what do i do?,"
Hi, i just turned 14 and i have been manipulated by someone for over a couple of years now and i can’t do anything against him because he has like a gang or something. So let’s get on with the story He made me buy him brand new air force 1’s and what i got in return was some used nike air max 270’s it was those were it said allah in arabic. (He is muslim) I didn’t really mind bc there just shoes, and i know they cost more but they were probably just stolen. The nike shoes didn’t even fit me. (This was some weeks ago) forward to today, he called me and said that he needed them back i said no because it wasn’t even his shoes anymore. He said he needed the to get something for himself.He tried to lie to me by saying that his mom wanted them back so i asked to speak with her. She said that it was you’re choice to keep them or not and he didn’t really like that too much. And now he is saying that he needs them back bc it says Allah on them and he will do anything for Allah to get those shoes back. He said that him and older people are going to jump so i don’t know what to do"
"so me and my girlfriend are 14 (we are both about to be 15) and we are in a long distance relationship, and the age of consent here in kansas in 16, so will it be okay for us to engage in phone sex when we are 16?","we’ve done it twice before but on the second time we got caught by my mom about a week ago, I didn’t get punish, but if we do do it again we won’t really be able to talk again and I don’t want that to happen because I love her very, very much. My mom said that because she doesn’t want us to take the path she did and since 16 is the age of consent I’m not exactly sure if it would be okay then"
My girlfriend came out and I need a bit of help,"My girlfriend of four years (been together since we were 14) came out to me as gender fluid. I know this sounds stupid but we have been talking about having kids recently and what that would be like. And now I'm scared that's not going to happen.. She said she only sometimes feels like a guy but she doesnt know if that's her just being masculinely gay cause shes also poly so the gay jokes are strong with her all the time. I already told her that I would love her no matter what and no matter who she was but I dont want to be with a guy or even someone that's sometimes a guy. I've been laying in bed just staring as the ceiling thinking about every bit of the future we talked about dissapearing while shes asleep on the phone. I want to tell her that I dont want to be with a guy because of my parents being religious, my friends calling me gay and shit, and just being looked at differently when I'm around her but I dont want to make her feel like a mistake. Otherwise I really wouldn't mind if it meant I got to still have her in some way. Even if its not who I've known for a good portion if my life. If I'm missing something about gender fluidity please explain more and if i could get some help on how to break what i just said to her or even how to cope with possibly losing what we have that would be great

Thanks. 

Also this is a throw away so friends that know my actual account dont see this."
Is it possible to change how someone feels about you?,"I (14m) have a crush on my bestfriend (14f) and she knows it but doesn't feel anything towards me like that. We are able to call eachother names and laugh it off which I love and she helped me through so much shit ever since I met her, so if anyone knows ways to convince someone then please help"
“Stop being passive”...🖕🏽,"So about a hour and a half ago me and my mother was having a regular conversation about a media topic. We don’t have the same view and I stuck with my opinion and still do. She started to get mad so I just left, she then comes to me and say “stop being passive”, “idk what you think that does for you”, “I don’t know where you got that from”, “it doesn’t help you and isn’t a good look for a men”. I see myself as someone who just don’t entertain bullshit. AT ALL. I don’t see it as being passive although I can admit I don’t show emotion at all. I’m stuck on what she said I can’t stop thinking about it. Trust me I know what she said might not sound like a big deal but she knows me and she knows I’m not trying to fake a personality I’m just very laid back. What she said really pissed me off and she isn’t the easiest to talk too for the possible comments that say “just talk to her and tell her how you feel about what she said”. I seriously hate that she said that. When someone treats me wrong I tend to tell myself that in my future I will have nothing to do with them and they won’t be able to come to me for anything. She does this a lot and I try to forget it every time it happens because she has done a lot for me and has some bipolar, but this here I just can’t forget or at least right now. idk what to do."
How do I forget a crush,"I grew up going to a v small catholic school w about 25 kids in each grade (nursery-8th). Since sixth grade, I kinda like this one kid and he kinda liked me but I was always quiet so nothing ever rlly happened. We went to the same high school and we both found a friend group and basically grew up, but when we had classes tg we would always sit and laugh and joke and j generally have a good time. Last year he would always snap me, dm me, try to start convos, uk. Then we talked a little over the summer but again, I’m pretty quiet, so not all the time. I always knew I liked him deep down but was always afraid to say it and I was pretty sure he liked me too, bc that’s what all my friends said. When this year started, we still talked for a little, but as the months went on, he found a new friend group full of toxic people and girls who are all over him. We barely talk anymore and even tho I sometimes see him trying to talk to me in the hallway, he’s just a completely different person-the attention has gotten to his head and he usually acts like a total asshole now. At the beginning of the year, I was considering telling him I liked him bc, hey we’re about to graduate after going to school tg since nursery so what do I have to lose? But now I wanna stop having feelings for him bc he’s just not the same. How do I forget someone I’ve been interested in for six years??"
Need some advice regarding my situation,"Since i was 4 years old i have been in this theater  group where my uncle is the founder. I joined because my mom wanted me to.
I enjoyed it for many years, mainly because i have friends there. 
For the last couple of years i have started to dislike it more and more, and realized that it isn't so nice after all.
The leaders there are very strict and if you can't do something right they call you an idiot.
I always feel very depressed there and always try to avoid going there. I've been thinking about quitting but it's really hard, and especially when it has been a part of my life for so long, and my mom still pressures me into going there, while my dad said i can quit if i want to. I'm also very bad at making choices and standing up to people. 
My close friend and cousin also goes there because he is my uncles son. I feel like if i leave he will be very depressed there.
Please if you have any advice i would be very thankful.
Sorry if my English is bad its my fourth language.."
My father compares me to my mother in arguments,"(sorry I'm on Mobile)
 for some info: My mom walked out when I was about 7 and my father raised me since.

me and him aren't that close anymore and we got into a argument earlier(about a half hour ago) since  he thought I told him to leave me alone for awhile since I was stressed and he started screaming at me while I just sat there.
he started screaming something along the lines of ""oh you're just like your mother, what are you going to do when you live with someone!"" While walking around in the other room.
I just yelled back to him "" dad I asked nicely and respectfully, neither of you ever have treated me with respect!"" And he stormed upstairs without saying anything.
(I kinda find this ironic since I'm 15F and he's acting like a teenager, my grandmother also thinks he acts like a teen)
He also said beforehand ""oh you would listen to (stepmoms name) !"" Of course I would she's respectful and treats me like a person with my own thoughts and ideas."
oh no i have a crush,"ok so i have a problem..

my friend asked me who i thought was the hottest at a guys lunch  table and i had said my now crush because he was the most attractive guy out of there table then i started having a crush on him big more of a not admitting to myself that i had a crush on him but then my friend had told my friend i called him hot and she asked what he thought of me he ( my friend’s words) got nervous and walked away. but he never talks to me and doesn’t do the light thing people do when they do like look at you for a second or try and talk to you...i feel like he got uncomfortable about what i had said. this is been on my mind all the time i have no idea what to do"
"Am I cheating? I don’t know really what I want but I need to talk to the girl and tell her, basically it’s all in here, I’m just really unsure of myself.","Am I a cheater? I don’t know how to explain to this girl that I still want to be with her.

So, I’m 15, I was talking to this girl, who I go to school with, same grade, We’re in highschool, we Aren’t dating, we’ve both made that clear but we still spend time together and kiss, but don’t hug or hold hands weirdly enough, I try but, she doesn’t seem to want really to show that kind of affection. But anyways she loves to go through my phone and today, she decided to go through my Snapchat, and found I was talking to some other girl who doesn’t go to our school, but is an old friend who I started to have interest in because we’re super alike, our birthdays are a week apart and we just have tons of fun talking, we both have interest in dating each other aswell. And she(the girl who goes to my school) went through my phone and saw it, she showed me, was visibly upset, and now won’t talk to me, I don’t know what to do because I like her, I care about her, but I need to get her to talk to me in order to tell her that we have different viewpoints on a relationship, I love being with who I’m with and hold hands and hug I like average couple stuff, but she doesn’t, she doesn’t like to hug and doesn’t really like to be seen with me much. I don’t even really know if I want to stay with her honestly but both of our friend groups are intertwined and, this will definitely just, create a ripple affect because I was scared to say what I wanted. I basically need advice on what to say to her, I’m lost right now. We aren’t dating, but is it still cheating? I’ve never cheated or been in a situation like this so I honestly don’t know what to do. Thanks in advance."
My best friend doesn't want me to have my crush,"I have developed a crush for a girl (she is in my class), we went to a couple of party's and also slept in the same bed once, we kinda made out but nothing more but we were really drunk. She also said that she liked me but I'm not Shure if she meant it in a loving way.

So anyways I'm trying to get her to be my girlfriend but one of my best mates, who is a good friend of her but nothing more always tries to stop anything happening between me and my crush.

What should I do, should I confess my feelings to her or should I just shove it down and not do anything?"
How can I cut a Toxic friend out from my life?,"Hello wonderful people of Reddit, I was initially unsure of where to post this so I hope it's alright here. I'm currently looking for advice after four years of dealing with a manipulative and possessive ""friend"". I'm really sorry that this post is quite long...

We are currently in our last year of school and I look forward to cutting him from my life after I leave. I know I can block him but I'm still worried that he could find ways to contact me, and I know if he does harass me then I can contact the police but I've never done so before and unsure how it would be handled? It makes me anxious not knowing what could happen. My plan was the month we leave to just block him and change my usernames on the accounts I use / open new ones so that he wouldn't  know it's me? I'm very unsure of how to handle this abe probably sound very silly but honestly I need some direction, I dont know who I could talk to who would take the situation seriously. 

I dont want to have any contact at all with this person as for the last four years he has literally been a plague in my life and has forced me away from my group of friends (one of which I am still very close with but Toxic Friend has threatened us both in the attempt to try and stop us from being close.) And has demanded my immediate attention every single day, even through preliminary exams and actual examinations. My main reason for not blocking him currently is that he will yell abuse at me throughout the day and between classes like he has down previously in the last years that I've tried to block him, and simply being his ""friend"" is the only way to stop him from doing this. 

I'm sorry for being such a bother but can anyone advise me on the best way to get him out of my life? Additionally is there any precautions I can take online to keep him away, and offline too? 

(In advance sorry if anything is spelled wrong / that's weird. Although I've been living in England for six years the English language itself isn't my first. Hopefully you can still read this, sorry!)"

Advice

I  became friends with someone about 6 months ago and I thought everything has been going fine. We have shared some really personal stuff. But for the past couple of weeks I’ve started to notice something. I’m the one that always swipes up first on snap if he posts about something that he’s hurt about and etc, but never swipes up if I posted something I was hurt about. If we are on break from school, we could go 3 weeks without texting each other. He’s also very popular and has very close friends (like they have been friends since 3rd grade and are bonded through Christ) and I’ve been thinking that he’s using me for emotional support because I don’t know of any other reason that he would want to be friends me (just for the record, I’m a really good person and all). What should I do? I hope it doesn’t seem like I’m crazy or anything lol. Another thing, I honestly don’t know if he even cares about me, but I feel like I care more about him. I don’t want to waste my time on someone that doesn’t care about me."
The guy I like,Hello reddit! So there is a guy I really like. We started texting over the last few days and he has even told me he feels the same. The only problem is he has a girlfriend and wants to stay with her. What do I do?
Should I make the first move on this guy I’m talking to?,"This guy and I have been talking for 3 months now and we both like each other, but I feel like I like him a bit more. I can tell that he gets kinda shy around me which is why I’m thinking about making the first move but I don’t know if I should. We are going to be hanging out soon so I could really use some advice. Thank you!"
These people keep fucking patting my head,So everyday people keep patting my head like I'm some cute little dog or pet.  You know how embarrassing that is for a guy?  People literally ask if they can pat my head or hug me.  In the middle of class.  Were like working on some project and it's like dead silent.  This girl across from me asks if she can touch me.  Like what?  The fucking teacher looked at me.  I'm not some artifact at a museum that you can touch.  Is there anyway I can make them stop?
I don’t know what to do after highschool not gonna lie kinda afraid,"I’m in 12th grade I graduate in about 4 months 
My grades aren’t that great c’s"
my friends all have a group chat without me,"Yesterday I found out that my whole friend group has a group chat w/o me on it, because one of my friends was like “ How do I respond do what so-and-so said on the group chat?” and because I didn’t get a text, I asked “What group chat?”. She responded by saying “Oh are you not on this?” I said no and it was an awkward silence. Today it came up again, where my friend was wondering where we all were during lunch so she facetimed that group but i’m not on it, so I was sitting with two of my friends watching them join the call while I couldn’t. When I asked again about which group it was, she showed it to me, and it’s everyone except me, which. confuses me because no one has ever had an issue with me or brought anything they don’t like about me up at all. I also doubt it was a situation where they just didn’t realize I wasn’t on it, because there are six of us and the group is called “the high fives” (haha get it because like a high five but also five people that act high all the time) so it’s very clear that they knew only five people were in the group. My friends don’t really talk about feelings or serious shit that often and we just kind of mess around, how do I bring it up and say that it really hurt me without seeming like I’m being sensitive or annoying, or that one friend who’s not on the chat because no one likes them. Please please please help me i don’t know what to do!!"
"Wanting to move out, can’t yet","I’ve wanted to move out for a while now but the straw that broke the camel’s back is that currently, my very conservative mother has realized that I(17M) like most teens I’m assuming, masturbate and watch porn, and has put parental controls and censorship on all my devices. It’s not the end of the world but it’s irritating. I’ve found ways around them but it’s tough having them constrict what I deem “appropriate”.  They also control my life in a bunch of other, smaller ways. I realize they are trying to keep me safe but it’s becoming too much when I want my own freedom

I’ve gained a bit of perspective of what it costs to live on your own. From what I understand, I would have to take 2 full time jobs which I would be willing to do in order to have my own freedom. But the problem is, I still have to finish my senior year of high school, which I can’t finish and have time for 2 full time jobs(I already have a part time job as well which I could make full time). Finishing high school would obviously open up more job opportunities but I hate having to wait for that. I would go straight into college after but my family wouldn’t be able to afford it, and I don’t want to have to pay off student loan debt for years after, so I’m trying to look into ways to fully pay off my tuition(thinking of saving for few years once I’m living on my own then going back to be a programmer) 
My parents tell me that as long that I live under their roof, I have to obey their rules. I want to move out to avoid that but I can’t. I’m turning 18 in 2 months and am gonna try to make some big steps to change this then but right now I don’t know if there is anything I can really do other then just finish school. I’m sure there will be plenty of things along the way that I haven’t accounted for in my planning or things that will happen that are out of my control, but I am doing my best to plan out my future, atleast financially. 
TL:DR 17yo teen wants to move out from restrictive parents, but wouldn’t be able to afford it having to finish high school. 
Any advice on what I could do?"
"My boyfriend bought me gifts for Christmas, I want to break up but I don’t want to waste his money.","I’ve been dating my boyfriend ever since Christmas Eve, we’ve argued a couple of times which were quite tiring. I always have to tell him how to treat me or how to make me feel valued and it’s so tiring. I don’t want to leave him broken but I don’t want to date someone who doesn’t know how to properly treat a girl. For Christmas, he bought me gifts and I don’t want to waste his money because it’ll make me feel bad that he bought it and I broke up with him. 


Another thing: 
I’m a guarded person, I love hard, and I’m upfront. But, I have trust issues and I can’t bring myself to be happy or carefree when I’m dating someone because I feel like I’ll get betrayed, cheated on, or worse. When he doesn’t respond to my texts, it hurts a lot and I want to make him feel the pain of how I feel. I always feel like he’s probably “talking to another girl” but I can’t trust myself and I feel trapped. 

What do I do in this situation? Should I break up with him?"
"I'm 13m she 13f I have feelings for her, if you came to say your too young please do not comment.",So there's this girl I like I'm 13 she's 13 and I've known her for two years were good friends but I have feeling for her and ever since I've got back home from a 3 month long wilderness therapy program I found out she's now doing edibles and wax but i still have feelings for her how would I initiate a first kiss because I was gonna ask her to a movie and at the right time just lean in but I need advice.

Why do I feel like this?,"(21F) Hello guys not sure if I’m posting this correctly but I am really struggling with my emotions at the moment. I find myself up and down these last couple of months. One minute I’m ok, the next minute the smallest thing can happen and I’m a wreck. I cry, shake, can’t eat, just want to lock myself in a room. I also feel like my partner is doing things to spite me to make me feel like shit, he knows I’m up and down I’ve spoke to him and asked him to bare with me whilst I try to deal with how up and down I am. He says he’ll support me but when it comes to it he screams at me calls me a brat, an idiot, a bitch and I honestly just feel like I’m on my own. Can someone give me recommendations to try to manage my emotions please? Thank you"
Being poor sucks,"Honestly I just came to vent.
Being poor is so embarrassing. Having no money for new shoes and school supplies.I'm a junior in high school and I've had the same shoes since freshmen year.I know I'm lucky to have a roof over my head, and food in my fridge, but I can't help feeling sad when I see holes in my shoes and pants I can't fit.And my anxiety convinces me that everyone laughing and talking about me.anyway it's almost Halloween so I have a reason to live(jk) comment(?) If you relate I just want to talk with somebody I can relate to:)"
"[Serious] Do I have to love my difficult, self-centered and narcissistic father?","Hey guys! Ever since I could remember my father and I have had a pretty strained relationship. Growing up my father had a very hard time expressing his emotions. For most of my childhood he was always at work and was always thinking about money. I vividly remember being really young, maybe six years old, and him showing me his bills and how much he had to pay. He would explain how much he is doing for me and that I should be thankful for his sacrifices. My whole childhood was spent discussing money, bills and my father's stress about making money and paying the bills. **I felt like his therapist instead of his daughter.** He only seemed to talk to me when he WANTED to rather than being there for me because he was my father. He never really took the time to get to know me, however, he didn't have any problems trying to exercise his control over me. He knew how to push my buttons with guilt, always trying to make me feel like his behavior was MY fault. He was very verbally abusive and didn't hesitate to curse or put me down. I spent a lot of my childhood trying to earn his love through awards, a nearly perfect GPA and a full four-year merit scholarship to college. Little did I know chasing after those things would never make him change. My dad is 62 years old now, and he still hasn't changed. Sure he doesn't yell as much anymore, but he's still the same guy. The only reason he's changed is for HIS own health because HE doesn't want to take in stress although he didn't mind making me and my mother stressed for the past 18 years. I'm at a stage in my life where I no longer felt empathy towards him. I don't know if I should love him. **How can I love my father if I don't like his personality? I really need help because these experiences still cut deep and hurt.** 

Just to sum up some of my traumatic experiences/memories associated with my father:

1. My dad talking non-stop about his stress and piling his emotional pain onto me . His favorite sentence is ""I'm sick"" (even though he isn't sick) and ""My head hurts"". He doesn't know how to have a conversation that doesn't involve HIM. It is always about him, his life and his problems. 
2. He only talked about money and bills. He always painted money in a negative light, and constantly reminded me of how sad and stressed he was about paying our bills. As a result, he made me feel like a burden on him. 
3. He likes drinking and socializing more than being a father. The only time I've seen my father really happy is when he drinking or with friends. He may stress about money but does not hesitate to buy a big bottle of alcohol for him and his friends. He drinks almost every night and self medicates his pain with alcohol. 
4. He use to be aggressive when I was a child. He would swerve the car if he got mad and his yell was very very very loud. He would basically scream in our faces and threaten to hit us if we challenged him or his authority. 
5. I saw him treat my mother like shit. He never once respected my mother or the work that she does to provide for me and my family. I watched him yell at her and curse at her. The first traumatic memory I have had of my father is him yelling and screaming and cursing at my mother to the point she left our apartment and ran out the door. I was five.

Should I wear coloured contacts to school? How would people react? How would you react? Is it considered a part of makeup?,"Recently I have bought some coloured contacts because I don’t like the brown colour of my eyes. I am also joining a new school however, I do know some of the people that already go there. What happens if they think I’m weird? Should I just not bother?"
I don’t feel the same way back and idk how to deal with it,one of my guy friends has recently confessed to me and i genuinely do not know what to do. he’s been very open about it and i appreciate it but at the same time i feel kinda weirded out? i’m not sure how to describe it but i know it’s different. we had a thirty minute talk a couple of days ago and i told him i can’t feel the same way back but he didn’t really listen to that but rather went on how much he liked me and what he liked about me. i consider him a best friend and he likes me and i don’t know what to do because i don’t want to straight out ignore him but i don’t want to continuously hang out with him before because i feel like that would give him the wrong idea.
Help! My parents are always on my crazy little brother’s side,"Here is a little background: I am 14 and have straight a’s. I have a little brother who is only 5 and has temper problems. He gets mad on the slightest things I do. For example, today, I was eating my breakfast and my little brother was watching a video on a laptop. He then said “Wow this is my favorite episode” in Armenian. I looked over to see a glimpse of what his favorite episode was and then he started screaming and closed the laptop really hard. He quickly ran to my mom who saw everything and started telling her about how I peered at his laptop. My dad quickly came and picked him up and said “WHY DO YOU ALWAYS MAKE YOUR BROTHER CRY?!” My baby brother was still yelling and crying in frustration and my mom was also very disappointed at me and said to my dad to take me to my Granparents house. I started telling them that I did not do anything bad and that my brother was screaming for no reason. They did not listen to me and my dad said “ok, if you are going to be like this for the whole summer, we will take you to summer school!” And then I said “if you do that, I will fail every class.” Then he got mad and I went to my bedroom in frustration. See, this happens every day and I am done with it. Please give me advice on how to solve this problem and why my parents are always on my brothers side."
My friend wants to do a school shooting and is obssessed with the columbine killers.,"Hello , for personal reasons i won't say his name . Here is the thing. I've met this guy for a bit more than a year now , and we grew really close , close as best friends. He learned that i was interested in crimes ( as i love to LEARN about the mental state and all since i wish to be a psycological student ) and he told me that he wished to do a school shooting. He already planned it when he was still in high school , he is now 21 ( i am soon to be 18 ) and not long ago he told me : give me less than a year and i will do it ( the shooting ) . He recently got some real guns .. I al afraid and don't know what to do. But more over , he was in love with me. But obssesively in love with me , scarily in love with me . I then tried to avoid him as i am no longer single . I never gave him mixed signals or anything. And lately he ""lost"" all his memories and doesn't remember me. I haven't seen him since , but as we have common friends i still hear about him , and he still wants to do a school shooting. I really don't know what to do , as i really care for him and still think of him as a great friend , but i am quite stressed out and lost.. Please help me ( ps: i live in france )
UPDATE: I finally gathered the courage to talk about to a school staff. They called a security agent ( who is also a police officer) and they're going to take care of it and keep me updated about it. I soon have to meet this agent to see what she can do , and if she thinks i need protection or something. Thank you guys for  all the usefull advices . I'll keep you updated.

Update:
It's been almost a year now, and here's what happened.
I went to the police station and pleaded against him. he was arrested for over a week and his name is in the police's files as potential terrorist . 
I've talked to him once after that but stopped as it made my ""trauma"" worst.

All I know is that now he hates me , but still talks about me a. lot to an old friend of mine ( both of them meet at a club and talk about me) or at least that's what the old friend told me.
I've seen him around town , and he sent me death glares, but I guess it is expected.
I don't know where he is mentally but , I know he saw/ still see (?) a psychiatrist, which can only be good , right ?

anyways , even after all this time I still think about it and it makes me feel bad . Thank you for your support, It means a lot ."
I don't seem to have the ability to have a flowing conversation with people.,"I hate that I'm doing this. Going on an ""advice for teens"" thing REALLY is not my style, but fuck it.

I can't seem to be able to walk up to a person, acquaintance or stranger, and talk for a good amount of time without them looking very uncomfortable or awkward. They eventually find an excuse to leave. I'm sure that more practice with this will help me, but does anyone have any sort of advice for me? Well, not just me, I'm sure there are plenty of others who could use some help too. I mean, hey, this is a sub for teenagers. "
I am a..,"First generation citizen, child of Mexican immigrants, college bound senior in high school that has been accepted to her dream college (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) that has no idea how to pay for the amount of money that financial aid will not cover. Loans are not an option, at least not 11,000 in loans. 
I was just wondering if there was anybody out there that could point me in the right direction, or anybody that could let me know of any scholarships that I could apply for because I would really like to change the direction my family's children have gone in.
This may or may not be in the right category but I'm new to reddit. 
Any help though?
It'd be much appreciated.
Even any helpful tips are welcome!
Thank you!"
I'm sick of this culture,"I just can't stand it anymore. All the partys I go to play shit music, even though I'm not shunned for what I like, I am still frowned upon when I mention it. For example, I love old video games and nintendo. Everyone in my school always talks about the new games that are coming out and when I mention A game such as sonic generations, they all just laugh and say things like ""why don't you go suck sonics dick?0"" I usually reply with another insult and we get into a friendly insult fight. I also don't listen to mainstream music, Infact the only ""real"" band I listen to is the beatles. Most of the time I listen to video game music. Which again I am frowned upon for. I am not really one to get depressed but whenever I think about this I start to get abit sad. Anyone else feel this way? Also, any advice on how to deal with this decaying culture?"
Can't figure this girl out,"This feels weird to ask the internet for help, so bare with me here. Im a Junior in Highschool with one week till the school year is over. Over the past two months I've been partying, and hooking up with this other Junior. Just recently we started texting each other. I'm beginning to like her a lot more, and am definitely stumped on whether or not she even likes me back. I've been lightly flirtatious since I don't want to completely blow this up if in fact she doesn't like me. 

I have asked her to go out and grab something to eat with me, but since she has been studying to take her SAT today, she denied my offer but replied with ""I would definitely want to go however..."" It's also hard to ask her to do other activities since we have finals this coming week. 

We both don't struggle to force conversations when we texts, it happens fluidly. However we both take a while to reply. Most likely because I am a slow replier. It is clear that she likes talking to me, but it's hard to tell if she would want anything more. So what do you guys think? Does she like me, or not?

Living A Life Of Abundance Laws of Confidence When Approaching Women.,https://youtu.be/tVGiZXD2xvM
A suicidal friend,"So my parents jambe been friends with two collègues forever and they have a daughter. This daughter is the same age as me but she redoubled twice, which made at one point be in my brother’s class. 
I’ve always been friendly with her and I knew she was a bit of a social outcast but I didn’t think it was that bad. I haven’t spoken to her for over a year and she called me the other day to see if we could see each other. I felt alarmed and made time for it but then she cancelled so we called instead and I found out she was miserable and it was pretty apparent she was having suicidal thoughts. I tried to reassure her and listened to her problems. Then I checked in on her everyday and she always answered really sadly. Today she suddenly asked to meet up again and I told her I didn’t have time today but I could tomorrow and she said “okay...”. Then I asked what’s wrong and she said “I dunno things are getting so difficult I can barely stand on my two feet anymore”. Should I alert her parents???? The other day she fell asleep and didn t answer one of my messages and I just assumed she’d gone to bed but the next morning she said “don’t worry I’m still alive”. Apparently her mom had thought she’d killed herself.
Anyways, what do you think I should do? For reference we’re 18."
I like this girl but I am a very socially awkward.,"As the title suggests, I like this girl(we were in primary school together but then we separated due to different schools) and I recently messaged her to see if we could meet up and I didn’t really go as planned.

I messaged her to see if she could meet up with me and we could reconnect. She said she would but then 1 week before we were going to she didn’t really want to anymore. I have a big crush on her but I don’t know if she has the same feelings for me or if she is actually seeing someone else.

Also I’m a very socially awkward person(especially around people I have feelings for) so I don’t know what to do at all.

Please could I have some advice on how to go about this as I use to really think it would work out together but now I’m not to sure."
Mom Won't Let Me Get TikTok.,"Okay so I know this is dumb, but I really want the TikTok app. I \[13F\] am home-schooled and NOT allowed to use any type of social media. All of my friends have it, and I feel that it can be a good way to get to know other peoples interests, and it just looks fun. Is there any way I could discretely have it? I don't think I can get it on my phone, because my mom enabled a thing so she can see all of my activity. She gets kinda creepy with this stuff. I don't even want to post slutty/annoying stuff on TikTok. I just want to do wholesome shit and have fun. I just think she is being weird about it. She doesn't even let me scroll through Youtube half of the time, so I don't think I can convince her. If anyone can think of a discrete way to have a TikTok account, that would be nice."
High school drama,"Ok so this is gonna be some high school drama bullshit so if you don’t like that just keep going but I would appreciate some help. 

My best friend got in his first serious relationship and I do not like the girl. She has talked lots of crap about me in the past and told everyone that she would take my best friend away from me. Even with that I tried to be nice.... she denied me every single time. Later I decided to have a Christmas party and since she hadn’t been talking to me I didn’t invite her, I even asked my best fiend if that’s okay and he said it’s fine. She got pissed and decided to throw a party the same day. I apologized many times and I decided to cancel my party for her. I was close to a lot of her friends but I never told them how I felt because I didn’t want to ruin their friendship. Later we all found out that she has been talking crap about all of us and she ditched her other friends so they are kinda on my side. We recently we went on a trip for school and we decided not to talk to there group because she gets very jealous when girls talk to my best friend and we didn’t want to deal with the shit talking. They blamed us and started telling people that we were talking shit about them. 

My best friend doesn’t know any of this is happening. I want to tell him but I believe he will just think I’m making shit up because I don’t like her. 

Any advice to stop this ? 

Thank you"

"I have super religious parents, help?","My parents are extremely religious and as I am ftm trans and bisexual, they disapprove and are actively angry at me the majority of the time. I’m 15 and I just came out to them and they refuse to acknowledge it or refer to me as my preferred name/pronouns, though the but of information I’ve gotten from my mom was one time when she said “it’s not how we raised you” before my dad cut her off. This leads me to believe it’s because of their toxic Christianity. They have always mocked me and we constantly get into huge arguments over me being agnostic. I don’t know how to get them to listen to my side with out yelling at me and they refuse to let me start testosterone or even get a binder. They think if they ignore it that it’ll just fix itself and I won’t be trans anymore. I don’t know what to do, does anyone have a similar experience that they’ve gotten through and have advice?"

I have depression. Help,"If anyone is willing to read this and give me advice I’d love it. But I wouldn’t be surprised if no one can help me :( or if no one is willing to read. 

I’m new to reddit. I want to ask for some advice. I’m struggling with depression, but I live in a household where depression doesn’t exist and that if you’re sad you turn to God. 

I can’t go and seek professional help without my parents knowing. My depression is getting very bad. I have lost motivation to take care of myself. I don’t shower, I barely brush my hair and I stink and you can just tell by looking at me that I don’t take care of myself. I’m Muslim so I mask my hair with a hijab so you can’t tell that I don’t take care of it. And I smell like shit because taking a shower feels like work. Everything feels like a task, like a million pound bolder is on me. 

I don’t help out with chores and I’m basically deemed useless and get yelled at all the time. I’m called a disgrace and a disappointment for how I treat myself and how I act. But I can’t help it :(. I don’t have the decency to help myself how can I help anyone else? The only thing I had motivation for was school because I still cared for having a bright future somehow. 

One thing that makes me more depressed is my strict parents. I’m 18, a whole adult and my parents don’t allow me to hang out with my friends or really even do anything for myself. I’d have to beg to hang out with them, as if hanging out with my friends is a holiday thing. I can’t leave the house and do things for myself. Because they have a sexist view of what women can do. I feel like I can’t do anything I want anyways so what’s the point of even trying on myself ? I’m destined to be locked in this house. I don’t even ask to stay out late. I don’t drink, smoke, etc. But I can’t even walk out the house and go to the park by myself :( 

But now, my depression has gotten so bad that I’m starting to get lazy doing my school work, the only thing I had motivation to do. I’ve gained so much weight, I’m irritated over everything, I sleep all the time, new health issues present themselves to me. And I’m scared :( 

If anyone is willing to read this, I’d love your advice. Because my future looks rough if it continues like this."
"I've just moved to America, I want to move back","I'm 17 and just moved to California a little over a year ago with my family against my will. I'm originally from Australia and I absolutely loved my life there. I'm 18 in a few months but definitely not able to completely financially support myself, if I make the move back home my parents will cut me out of their lives. Everytime I try and explain how I'm feeling the only answer I get is ""you're just not trying hard enough."" Maybe they're right but I don't want to start a life here. It's been difficult making connections as I am not in school, instead moved straight on to my BA so it makes it difficult to meet people my own age. I'm just not sure what to try anymore"

"should I believe my gut, or am I over worrying","My partner and I have been together for almost a year and due to unfortunate personal events have temporarily lived with eachother previously, however has recently moved to a small country town not far from me. I have always been told to trust my instinct and currently it is telling me that she is seeing her ex behind my back. I also have a few reasons to believe this such as her hiding messages from me, refusing to let me see her phone and most of all, messages to eachother talking about hanging out. I have felt this way before but always wrote it off as paranoia and overthinking, however this seems too suspicious. please help, I dont know what to do."
Why do I (F16) find it difficult to be happy?,"I’ve been struggling with this problem for a while now. A while in being about 6 years (so from the age of 10).

I’ve been in two online relationships that have both failed and can’t seem to get over either boy 100% and wish they could both still be in my life. The thought of not having my most recent ex (M18) seems to bother me so much more than it did when I broke up with the first boy, and I don’t understand why? Was that actually love? Was I just attached? Is love just an attachment and have I ever felt real love? 

I feel asthough Im an idiot for caring about these two boys that I met through a game so much, like I care about them more than I care about myself even now that neither are in my life. Todays the first time since the begining of the year that I’ve really felt alone and I think its because valentines day just passed but even then, I shouldn’t feel so unhappy in my own company on a normal Saturday. 

My life consists of: 
- being alone in my room
- listening to music 
- smoking weed 
- writing stupid stories on my computer
None of these things have particularly helped with my mood swings, how uphappy i am or my social anxiety and probably never will. But it stops me from thinking sometimes which is nice. I stop thinking about my exes. I stop thinking of how much of a disappointment I am (for example today I over slept and missed my job interview). I stop thinking about wanting to be dead so Im not in anyones shot at happiness. And thats how I’ve always been. 

I saw CAMHs the other week which didn’t help at all (I went about 3 years ago after attempting suicide but that time was much worse, I couldnt get a word in). Since then I haven’t gone to college because honestly I dont know. 
I feel asthough my friends are disappointed in me for not coming in and asking to link. I feel asthough my family’s disappointed in me because I cant get to college, because I over sleep, because I cant sleep at night. 

All I want to do is be happy and the only time Im happy is when Im with someone. I rely on someone to make me happy and I dont know how to get out of that. Before its too late and I’m completely lost and gone."
My best friend made new friends and now ignores me,"She and I have been very close best friends for over five years now, and she helped me through a lot of tough stuff at home. However, since joining Sixth Form she’s been hanging out more with some new friends and I feel like she only hangs out with me when she has to. I know this sounds like I’m really clingy but I’m not, I want her to have loads of friends and be happy. But there’s been multiple occasions where she’s agreed to meet me but gone off with those guys and left me waiting, and she never messages me anymore and rarely replies when I message her despite being on her phone all the time. She always tells them her plans and leaves me in the dark, for example she didn’t come in the other day because she was sick but didn’t tell me so left me waiting for her again but told all her new friends. Even today, we both only had one lesson so have been doing independent work in the common room, and she’s barely said two words to me despite being sat right next to her but has been talking non stop to her friend sat on her other side. I left to go have some time with my thoughts and when I came back she hadn’t even noticed I’d gone. I know some of you would say just drop her, but I’ve never been as close to someone as I was with her and honestly I don’t have any other friends to turn to. I want to still be her friend. Any advice?"
What's on your mind?,"What's on my mind?
What isn't? 
If you can answer a question with another question who's to say that's not an answer? 
Who's to say the problem isn't that we can't find an answer, it's that there is never just one, but many? 
If you want to find your own path you've got to pave it yourself. 
We're so quick to get discouraged when we realize the knowledge everyone else seems to have mirrors our own, but how could you possibly expect to learn something truly new if the only knowledge you seek is what's already been found?
You want to be different, you have to BE different. 
You want to be different, right?
You want to make a difference right? 
In some way, shape, or form.. 
And if you don't, you must want peace right? 
If the knowledge we have, mirrors the knowledge of millions, wouldn't you think that contradicts the desire to be different? 
To be seen, heard, felt. 
It's not to be different that you're searching for, you feel the way you do when you do because you are different, even if you don't see it. 
Somewhere in you there's always going to be something you want, there will always be a million reasons to let it go, but I'm sure if you think deep enough there's another million reasons to reach for it. 
There will always be an equal argument to everything you believe in. 
You are meant to stand for what you believe in, but somewhere in that context they forgot to remind us that not everyone's beliefs mirror ours.. mind you I said beliefs not knowledge.
The problem never truly lies within the problem, it lies within your response to it. 
Whether it be race, sex, religion, sexual preferences (or none at all), any and every ""problem"" you may find you face 
We weren't taught problem solving because everything in life was easy, but exactly the opposite. 
I find that many of the things I preach are advice I either once couldn't, or can't take now. 
Today I found, who am I to say any of you are wrong? 
Well, who are you to say I am? Any of you.
We we're always told to ask questions, so we did exactly the opposite, because we're always told the answer lies within, it may, but who's to say your answer is the only one?
Everyone is still trying to find out who they are, if you're still trying, you'll die trying. 
Why? Because what you once knew may be looked at in a different light tomorrow? 
If knowledge is power then we all have power, we're all just trying to figure out how to use it.
I'm not here to change your mind, I challenge you to change mine.
There's enough negativity to go around, if you want to be different, create something different."

I am very scared of fighting.,"I am 16 y old male with a kinda scared personality. I am the ""capibara"" type of person. So I made a bad joke (on WhatsApp) to some gypsy and he got really angry. He threat me to come to my highschool and beat the crap out of me. I know it sounds ridiculous, but this guy has like 4 convictions and does drugs. 

When I received the threat I had a panick attack and my temperature rose a lot. It never actually happened, but I am afraid one of my old friends from my ex-highschool  will accidentally remind him of me.

Many people said he can't fight and I am an absolute unit of a boy 1.84 m and 94kg. But I am still a little scared. 

I always backed down when it came to fighting, even in competitions (sth like karate). I understand that in the worst case scenario I just get beaten up, but I can't shake this anxiety feeling. I sometimes wish someone to just come and force me to fight them so I can stop being scared of it.

I train to gain muscles and I slowly build up courage, but I am still scared."
How do I start a conversation,"I just wanna talk but idk how to start a conversation sometimes. Smalltalk works but not all the time. I'm partially asking for talking to friends, partially for people I don't know. Most of my friends I don't have much struggle with but some I do."
is it weird if you feel like you don’t like anybody but still try to please them?,"i’m really confuse right now. i could hate someone so much that i wished they’d disappear, but 10 seconds later, i found myself tried my best to make them happy.

 i don’t get along with my ‘best friend’ as much as i used to do and it’s seem like i am the only one who feel this way. i am an asshole. i’ve talked behind her back with probably everybody in our group of friend and most of them agree with me. tbh she is very mean and every time we told her that, she just laughed then brushed it off. but i don’t know if she knows that we talk shit about her and sometimes i feel kinda guilty. and i don’t know why but i have a feeling that i am afraid of her. our relationship is not equal (is that how you describe it??). i have always have an advantage but i am the one who feel 
insecure, like why?

for some reasons i cannot give up my friendship with her (we have know each others for 5 years). no matter how much i hate her, i still find myself try to please her. wtf is wrong with me??

How to stop picking my nails/the skin around them,"I've had a bad habit for a few years of picking my cuticles. I usually do it subconsciously when I'm nervous, anxious, or even just bored.

I am a high schooler and I need support and advice,"(I am not used to Reddit and it's etiquette so forgive me for my mistakes.)

Hi, I am a male high schooler going through a rough time, and I would like. At school, I used to be much more extroverted but because of this classmate, let's just call him ""E,"" I have become much more introverted. E kinda pushed me away from my friends because he insulted me for being myself and has called me hurtful names in the past (I understand that other people have been through much worse, but I would appreciate it if you would just give advice instead of a comparison). I asked E to stop it because it hurt my feelings and he has stopped, but he did it so much that I adapted to not do things that I feel like I need to watch everything I do so he wouldn't insult me again (he called me ""retard"" once for being clumsy) when I am at school and now I feel the need to do it when I am at home even though he is not here.

How do I move on and stop obsessing over what E thinks of me and forget that he was mean to me?

I feel like I’m not good enough,"I work out, I try to be nice, funny and charismatic with people but I feel weak and I feel like a pushover. I have a girlfriend but sometimes I get the feeling I’m not good enough, and I feel that if her and I break up it’s going to be hard to find another girl because I feel like every girl I talk to views me as a creep even though I’m never saying or doing anything inappropriate. If anything I try REALLY hard NOT to come off that way, to the point where I don’t even try. Sometimes I even feel like I don’t look good enough and I feel like I have to look a certain way just for people to like me. Whenever I ask someone for advice they tell me to be myself but I have no idea what that means because I’m already being myself. I have anxiety and I tend to overthink certain things. I feel like I have confidence issues because I find myself hating others who actually have confidence. I actually try to have confidence.

(M14) I think I might be transgender.,"(This is copied from my other posts about this since I don't know a better way to phrase it.)

I am a 14 year old boy. I feel like I could *possibly* be transgender, and have some questions. 

1: is it normal for teenagers to feel like they might identify as the other gender?

A few years ago, a friend was using the opposite pronouns and using a name of the opposite gender (not telling too much so people I know don't realize it's me) .  (also, people were being assholes to people who didn't use the pronouns/name they wanted, and I kept forgetting, so I almost lost a friend because of people being assholes, but back to the main point. Sorry I'm not staying focused) they eventually stopped and said they *thought* they were transgender but aren't. Could that be the same for me?

2. How do I know if I'm transgender?

3. If anyone reading this is transgender, how did you realize that you were?

Hopefully this post makes sense"
Should I quit a club I’ve done for so long? It feels like betrayal.,"Hi. Basically I’m the type of person who likes doing sports. I do martial arts, netball, basketball and want to start dance (modern). However, the time this dance is on clashes with martial arts (tkd specifically).

The thing is... I’m not sure if I want to do tkd anymore. I used to love it and have a passion for it but now I dread Tuesdays and fridays (when I have it). One of my instructors works at a gym as a personal trainer, so we spend majority of the session doing really hard and tiring exercises, bare in mind that I’m 14, and one of the older ones. But I’ve been doing tkd for years, my sister does it and I’ve competed and won stuff. I feel like it’s a big part of my identity and what makes me me. I just don’t enjoy it anymore. My black belt grading is soon, (2 months) so I can’t miss any sessions.

Also I now don’t like competitions. Back in February 2019 I broke both bones in my wrist fighting someone at training. Since then, I’ve kind of been scared that I’m gonna get injured and I’ve moved up a category too (lightweight to middleweight). The girls in this category are a lot bigger than me so this makes me even more scared.

So all of this in account, idk if I wanna do it anymore. If I stopped I would feel like I’m betraying my instructor and all my friends there (basically family). But I really want to start dance. My friend would join it too because she is free but I am obviously not. Also, I’ve never really done dance before (unless u count baby ballet) and if I joined a different club all by myself I’d be really behind and lonely. I JUST DON’T KNOW! 

I guess I could quit tkd after I make black belt, but that would feel wrong as it would look like I’m only in it to get a black belt. 
Please help! I need advice! I’m aware that this is a lot to read and probably doesn’t make sense but I will take any advice I can get.
Thanks x"

The result will pretty much determine the college I will go to. I want to aim very high - like I would even enter with tax - high. Many say I am a smart student. The problem is that I don't trust myself that much. At the semester's exam I was lower than some people, and lower than I expected (my grade was 7 from 10), even though the general grade was very high.

I am feeling down when it comes to school. I am usually tired and uninterested at some lessons. When I need to do homework I can't write 15 minutes without checking my phone or PC. It is not like I don't find meaning in what I do, in fact I do. The problem is I am too tired to try. I had this feeling for like 2 years. I know I can do things, but I do them slower paced compared to others.

When I look at the future I am a little afraid that I see what hard path lies in front of me. Maybe it is just the age or a simple self-induced feeling. I have friends, but I have some problems in my family.

Edit: I don't think it is relevant, but I found out, after some medical analysis that I have a very slow metabolism, very close to the inferior normal limit. I always blamed that for my lack of energy."
Relationship with big age gaps.,"Hey, It's the first time I post and it's because I want to know how bad can a relationship with a big age gap can affect and turn into abuse trauma.
The thing is that when I was 15 years old (I'm 17 at the time) I met this guy who was 9 years older than me and we started a relationship, I didn't knew it was that bad, he made me think it was normal and that ""age is just a number"", I turned him into a father figure, we broke up and I started a relationship with another guy, one my age and I noticed how different things were, like, I didn't pictured him as a father but just as my couple, like normal relationships are.
Months after I got back with my ex (this guy my age broke up w/me because he didn't felt good enough) and lost my virginity to him, he was nicer than back then when I met him, but he reminded me so much of my mom's ex-boyfriend, who molested me in a sexual way when I was younger, so he often brought memories and traumas back and when I finally decided to leave him forever (i left in november of the past year) noticed how much he triggered me and that our relationship wasn't even normal in the first place, now even a slight mention of him makes me feel very anxious at the point I cry remembering when he was mean to me.
I want to know if this kind of reaction is normal or is just that I had a different experience and relationships with age difference are normal.
P.D: Sorry if my writing doesn't make sense or is unnecessarily long, English is not my mother language but this is the only place I know I could have an advice."
Feeling excluded from a group. Can’t take it anymore,"Hi ! So um something really really bothered me a few days ago and i didn’t know what to do so here i’am.. 
So let me start of the beginning, i’m a junior in high school and well my main classes are with people that i’m not really friends with. but with time i met 3 girls in my class and became friends  , ( let’s say Candice , Clara and Jane )the 3 aren’t friends.. , anyways. with time we really started  having fun together in every single class even outside of school / we go out and do projects together and even created a groupchat for the 4 of us.. and we got pretty close that  we literally tell each other our secrets ( you know the type of stuff you tell someone when you’re pretty confortable & close with them). Anyways , something happened a few days ago that made me confused? upset? idk honestly.. something really serious happened to Jane and her ex crush, and she told us the evening that something happened, and when we were waiting for her to tell us she literally turned to me and said : ‘Sorry but i’m not telling you’ , I was like ‘What why’ but she said that she’s kidding, i brushed it off anyways. That night in the group chat jane said : come on candice i’m gonna tell’you what happened cuz you need to know but candice said that she’s not home so she can’t really talk , then she asked clara if she’s available to talk, clara was outside too, I was LITERALLY waiting for her to tell me but she didn’t even mention my name. so i texted the group ‘hey what abt me? am I inexistant or what?’ so she said : ‘lol just kidding’ and the convo stopped  there. 
The next day, Jane didn’t come to school, and i literally heard the other two : candice and clara talking about that ‘secret’ and she was like ‘what do you think?’ when i heard that i immediately knew that jane told them and not me, i didn’t even bother to ask them. So i went to jane’s best friend (whom i’m friends with too) and i asked her if she told you about the matter , her best friend said yes she told me and i was like wow she didn’t even tell me and told candice and clara, why do you think she didn’t tell me? so her best friend literally said : its something really personal , candice and clara are really close so ofc she told them but you and her are just simple friends so ofc she won’t tell you . Those words shocked the F outta me . How the hell are we ´simple’ friends ??? was she considering me a ‘simple’ friend after all? why does she consider the other 2 closer than me since we literally became friends at the same time. like we didn’t know each other before junior year. I felt disappointment and a little bit of sadness.. That night she (jane) texted the groupchat :’how did you react when you saw him guys’ and she was literally talking to the other 2 girls.  Anyways after that , i found out about something else : that the other one (candice) told something to the other 2 and not me. 
I felt that i was hella excluded from the circle and i shed some tears that night
i had so many questions like : Why are they hiding stuff from me , why aren’t they treating me like they’re treating each other. We literally became ( the 4 of us ) friends at the same period of time so why is it so unfair. 
So please help me , what should i do guys? i’m literally lost ."
I’m confused about my sexuality. Help?,"I’m 16F and I’m having thoughts. Not suicidal ones... but sexual ones. But they aren’t just boy x me, sometimes it’s me and some girls I know. For my whole life I’ve been straight but as of late, I’ve been thinking about kissing this girl in my weightlifting class. She’s really beautiful too. But she’s a bit out of my league. Enough about this.
Now to the point. I don’t know if I’m just curious or I’m actually lesbian or bi. Advice??

Edit: I texted her and got rejected. I’m okay and I’m gonna come out to my family"
Need some girl advice here,"I’m 16M and am straight. I’ll try to put in as much detail as possible. 

So I have a crush on this girl (also 16) who goes to my school. We share an art class. We are sorta friends who can sorta talk. It’s usually just “Hey how u doin” sort of conversations. I have her number. I know some of her interests like guitar and soccer. 

Ok. So I approached her this Wednesday’s and we had a conversation and then I said “hey maybe we should hang sometime.” To which She responded “yeah, definitely”. We continue to be on friendly terms, BUT she hasn’t answered any of my texts for the last 4ish days. 

Also there’s a dance coming up in a month. 

I just want your take on the situation. Please help. I’m kind of confused.

Feel free to DM/PM me if you feel it would be easier to give advice that way, or if you want more clarity."
what is the best way to get into an apprenticeship post-16?,"hi all!

pretty much what the title of the post says. I’m looking to go into an apprenticeship (preferably in the nhs) after my gcse’s but I’m not sure where to start. The nearby college offers them but they didn’t have any for medicine/nursing. From what I understand, you can apply directly with the nhs but I can’t find any information as to how.

if anyone could give me any advice/tips/people to contact etc., I’d really appreciate it!

thank you :)"
i cant do this anymore,"
i got a crush on a girl from my class. Yeah we are friends but i can get better at talking more

anyways.. i am thinking of telling her that i love her. (we have been in the same class since August and i have loved her since the first look at her)

But im so afraid of losing her. What is she talks less to me after that? That question actually keeps me up every night so i lose sleep.

if i tell her, i would say it around 30th of January or early February. i dont wanna do it the day before winter break cause i cant deal with all the thoughts while being home.

SO LISTEN FROM HERE PLEASE: (important)

i might be leaving the school in June if i choose to be a hairdresser/barber.

i CAN stay if i choose interior designer.

That job choice will be taken March 1st. and thats when we have winter break. So im really confused what to do.

Thats also the reason i wanna confess before the winter break so if it goes bad i can just choose to leave...

But i wanna become her close friend, what if she gets a boyfriend?

	⁃	if she actually says YES, im still not allowed by my parents to go outside after school or come home late... is that ok? But she most likely will say no.
Okay we can stay as friends but she might talk less to me.

When i think about it.. relationships are stress anyways.. i have given her HINTS like giving her christmas gift and stuff

BUT I GOTTA talk more i guess, the question still comes back though, do i ever confess?

She is single... its 1 am i hope you can help"
My best friend has a crush on me.,"Hi so I was wondering if anyone would help with my situation I’m honestly confused and lost on what to do. And my one fren day outside group doesn’t know how to help. 

Okay so, there’s about 7 people in our friend group. 6 girls and 1 boy. Though he doesn’t sit with us at lunch. Now I’m dating one of the girls in our group. I am also a female. Let’s name her Sarah. Me and Sarah have been dating since Saturday. I don’t really know if I like her or not I’m still figuring that out. Our relationship was a heat of the moment thing. I thought I did but I don’t know. I’m terrible I know. 

Anyways, I told the group about this on Monday. Sarah wasn’t at school. Now I had just figured out that me friend was pan (I’m bi btw..). This was a surprise for me. My impression on the group was privileged, white, straight, Christian girls. I was shocked. 

So, I started to ask her who she liked. She wouldn’t tell me at first and had me ask questions and stuff. So I did. And all of them lead to it being me. So I asked her. On paper. And turns out she does. 

Now I don’t really know what to do. I feel like it’s gonna be awkward. And I kinda like her which I told her so I feel like it’s gonna be weird. Plus me her and Sarah were planning to go to a play and the mall together on Saturday. Help.

Update: I broke up with Sarah but I still don’t know what to do about my friend."
Complicated scary af situation,"Im 14, male. So I've been friends with this guy since grade 5 and yeah i sleep over at his house every now and then but the problem is cringey but im not sure if its ok... my heart says yes but my mind says fuck it. Ive been through one or two relationships and I've learnt enough to know that im not very outgoing. But I've kinda fallen for his sister. But she's 16 and i live around 40 km away (over a mountain) and i dont know what do do. And my friend is going to boarding school for highschool from this year on so i don't know when i could see her (if it even happens) and im like family to their family and i dont even think that her dad approves of dating, much less of dating a child younger than her. But she gave me hugs and stuff when i help her out when im at my friends house
In my eyes she's almost perfect. 
She watches GoT, and TWD.
She's beautiful.
Sweet.
Kind. 
Loves videogames.
Has my sense of humor.
She isnt shallow or rude. 
And she stays up till 3 am with me playing games and watching movies when my friend goes to bed.
What do i do. Ive never really been scared in a relationship (or just a crush) but damn. Im scared. I don't want to ruin things between my friend or his sister. my friend leaves for school this sunday. Please help me :(

Edit: i didnt even use my throwaway :/"
My family wants me to be a doctor and I'm not sure about it,"    Before all else, a mandatory ""english is not my first language"", sorry if I make mistakes.
    So, I am in my junior year of high school, and my future always was a topic at family dinners and such, and my parents want to see me in the S.T.E.M. field, preferably something regarding medicine. And for the most part I actually agree with them, since I study a lot of these subjects right now and there a lot of jobs that provide you with financial stability in that field. In my country, when you get into highschool you have to choose a profile, I am in a natural sciences class. ((Basically a lot of chemistry, biology and physics))
     On the other hand, I have a passion for drawing. I had my big Moana moment one day, while I was studying biology I started drawing and I got really freaked out, cuz that felt like seeing my future ahead of me, always having to do something I don't enjoy as much as drawing, and that becoming a secondary thing in my life. 
      I want to know if I could be an animator, or something related to it, like idk, characterdesign. But in my country there is no animation major at any university and I don't want to rely on my parents for years to pay for my studies abroad only to study something they don't agree with. They already pay for my extracullicular biology classes, so telling them that I want to do something different would result in a huge fight.
     I just want you guys to...reassure me that what I'm doing is the right thing and I am not messing up my life right now, because honestly I'm afraid :c"
Loneliness,"Im a 14m and have dealt with depression (on medication for that now) and have been on winter break for the past week and a half. I'm kindof introverted but have been slowly coming out of my shell so to speak for the past year or so and this has made me very dependent on my friends but anyway, I rarely see my friends outside of school and am feeling very lonely and that is leading more and more to depression. Are there any recommendations on what I should do or if. I should ask for more anti-depressants or just try to wait it out until school rolls back around"
I don't know what to do,"I want to know if it is normal. I was an abused child from all sides and I lost my confidence in everything but at the same time I got tired of being alone ... I found a girl who is exactly like me ...  she is sweet and understanding.  I like her, I just don't feel those butterflies, that burning, you know, that feeling when you're in love ... I think it's because of my fear of giving someone confidence ... I don't know how I feel.  What to do?"
How do I make friends?,"The important part is the second part

This is really sad but How do I make friends. Making friends in hs is so much harder than other grades and I just entered a new district. Everyone already knows each other and have they're groups. I dont like approaching groups since I dont want to just interrupt them and it would be super awkward having a strange kid just walk up to you and your friends, stare at you, and try to join your conversation. Because of this I dont have any friends and just a few acquaintances and I sit alone for lunch everyday. It didnt bother me at first but it begins to suck more and more as time goes on.

I feel like the hardest part for me is making and holding conversations. It's been such a long time since I've had to talk to someone I didn't know and didn't know me that it's really hard. It's hard for me find topics to talk about . And if we don't have the same interest what then? It just leads to awkward silence. I'm bad at keeping the conversation going so sometimes people will ask me things and I awnser without thinking and dont ask ""You?"" so it just stops there. Its been such a long time since I've har a chance to be myself that I dont remember how to be myself so I'm not as funny or entertaining. How do I fix these problems?"
How to get over boys?,"I’ve been having a rough guy streak. Some months ago I got out of a three year relationship, then a guy ghosted me, his friend tried to hook up with me, a boy became obsessed with me, a guy tried to pay me to kick him (wtf), and now I’m talking to another guy (not romantically, just getting to know each other, but I don’t want to get hurt). I just want guys off my mind but I’m a romantic at heart and fall easily. How can I just take a break?"
biased teachers,"my math teacher is my assistant coach of my basketball team sometimes and i’m getting an I (incomplete) in his class. He’s never told me i couldn’t play basketball??? He’s super biased and only likes athletic kids but i’m still failing his class? every time i ask for help he says “that’s ur problem,” should i talk to him about it? how do i?"
Please help me,"I don't really know what I'm doing as I write this. Maybe it's just the last thing I haven't tried. Maybe I just need to say it out loud. I don't know, but here goes regardless. What you are reading is the uncensored, unfiltered process of my mind. I have never been this vulnerable to anyone, even myself, but I feel like I need to be vulnerable somehow to someone, and this is the only way I can think to do it.

My name is Tyler Cooper. I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, but since then I have lived in San Antonio and Maryland, respectively. I am 17 when I write this, going on 18 in three months. I add this incredibly personal information not only to tell you who I am as a human, but also to force myself to say things I instinctively hide.

I fell in love with someone who barely knew my name. She was the prettiest, smartest, kindest, and brightest person I ever met. Her megawatt smile used to be the only thing I looked forward to when I woke up at 4:00 each morning for early morning classes before school. Despite this, we never hung out. I wasn't 16 yet and my parents would have torn my spine out if I dated anyone before then, so I tried my best to keep things casual but it went nowhere fast. I knew where the line was between friend and stalker, and I was dangerously close to it. By the time I finally had my 16th birthday, not even 2 weeks before the day, my family packed up and moved to Maryland so my mom could continue her PhD. I was a wreck. Still am, some nights. I was so desperate I tried to start a relationship long distance to keep in touch, but all that did was burn that bridge entirely. I definitely came off as creepy, and in her shoes, I would do the same thing. I tried so damn hard to move on. I went on half a dozen dates with random girls whom I could tolerate, but just didn't connect with. I can't go back to San Antonio, where she lives. I don't have any chance at a career there without changing some major life decisions, and even if I did, I would be stupid to think she would take a chance on me after how I acted. She's probably already gone steady with someone by now, though it kills me to admit it. 

This isn't fair. I'm ruining myself over someone else. She didn't do anything wrong. She didn't mean to hurt me this badly. This is all my fault, because I'm an idiot and a hopeless romantic who has no clue in his walnut-sized skull how to move on from a lost cause. My grades are plummeting. I'm not eating as much as I'm supposed to. I tried dating other people and making new friends, but after a year of that I just want to be left alone. I tried suicide probably a dozen times, each time getting saved by a miracle. My therapist is trying so hard to help and he is doing a fantastic job, but no matter how hard I try I can't get past this one person. She means everything to me, even now. I used to feel butterflies anytime I thought of her. Now it's more like moths, filling me up so I want to vomit, acting as a cruel reminder of what should have been, but because of me, became something worthless.

She was lightyears out of my league for sure. She was beautiful. Hot, even, but she was so much more. She was ivy-league smart and friendly enough to make Robin Williams look coarse. She started wearing glasses during 6th grade that made her face shine even brighter, but when she eventually traded them for contacts, somehow that was even more radiant than before. Still, I liked to think I had a chance. I had to think that, in a way. There wasn't much choice, or so I assumed back then. She never once said a single word that lowered my self esteem. Even when she rejected me over text, she was kind and polite and understanding in ways no one else ever was to me. Even my closest family have never come close. Directly, she couldn't harm a fly, but indirectly, by virtue of simply being perfect, she ruined relationships for me. How can I possibly love someone who gets angry too easily or can't hold a conversation when I know that SHE exists? I judge people harsher than they deserve, because I've seen someone that no one could compare to, including myself.

I don't want sympathy. I have a therapist for that. I don't want a pep talk or any meditation or hypnosis tricks. Trust me, if you've heard of it, or even thought of it, I've already tried it 6 times. If you want to give me advice, just make sure you bring the receipt cause I've probably heard it a thousand times before. In all honesty, what I'm asking for is a miracle. Call this a prayer, if you will. A desperate scream into the void of the internet from a shattered boy who wishes he could love. I don't care if a million people see this. I don't care if 2 people see it. All I want is some hope that I will fall in love, and at this point the closest thing I have to love is faith. It may seem stupid at first, but I've seen the internet grant wishes before. I've seen medical bills paid and trees planted and even lives saved by communities of total strangers. I ask for a miracle, yes, but not a big one. I don't need someone to remove a tumor or save a village or send a satellite into space. I just need someone to tell me why everything will be okay. And yes, that would be a miracle.

Because I already know it won't be."
"Hey Reddit Users, Help a Heart-broken Brother out will ya?","Yeah like the title says i went through a pretty messy break up with a girlfriend of 7 years that i am trying to salvage what i can of our relationship.

Should I 12F ask out my crush 12M or not?,I don’t know if I should tell my crush whether or not I like him cause we talk everyday and he walks me to the bus and yesterday he asked me for my number to send memes. Should I tell him or not HELP!
my friend has a giant crush on me and its starting to make me uncomfortable (sorry this is long),"i have had this friend since my freshman year (we are seniors now) and we used to have a crush on eachother and flirted, but then i got over it and we kind of grew apart. he still had a crush on me the next year, even though i had a boyfriend but he never made a move, so i forgot about it.

later we ended up in the same friend group, and i thought he got over the crush, but i was wrong. hes also my manager at work now, and he gives me more hours than anyone, rearranges the schedule unfairly so i can call out last minute, etc. my coworkers have noticed it and its making them mad, and its effecting my friend group too.

the worst part is my friends decided we want to get eachother presents for Christmas, and apparently he got me something worth way more than anyone elses. 

he keeps asking to hang out alone and i either just say no or make up am excuse, because i know he wants to ask me out, but im not interested in him like that at all. he doesnt take a hint, and is super vague when he tries to ""ask me out"", and he gets upset when i hang out with others alone but not him.

i dont know what to do when he gives me his present, and i dont know what to say when he asks me out, and i sure as hell dont know what to do about work. he wont take a hint even though its pretty clear rhat im not into him, and its going to be so embarrassing to do this, i feel so bad.

does anyone have any advice, or has ever been in a similar situation?? thanks !!!

On the way the I fell asleep on the girl I like. When I woke up we was at the movies. She said that she was cold so I gave her my jacket and we sat by each other and the movies. About 1/4 the way in to the movie she put her head on my shoulder,so I did the same. Then after like 15 minutes I put my hand on the armrest thingy and she put her on top of mine and we held hands for the rest of the movie. On the way home we slept on each other and held hands.

Living with my mother is ruining our relationship,"Hi there, I’m 19 and I still live at home and lately my mother has become so unbearable. Me and my mom have always been really close but living with her is impossible, I don’t even know where to start. 
First of all my mom is really weird about the house being clean and tidy. She works full time and I can understand that coming home to a clean house is something that is appealing to her. I am the only person in the house who doesn’t work also so I understand where her expectations come from. I mostly stay with my boyfriend over night every night at his and then come back to mine in the morning to walk my dog and just have some time to myself. Normally I WILL tidy up all of the dishes that her, my brother and my dad used in the morning and just around the kitchen and the living room. Cool whatever. However today I generally just forgot to clean their dishes and I sh* t you not there was literally one plate a few forks and knives a cup and a grater. I came home at 11 am walked my dog and started painting. I love painting and I was really excited this new painting ive been doing so naturally I spent a good few hours on it. She came home and started shouting at me because I never did the dishes. Honestly if you were a third person watching the way my mum behaves sometimes you would think she was just joking. She just get so engulfed with rage when the house isn’t perfect and tidy and clean and its really affecting me now because the only time she ever opens her mouth it is to complain or shout. No one else thinks the house is messy its just her. And whenever I do do something for her there is no acknowledgement there she just expects it from me.Im so sick and tired of it I was having such a good day and then as soon as she walks in the door the nice energy in the room just disappears and its just poisoned with her constant nagging and negativity. After listening to her getting all up in my face telling me how lazy and selfish I am I try to explain to her the way she makes me feel and the way she behaves and she will just shut me down, walk away or slam a door in my face. She’s always the victim in everything and Im always the selfish lazy bitch of a daughter who doesn’t think of anyone else ever. The only reason I’m spending more time at home is because she told me to. She said I was spending too much time with my boyfriend and that she barely got to see me which honestly is probably for the best. She will go nuts if there are fingerprints on the fridge... I dont know but I feel thats a bit extreme. Im so done with it its just getting old and she only seems to be getting worse as time goes on. Usually I avoid confrontations with her and just do as she expects of me but its days like this where I slip up that literally make me want to run away so far from this house. My boyfriends mom is so chill and her daughter has cystic fibrosis so she is a stay at home mom. She is always so calm and her energy is amazing, im sure the last thing thats on her mind when she goes to sleep at night is if there are any dishes left in the sink and whos getting it in the morning....
I wish my mum could realize how much life she is WASTING by moaning all the time over such miniscule things, and how much it affects our family. No one wants to be around her when shes like that, but its just the way she is.
I know its a terrible thing for me to compare my mom to my bf’s but she’s just so much nicer to be around in a house environment.  Is there any way for me to just accept the way my mom is and for me to block out whenever she’s being difficult? I love her so much but I can’t live with her anymore:(( please help"
Pls help I’ve liked her for years,"K so a bit about me: female, 17, going into senior year. 
I’ve liked this girl since we were in freshman year. We were really close friends in middle school. We went to different high schools and kept in touch over the phone. I started liking her slowly in freshman year and eventually it kept getting worse as we kept talking and meeting up. (She is also gay btw). At first I thought I could ignore it and it would pass but it’s been nearly 3 years and I like her more ughhhh. Im pretty sure she sees my as a little sister type friend. For next year (senior year) we are going to the same school and we have been talking a lot more and seeing each other more often. This is definitely me over analyzing but recently she’s been a bit more touchy and even kinda asked to give me a hickey when we got drunk at a party lol. But she did tell me about a girl she said she might like. So I don’t really think she likes me that way. Ok I don’t want to sound all “dramatic teenage girl” but I do have a couple mental health issues I guess, and she kind of knows about them? But like not in depth. I always tell her not to worry and nothing is wrong because I feel bad putting a burden like me on her but I’m pretty sure she knows I’m lying so I’m pretty pissed at myself for letting her know that much because now she probably pities me and I really don’t want that. It’s a really complicated thing and I just don’t want to like her that way. Even in the nonexistent chance she felt the same, I’d feel guilty dating her because I’d kind of drag her down because she’s just such an amazing person and I’m not. (Wow sorry this sounds so dramatic lol). Hell I even feel guilty being friends with her because I don’t like making her worry or pity me. But the worst part is that if I had any chance to date her, my selfish, dumb self would go for it in an instant. If I asked her out it would just look so pathetic on my part since she already probably sees me as impulsive, damaged, and childlike. Ugh sorry I’m dumping a 3 year long complex onto the person reading this. 

Ok so now that I unloaded my cringeworthy girl issues and other personal issues on the poor reader, what the hell am I supposed to do?? I’m still trying to get over her and she has no idea I like her. Do I tell her?? Should I ask her out? Should I wait it out? Am I overanalyzing?? I just kind of feel like shit and really need some advice on how to deal with this situation."

Weight,"I'm a male teen trying to lose weight. I'm going on a diet and cant access a gym, i wanted to know if there are any good exercises that i can do from my own house without having to buy any equipment? What are the best ones to do to lose weight? How often should i do them? Thanks"
"18, and forced to wear the hijab since I was 12, idk what to do anymore.","So when I was about 12 I put on the hijab by house because I wanted to make my parents happy. A few months later I regretted it and told them I wanted to remove it. They wouldn’t let me and threatened me their 12 year old daughter to be homeschooled or to go live in a Muslim third world country. Since I’m very passionate about my education I left it on but removed at school through out middle school. Starting high school I left it on because I didn’t want to go through the drama of being caught without it and stuff again. I’m 18 and still in high school. Universities choices are coming up, my parents want me to go to a university close to them and of course never move out “Because that’s not allowed in Islam you should always have a male guardian”. I’m sick of their religious bullshit, they love more than anything and they think they are doing the best for me but I’m not even Muslim anymore. Idk what to do right now. So the real question is do I choose my happiness of theirs? Since bought cannot co-exist knowing that they love me and sacrificed their lives to sent me to the best schools etc.."
"Hello, im 13 and i need advice because I see things others don’t and I don’t know how to tell my family","So lately I have been seeing black cloud my vision during class and it is really strange but that's not all of it. Randomly, sometimes during conversations, I get a strange feeling when I look at my hands and other people. They don't feel real. I don't know why. I'll even respond but it's not me speaking... Or it doesn't feel like me speaking. It's like someone is taking over my body. I sometimes see black when I'm moving quickly or when I focus on one thing. I don't know how to tell my parents and my counselors at school recommend I should get a doctor and that I should tell my parents but I don't know how.
 Edit: my mom came home and apparently my counselor told her about it so she booked a doctors appointment tomorrow and she is telling my dad, I'm scared *•* 
It’s been a year since this post and I have been diagnosed with severe depression just recently."
I don't know if I should tell my therapist or not.,"I think a lot about my past looking for reasons as to why I'm the anxious, depressed, and emotional person I am. I used to be incredibly aggressive as well as a child but now I don't even like to yell. Any sort of aggression around me throws me into this frightened panic mode and i begin to frantically search for a way out of the situation. I say I think about my past because... as a kid, I was highly aggressive and threw lots of tantrums even at the age of 13. My mom would discipline me severely and that's all I  thought it was. Discipline. I only began to question it after I turned 17 and am still uncertain of it now at the age of 19. As a child I was diagnosed with RAD (Reactive Attachment Disorder) and I'm not sure if I still have it or if it's gone. I'm also diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When my mom spoke to my therapists, she wouldn't hesitate to tell them every single thing I did, whether it be acting out or having no remorse, though she never told them what she did in response and I didn't tell my therapist about what happened at home either. I was afraid of more discipline or my mom getting in trouble resulting in even worse discipline. My mom, to this day, guilt trips me for my behavior as a kid. Asking where she went wrong and if she was a bad parent and why did God give her such misbehaving children. Sorry for the rant, I just want for anyone able to answer to get a vague understanding of my past as a kid before I ask. One of these days where I was incredibly angry and wanted to be left alone, my mother persisted on bothering me and further agitating me when i just wanted to be left alone to calm down and I stated so. This was when I was 12. She ignored my plea/request and continued to yell at me and it got to the point where her boyfriend came upstairs to see what was up. I heatedly kept telling them to please just leave me alone and tried to fight my way past them since they were making no moves to leave. My mom, already in a defensive mood, got more angry and started to wrestle with me and hold me down. I tried to get away but she told her boyfriend to hold me down and he helped her in doing so.  He held my wrists with my arms outstretched above my head and she had her entire body weight on my legs. Mind you, I was merely 12... I'm sure none of this was necessary but at the same time... anyways, my mom kept repeating the question ""Are you going to calm down?"" Over and over as i cried splayed in that position because it's what I was trying to do in the first place. I was held there on the floor by my bed for 3 hours. Before the three hour mark, my mom force fed me Tylenol to ""calm me down"" even though I had already given up on trying to move.  When she asked her question ""Are you going to calm down?"" Again, I answered ""Yes"" weakly and defeatedly so I could get some feeling back into my hands and legs. When they let go and I was finally able to move, I stayed on the floor and curled into a ball and cried because my arms and legs hurt when I moved them after being stuck that  way for so long. They went back downstairs and I passed out either from crying, or all the tylenol she gave me. So my question to the answerer is, Does that count as abuse? My mom has been extremely disciplinary my whole life. I'm not sure anymore though. I only began questioning it 3 years ago. I just don't know for sure and I don't want to talk to my therapist about it incase it's nothing.  I just really want to get to the bottom of my mental and emotional issues so I can have a long lasting and healthy relationship because trusting and speaking out to my significant other is very difficult and he's very patient but the way I am is unhealthy and I know that. I don't want my relationship or future relationships with friends and family  to be ruined because of my fears and inability to address my feelings. "
it is my bday and nobody remembered,"It is 2 am and nobody celebrated my bday except my mom and two of her friends and it is my sweet 16. I know it is not even morning yet and this sounds lame but my snap streaks can see its my bday because a cake appears next to my name. I know this is not a big problem I am not sad just because of this I am sad because the people I care about so much doesnt care about me, I saw this through years. I feel lonely, I feel very depressed and I feel like if people really try to get to know me better they will like me. Also, I am 16 now and I still haven't had my first kiss. Is this bad? How can I socialize more and be more extrovert? Can you give me some advice I really do feel alone."
i (17f) am terrified of relationships but i want one? HELP!,"so, i am 17 years old and only have one year of high school left, but i have never been in a relationship. and okay i get it, i'm just 17 and have lots of time ahead of me, but when everyone around me has had their first kiss, been in relationships, etc. it makes me feel pathetic. i haven't even held a guys hand!!!! 

I don't fit in.
I don't like huge parties and those crazy nights sneaking out. I don't like it. i do have anxiety and other things which affect how i feel, but still... idk. 

but my problem that i need advice on is: whats wrong with me?? i really want a relationship but i'm too scared. this boy really liked me for a long time and i DID like him back, but as soon as things got more serious and he mentioned me being a ""girlfriend"" and hanging out all the time and stuff, i panicked. i pushed him away. yet i sit here and complain to people about how alone and unloved i am, and that alllll i want is a guy to love me. but when someone does, i throw them away and hide. 
like, this guy i legit was head over heel for and OBSESSED with didn't show interest in me for like a year, i was so upset and devastated it ruined my life. i honestly loved him (dont say i din't because trust me i know that im only 17.... but trust me, i did). but now he is showing interest in me and im absolutely terrified. he asked me to hangout next week and i think im gonna run and hide, but i don't wanna..... i want him so baly but im so scared!! im gonna ruin it like i always do... HELP!!

i feel so different, like an outsider. i look at things differently. 
i dont like parties, sneaking out, and all that ""teenager high school rebellious"" stuff. i dont like it. i dont like crowds or anything, i would rather be alone than out at parties. 
and i dont wanna have sex or anything, i am not ready. and i know i dont have to do that with anyone under any circumstances but it feels like all guys i know expect it. like its a requirement most people have that i can't meet. im scared everyone i like is gonna try it and i will embarrass myself whe i pull away and say no.  
yet, i think about it and occasionally want it, but I DONT. like i wont do it, im not ready. but i dont even know. 
i just feel so screwed up and complicated and alone in the world. 
i want someone to hold me and cuddle all the time, not someone just to get dirty with. 
im into relationships for the personal soul connection stuff, not for someones body. 
but im too scared.

i am also terrfified to kiss someone. like what if i mess it all up and they hate me. not worth it. 
i think im so scared of failing that i would rather not try at all.
like when someone takes a photo of me i make a funny face because to me, looking crazy on purpose is better than trying to look good but looking just as bad. it is kinda like that..? 
i have severe anxiety, depression, and OCD, and i dont know what to do. 
this guy who asked me to hangout knows a lot about me, he knows my past with suicide, he knows my ocd and anxiety are bad, he knows i have a hard time, but he doesn't know THIS. because i DO wanna kiss him, but im too scared. 

why am i so scared... :( i wanna be normal like everyone else........ im just pathetic, HELP!!!!! "
Tad confused in regards to recent changes(not sure if really late puberty),"When I say late puberty I'm male and currently almost 17 and all around the same time things that often take place during puberty have started. First off I went through puberty within the space of a few months when I was 11, It took 3 days for my voice to fully break(freaked the hell out of everyone) and a further 3 months aprox for leg hair ect. However I never developed an attraction to girls nor facial hair(I also stopped growing but that might be normal I'm 5 foot 10). During the summer a few things happened: first I began to grow facial hair, second after my emotions going a tad haywire(bouncing between depression and hyperactivity for almost a month) I started to realize that I'm now finding girls attractive, Despite having stopped growing while I was 12 recently my shoulders are becoming wider and my arms longer, I also have been told that my face has started to become narrower and that I appear to be losing weight(I'm quite healthy in regards to weight but suddenly my apatite is bigger and I'm told I'm losing weight) This seems similar to what I experienced before I had my growth spurt as a kid.

My main question is does what is happening seem like what I think it is? (Is it possible for puberty to kind of pause for several years?)"
"Dear Reddit, I am in need of someone with more experience than I.","I am in a bit of a pickle, and rather confused, if that is what you'd like to call it. I am not very, hmmm, knowing of all of these terms associated with the transgender, crossdressing community. (I haven't really looked up on it, mostly because I am ashamed that I will hurt my family)
Basically, here is my problem. I am a 16 year old young woman, but all of my life I have felt I want to be a boy! Not to uncommon, hence the subreddit I am deciding to post in. BUT. I still like guys. I have no desire to be with a woman, I still very much enjoy men. Very girlyish men you could say. I tend to find myself crushing on gay men especially, who have no desire to be with a woman at all.
It doesn't end there, either. I am currently with a man, who is 19 years old, and we have been together for 2 years. He does not know about my desire to be a boy, and I have held back from telling him because he is completely straight. When I say ""be a boy"", I want to keep my woman parts but dress as a boy, and identify as a boy. I need some advice reddit! As you could imagine, I have no one to talk to directly that I wouldn't be extremely embarrassed to admit this little problem I am in.
Thanks in advance, Reddit has always been helpful to me. (:"
Low self confidence,"Well i dont know what's the reaon but i feel like i have extremly low self confidence, the kind where you don't know where to look when you'r walking so that you look normal, the kind where you feel tired all the time from social interaction. a lot of times i find myslef sitting along just cause i don't know what to do how to go and start a conversation and so on.

Even though i can say i'm quite a successful person and so do other say sometimes, i still have this low self confidence for some reason and it's realy annoying cause i feel like i'm not fulfilling myself i feel like i'm such a success but my self confidence is driveing me back.

so any advice? im pretty helpless 

(sorry for any english mistakes i'll be happy if you'll point them out so i could improve...)"
"My friend in saying hes going to 
shoot up the school. Please reply.",My friend told me he was. But if I tell he will shoot me.. is there any way I could talk him down..
Need help with friends,I have a small circle of real friends that I would ask to hangout but I never really keep in contact with. During the school year a lot of people said they wanted to hangout in summer but nothing at all came up and its not even a month until school starts again. I text people sometimes but never really hangout with them and as far as I know I'm not hated or anything. Even my best friend I haven't heard from in week until yesterday I found out he is taking UFC classes and learning Italian and Portuguese we never talked about any of that before. And even my girlfriend and I don't talk much. I feel like no one cares about me anymore maybe I am alone?  
Do guys like receiving stuffed animals as presents just as much as girls do?,"I got my boyfriend a build a bear for his birthday, but I'm not sure if this is a fail present or not. Is it bad that I chose my favorite animal because I thought it'd be nice since it'll remind him of me?"
Shy guy problems,I'm kind of shy so I don't necessarily get my feelings out to the lady folk because I think that they will reject me. I finally did give my feelings out to one person I have a crush on. She liked my back but not the point. I don't know anything about dating. I simply said I liked her and she liked me back. Anything you guys can tell me about first dates? I'm Hopeless!
My Funny Moment.,Today I had to run the mile. It wasn't that hard but I saw this kid that I didn't know and he had his shirt over his face and tripped. Not much of a story but it was hilarious. How bout you guys?
What I do after school.,Pretty much play Minecraft or CoD (I'm a god at sniping) Then sleep. Then dinner then homework then bed. How bout you? :P
Moving Out.,"Good Morning Reddit,

I am a 18 year old young man, soon to be 19 and i am thinking about moving out of the house. My father has up to now been paying for everything for me besides gas (Food, Insurance, Phone etc.). But he gets very  harsh sometimes, and I have been talking about moving out. I work in the technology industry for Cisco making 10$ an hour until i can get some certifications. Right now i have lined up around a 1000$ apartment with three friends of mine all with stable incomes who i have known since grade school. After adding up all other costs to live i picture it to be about 1100$ to 1300$ a month to get by which leaves me with about 400 or 500$ a month extra. Right now i am finishing up my first year in college but I'm not doing the best because i also work at McDonald's -_- in total i push around 60 hours a week and every time they offer help at my school it's always at inconvenient times. Also i spend around 400$ a month right now in gas, which is another reason I'd like to move because the apartment will be within biking distance to both my office and McDonald's. Basically i think I'll be able to survive without going under an living paycheck to paycheck. Does anyone have any experience or advice into this subject? 

Thank you,

Brian"
Need girl help,"So I'm friends with these two girls that both like me. One is a blonde, really fun and energetic, decent face, not really any body, and the other is a brunette, good face, good body, but she can be really bitchy at times. Oh, and they are best friends. How divide which one to go after, and without hurting the others feelings?"

Slight random dull aches in testicle with no other signs,"I've recently been experiencing random dull aches in my left testicle, that never show up at a certain time of day, with no other warning signs. The pain is not severe, there are no visual lumps or swelling, and I do not have any family history of testicular cancer. I do however have bad medical anxiety and white coat syndrome so i was wondering if anyone could help me out. 

P.S, I am 13 years of age, which is also out of the normal age range for testicular cancer (still tho, I got a panic attack over ear pains, my medical anxiety is bad).

Quick Clarification: I realize now that ""dull ache"" is an actual medical term that is even worse pain than i am experiencing. Both my mom and dad told me that as my body grows I will experience moments of slight discomfort (a more accurate way of describing how It feels) in that certain area."
I need your help- Just boredom and a loss of will,"I'm sure that my friends at school have similar problems because we talk about it a lot, but I was wondering if its an epidemic problem for other teenagers across the world, or just for my school.

I'm turning 17 in around a month and have noticed a huge, for me anyway, problem that has occurred for around 1-2 years. I'm just incredibly bored.

My other friends watch anime all day, watch Netflix, draw, read or whatever and everything just seems incredibly boring to do. I lost my 3 main friends after finishing my GCSE exams as they all parted to either jobs or other colleges, and have been trying to fit in with another group of friends, which is realistically going pretty well, but have only been friends with them for around 6 months. I ask to play video games, go to the movies or go around each other houses but they say that its boring, and frankly, i agree with them. Everything that used to give me joy now seems boring and gives me a feeling of nothingness, a feeling that can only be descirbed as nothing/boring/pointless. I really want to do things to make me happy again, but it feels like ive lost all feelings within my body, my friends have a similar feeling, it also doesnt help that most of the exiting stuff is also pretty expensive. The main problem is that most of the other friend groups at school seem to have a similar a problem as i speak of it regularly to them.

Is this a normal feeling or do i have a craving for affection from friends. I ask ""do i have a craving for affection from friends"" as the recent break from school, lasting for 1 week, i was INCREDIBLY bored, and by the 4th day i couldnt bear it, and just wanted to curl into a ball, lay there silently and wait until this feeling went away. I found that my eating habits went to sh!T, eating only 1 meal per day and just silently wallowing in my own sorrow for the remaining 5 days. I found that even a message from friends was enough to satisfy me for another few hours, but then these feeling would begin to come back and i would just crave for another message/interaction/notifiation from my friends.

I know these are symptoms of mental health problems, but my main quesiton is, Why do these feeling go away from simple messages/talking to my friends or even random strangers on the internet? Is it me being clingy to my friends? is this completly normal? do i have a form of a mental problem?

&#x200B;

Any advice would be greatly appreciated on this subject .

Tips for overcoming stage fright? First Talent Show,"I just moved to a new school this august and I’ve had a hard time adjusting. I’m a good student, so my grades are fine, and getting around isn’t actually any trouble. I’m even in a club. I’ve just had a hard time getting close to anyone since they’ve all know each other since elementary school (kinder to highschool are basically on the same campus, a parking lot separates them). 

In April my school will be holding a poetry/music night and I’m considering auditioning for it. The thing is, I’ve never been on stage, save for middle 
school orchestra, piano recitals, and one really bad open mic experience when I was 14. 

I think it’d be a good opportunity to get myself out there, work on my public speaking / performance, and maybe I’d meet people from it, but I have really bad anxiety over it. Im also scared that if I do end up letting my nerves get the best of me and mess it all up, it’ll just isolate me more than I already am. 

I told two friends I was considering it and they both said I should give it a shot, but I’m thinking that I might just be biting off more than I can chew or Im getting overconfident and overestimating my skills?

I don’t know, should I just go for it? And if I should, how do I work on decreasing my anxiety over it?"
Friend group separating,"Ok so my group in high school used to be me ( f 19), M ( m 17 ) , V (f 18) , N ( F 18) , k ( f18) and S ( f 18) and recently we got in an awkward situation. 

I’ve always liked M but m and v started dating I was a little frustrated at the beginning and I acted out. I thought more about it and regretted be jealous. I apologized to both of them and tried to be better friend with v ( m was my best friend). V ignored me for a couple months but idc that much. During Christmas I decided to throw a party and I didn’t invite her ( i asked m if it was okay and he said it was fine ) turns out it was not fine. She decided to throw a party the same day. Once I figured out I canceled my party and apologized to her. After that I tried being nice to her and she ignored me and talked shit about me behind my back. I didn’t tell anyone because I thought no one would believe me ( she is seemingly really nice ) N and S came up to me and they have told me that k and v have been talking a lot of shit about me and them. Me n and s tried to fix the situation but they kept on ignoring us. We just thought oh well. Then we started talking to M. V got really mad at us for talking to M even thought me and him been friends since I was 11. We have been trying to schedule a day so we can all talk together but they just keep making up excuses. S birthday is coming up and she didn’t invite k and v to her party because they have been saying so much shit about her. V is making m choose her or us and Idk what to do. Any advice. Sorry if this was confusing"

&#x200B;

So I live with my grandparents and they are Jehovah's Witnesses. After growing up with their religion I have chosen to not be in it. I am the only child in the whole family still ""in the religion"" and they have called me their only hope which puts pressure on me that I don't want. I have tried before to tell them I don't want to be a part of their religion but when I did they said I was disappointing them after all they have done for me (if i didn't go to when them when I was a year old then i would have gone to my mothers grandparents who i don't know.) and my grandma even cried. Before confessing this I have indiscreetly asked what they would do if I didn't want to be a witness and they said that as long as I am under their house they would take me to church if i wanted to go or not. Growing up in the ""truth"" I know for a fact that Jehovah's Witnesses believe that no one should be forced into their religion.  I was planning on leaving the religion and getting a job at 16 to save up money to be able to live after 18 as they will probably kick me out. But after confessing the first time and seeing their sadness I begun thinking that me wanting to do my own thing is wrong and that I should just suck it up and be unhappy but make them happy which is what I have been doing. Also if I continue to go after becoming inactive people would look at me with disappointment which would hurt me emotionally. I seriously don't know what to think about this so any advice at all is happily welcomed and worshiped."
Help I’m becoming an incel,"I am 16 in junior year and it’s happening, I realize I am becoming a simp and an incel. I have come a long way though. In the last 3 years I have gone from a tiny twig to a big muscular powerlifter. I did this because I was bullied and found an outlet. But my self loathing and anxiety has all but shrunk. I have gotten nowhere romantically despite being attractive and pretty jacked. I have no confidence in myself and every time I’m not in the gym and I’m in class I feel like myself from 3 years ago, tiny and scrawny. I notice that I am starting to have simp and incel tendencies badly and my friends notice too. Everyone in my friend group is no longer a virgin. I have done literally nothing. I have discovered the “red pill” idea of being alpha but doesn’t get me anywhere, I just have what they call “red pill rage” I don’t know what parts of my behavior to change to get people to take interest in me. I want to get to know girls and see where that takes me but I cannot have conversations with them because I’m scared. Anyone who has gone through this and made it out, how did you do it?"
Please help,"I can never accept compliments or validation, as a kid I was never enough for my parents. I was always compared to my older sister who was perfect in their eyes and was forced to be an example for my brother to follow putting me at the blame of he ever screwed around because I should be teaching him better. Once I got older I stopped caring about the executions of people who would never be satisfied like my parents but even then I kept the feelings of never being good enough. Now we there people compliments my art, looks, or personality I have to dryly say thank you but can never truly believe it because my brain makes an excuse that im not good enough. No matter how many times people or friends try the feelings are hurried that I am and will never be good enough."
Why am I so conflicted?,"Um, I'm not very good at starting posts, so I'll just start talking about my problem.

So, I'm new to being a teen (turned 13 a while ago) but I can tell I already want to be different. So many of the people at my school are the same. You have the nice people, the 6th graders, the sporty ones, and the ones that don't really fit anywhere else, but, from the looks of things, I'm the only one who is excessively concerned about my future. For the past five years, I've been trying to get noticed, prepare for that big day when I finish the project, but I've gotten almost nowhere. I'm not even half done with it, and I want to do it, but I can't stop procrastinating! Heck, managing to revise what I had made me happier than I had been for the last three months.

Now, for the conflicts, I'll just list them out:

•I don't want to fall in love or anything, but I keep falling for fictional characters

•I constantly daydream and lie about working on things in my head, but I spend weeks (even months) perfecting every detail, even when I daydream about real-life situations

•I like working, but all I do is procrastinate

•I stay up all night so I can work, but I continue to procrastinate, because I don't remember my dreams anymore, and I find sleep pointless, but I like the sleeping experience

•As soon as I try working on one thing, I immediately begin to work on a new project

So, uh, I'm causing myself a lot of stress for almost no reason whatsoever, and I can't seem to stop.

im kinda new to using reddit so any general advice is appreciated, i just need to write this all down somewhere because i feel like im gonna go crazy if i dont

and slowly as the year's been going by i took to being super mean to him, swearing at him and spraying water at him, scribbling on his papers, and whipping chalk or shoes or whatever else at him... and its always me who starts acting nasty first, but he doesnt hesitate to reciprocate, although hes really shy and not too talkative

and i dont hate him and ive never hated him,,i actually really like him and ive begun to notice it more and more the past few weeks

i cant get myself to throw stuff at him anymore, or destroy his papers, but now when i see him i dont know what to do if it isn't something nasty, i genuinely just dont know what to say to him

he isn't one to initiate conversations but i really wanna restart with him and get closer to him because hes really sweet, i found a way to partner up with him during class once and i made it look like it was random, but i got to work with him and talk a bit and hes super chill, plus when im nice to him hes nice to me back, he sorta just reciprocates my energy

but outside of that class i cant find words to tell him that arent mean, i just get snappy and defensive for no reason to him even though inside i feel rlly warm n fuzzy being around him, and ive realized that im obviously attracted to him,i think about him all the time,

except i dont know how to interact with him in a way which conveys my interest in him, especially given everyhting ive already done to him

im already horrible when it comes to the whole flirting situation, and i have no clue how to switch from being a bully to a person that is pleasant to be around

idk how to reflect my interest towards him through my words/actions heLP

TLDR: im mean asf to the guy i like and idk how to change my behaviour around him, i wanna show interest but i never know what to say or do ,, where do i start?"
Second guessing my friendships,"I'm in a situation where I'm 2nd guessing my group of friend. I feel like they tont give a crap about me, and that we've just grown apart. I feel like I've grown or them, and I dont know if to continue holding on or not, since I have no friends at my grade, I often hang out with seniors or college friends (I'm a HS junior). And I'm scared of having no one next year"
19 year Old dont know what to do,"im 19 currently studying auto tech and i started in January. not sure if I wanna work on cars for the rest of my life though. i know what ur thinking. why did you put yourself in the course if youre not sure? well im not sure myself, i had scenarios in my head of me doing this and that and working on cars but the more i gave it some thought the more i thought about my future and working and it just doesnt feel like this is for me. how did you guys figure out what you wanted to do? I thought about becoming a nurse maybe or doing something related to the public but my filipinop arents think im trying to escape my problems. i just think im trying to figure out who i am. thanks"
Am I ever gonna be a normal happy teenager?,"I posted here a few days ago and since then things have gotten worse. 

My thoughts have lead me to wanting weed and to run away over the past few days. Nothing unordinary has happened so I don’t understand what is wrong with me. 

My mood just switches so quickly, for example: earlier today my mum and I were watching tv and I lashed out because she started talking over the program. I wasnt even that invested in the program so I don’t understand why?

This night too (it’s currently 5:15am as im writing this) my mentality hasnt been the greatest. I’ve had thoughts about becoming annorexic or bullimic and each thought that has consumed me tonight has lead me to suicide. 

You’d think I’d be happy that I have group therapy sessions to go to over easter, or that I have a 1-2-1 therapy session coming up (Im on a 6 month waiting list for that). You’d think I’d be happy that I’ve come in contact with an old friend. You’d think i’d be happy that I have everything I’ve always wanted such as a puppy, a cat, a computer, a big room. But none of this stuff makes me happy at all and I don’t understand why. Why don’t I feel happy or privileged that these things are happening in my life? I really don’t understand. 

The only reason I think I’m unhappy is because of me, I’m me. Im fat, vile, disgusting. Im horrible to everyone, rude to everyone I meet. I dont listen to people, I dont listen to instructions. I zone out and get clouded with my thoughts then when I zone back in I feel terrible for missing what people say and I zone out again and tell myself “Im so stupid” or “Just f**king listen to them”. But I cant zone back in and its often too late when I do. Its the same with people giving advice. I can’t take it. I try to, I try so hard to but instead go back to old habbits that I cant seem to change. 

I’ve tried getting help from an online friend but he doesn’t seem to understand anymore, not like he used to. He helped me with issues with my ex, he calmed me down when my ex spoke about killing himself, he calmed me down when I thought this other girl was trying to get with my ex and he liked her too. But I lost everything with him because my anxiety spiraled out of control. No one knew how much I cried the five months I was so scared of losing my ex. I cried atleast twice a week. Two of the months I cried so much over him but he never cared. He’d just disappear and make me wonder again. He’d make me think he’d killed himself, or that he hated me. 

When we ended things, he proved how much he hated me. I was high when we officially brokeup but he’d hinted that he wanted that for weeks and I didn’t notice until I was stoned out of my mind and happy for the first time in so long. And its weird because I stayed happy for a few days after. The day we ended things he said he’d “found someone else” and said “she helped him when he was going through things”. And now I look back at that, I wish I was that person, I wish he loved me back and trusted me too. 

The past month I’ve been feeling what I didn’t when we brokeup. I’ve wanted to message him, show him how much I loved him. But was it really love? He didn’t love me back? So was it just an attachment? 

I get attached easily, I trust easily too. Thats something else thats wrong with me. I should know I can’t trust people when they’ve already given me a reason not to, but I just dive into the deepend and trust them all over again, I dont just dip my toe in to see if I can, I keep diving in and drowning all over again. Sometimes its the same people, sometimes its new people. But I let go of the anxiety for a moment then realise I’ve done this wrong again and it’s going to go terrible. 

Thats something I think about alot. I think about this when it starts to get dark, I think about how I cant get myself into college, I think about how much I weigh, I think about how ugly I look, I think about the scars on my arms, my stomach and legs. I think about everything. And then I can’t sleep at night. I can’t sleep until I pass out. 

Its a loop that is like a neverending tournado that I cant escape and Im stuck in going around and around. I cant sleep, so I can’t get myself to college. I cant get to college, so I cant see friends and people that make me happy. I cant see these people, so I get sad and selfharm. I selfharm and start eating to try and feel bettwr. Then I cant sleep because I ate at the wrong time. 

And I don’t know when its going to end. Maybe it’ll end when my sleep schedule becomes normal again? Maybe it’ll end when I learn to grow up? Maybe it’ll end when Im dead? 

To growup I need to be happy though right? To be dead i’d have to not be scared of killing myself? To fix my schedule.. I dont know. Im lost."
HELP ASAP,"ok so my “friends with benefits” boyfriend’s birthday is on Friday and I have no clue what to get him! He told me today that his birthday is on Friday so it’s super duper close and have no clue what to do! We enjoy the office (the show) but none  of the stores have what I want  and he likes legos (lol he’s turning 15 and is a geek hahaha) but they’re way too pricey in target and Walmart. So please could someone give me ideas on what to give him it would mean the world to me, thanks!"
Should I or Should I Not Go on a Potentially Amazing Trip,"Okay. I'm honestly extremely stressed out so please help me.

So every year my school goes on a trip, and I was able to attend last year's but this year's is extremely expensive -- $1,500 expensive.

The entire year I thought I wouldn't go, but my friends continued to talk about how much they wanted to go and ask why I'm not going so it started to pester me a bit.

There is an opportunity for me to hop in on the payments now, but the date is next month, and I'd have to earn it all in a month basically, instead gradually over an entire year.

There are fundraisers that we have, but it's hard to make real profit off of them. We have boxes of chocolate, but it takes a while to sell since there's 60 to a box, one box only gives $30 towards my account.

This whole trip thing stressed my mom out before we decided I wouldn't go, and now I'm bringing it up again so I feel like I'm making things worse.

I don't know how I'll be able to sell enough to really make a dent when I only earn $30 at a time, and I only have until the 22nd of next month! I went on the trip last year, and I have been where we are going now so the only new thing will be that I'm there with friends.

Can someone please tell me if this is all worth it?"
I don't know what to do now,"So I have a family of 5, my parents and my three sisters. I'm the youngest one out of the three. My mom just came downstairs to have a ""chat"" about the relationship between my sisters and I. My sisters both go the university while I'm still stuck in high-school. I usually can not get a conversation going with my mom because she thinks I have a bad attitude and don't try to make friends. I get really pissed off everytime my mom tells to change and make some friends at school. It's not like I don't try to make friends, but the girls in my grade are very materialistic and really enjoy gossiping. I'm not that type of person to go around and start spreading rumours. Therefore, I'm only acquaintances with the girls. I'm more better off talking to boys cause they're chill and fine with the jokes I make. After all, the guys don't take the things I say to heart. On the other hand, my mom doesn't like the idea of me having friends that are boys because they are guys. I have a cousin and that's like the closest friend I've got. However, I don't tell him my secrets because it's highly likely that he'll tell my sisters. My sisters are always busy cause they're in university. Sometimes they're not as busy, so we try to sit down and try to talk. Once I start talking another talks over me and completely ignores me. My mom always tells me to be nice and listen to others, but they don't do the same and take advantage of it. What can I do, can anyone tell me?"
Am I selfish? Any advice,"Hello again! I started this friends with benefits type with this new guy at my school. (Found out my old crush has a gf) and He recently confessed that he liked me.  He is super sweet and very different than most guys. So on Valentine’s Day I gave him a stuffed animal with some chocolates and he gave me homemade cookies, But...they were all smushed together and it was really sad looking. I’m just kinda upset about it since I showed him my love on that specific day. is that selfish to say even though I’m not trying to be? Am I asking for too much? I just didn’t feel loved at all and it seems like he’s the only one getting happiness, not me...please help"

Things girls do if they like you,Here are some things to pay attention too https://youtu.be/yFY_uOb7bRk
"This one's a little fucked up, but please help.","Ok to start things off, my parents are divorced. Dad hasn't got a different partner. My mom has got a new partner. He has 3 kids: 2 girls and 1 boy. The ""boy"" is already like 20 years old. Youngest sister is 14, oldest is 16. I'm 16 too. Now when my mom and her new partner started to take the relationship seriously, I went to their house, and they came over to ours. I got kinda close to the oldest sister. We told eachother that we wanted to kiss. One night, I don't remember why, the oldest sister was spending the night at my moms. Only my mom, the oldest sister and me were home. We were watching some netflix and my mom got tired so she went upstairs. We kinda sticked around a little longer than my mom told us too, and we kissed. We went upstairs only for her to come into my room (she had her own room and own bed to sleep in) and lay on my bed. I put myself next to her, we lied there for 5 mins when we started kissing again. (I'm thinking about it now and it's really fucked up, I kissed my stepsister basically) It was awkward when we saw eachother again the day after, and a week later when I saw her again, we basically said nothing to eachother. I asked her what was going on. She bluntly said:""There's nothing between us. ""I'm there sitting in my couch, staring at my phone and I'm like: what?"" I told her I thought that kiss meant something. She said she had kissed a guy the other night, maybe even more bluntly than before. Now I don't know what to do at all. I kinda want to tell her to fuck off, she should've told me earlier that this was just one of her ""many"" kisses. But the problem is, there's a very big chance she'll be my fucking sister for the rest of my life. Now I'm basically regretting everything I did. I'm thinking about how I could've spent the time with her, seeing a girl that actually wanted to be in a relationship with me. Now I'm basically lost for words because I've had somebody tell me before that they didn't like me and I just told them to politely fuck off. But I feel like I can't do that now because she's my sister. What should I do? I'm lost. If you've read this far, thank you for doing so and if you reply, a thousand thanks too."
Flirting or friendly?,"
There’s this girl in one of my classes that sits by me and my friends and I can’t tell if she likes me or not. Whenever I’m talking with my friends, if she over hears a question I asked and they don’t answer in time she will chime in if she knows the answer. That doesn’t make me think she’s flirty tho. In the halls we lock eyes (I can’t tell by accident or on purpose) and even in that class in the beginning of the period she usually faces to talk to us even though her friend is near by (talking distance). Sorry if this was long. First post but this has been going on for a while and I honestly am clueless when it comes to hints."
"I like one of my best friends in my trio and am afraid of saying so [M17, M18, F17]","So I've been best friends with the same to people for the last 2 years, mostly due to us swimming together for HS and being some of the few HS kids who take classes at our local college instead of at hs, which got lonely, hence our incentive to bond. One is a guy friend thats actually been basically my bff for 6 years, we're both current seniors, the other is a girl we met at the beginning of hs through a stem program and swim. For my FR year and some of SO year i had a crush on her friend and tried to have her set me up without much luck, towards the end of SO year i had a relationship that turned sour but she took my side over my ex's even with them being close friends. Pretty much ever since then ive thought of her as almost a sister because she supports me so much but i also found that she is one of my favorite people to be around and developed a crush on her. For too long to remember in this friendship ive denied any feelings knowing that i should see her as only my friend. Even if i thought otherwise i dont know how it would affect us as a group, they are my rock keeping me from depression most days and if i tried to date her it could ruin everything. She may so no and i rely on my best friend for the time being, or she may say she shares feelings and my best friend resents me for ruining the trio, which would fuck up even more things since our parents are planning a triple graduation party for us. And even if that doesnt happen, what if my best friend also had feelings for her. But even if it all works out, i know she has plans after graduating, and they don't involve staying in state near us for college. Im at a loss for ideas and another day idk what to do is one where i wish i knew how they feel about me."
I'm so scared and I'd love some advice,"I'm 13 (I turn 14 very soon though) and last year I had gotten signed up for this thing after my mum found my suicide note the day after I was planning on committing suicide. Two weeks ago my mum and I had to go to counselling which ended in them signing me up for something called CAMHS. This Wednesday I have to go again I'm so scared of whats going to happen. I don't want people to know why I was at the hospital or why I'm going again and since one of my closet friends is my cousin I'm afraid of her finding out and telling people. I'm scared incase I get treated differently, when I moved to that school I made a friend who was really nice but I started to realise she treats me like a kid, she says ""Okay?"" at the end of everything as if I won't understand and other stuff like that. I don't want anyone else to treat me like that. I also don't know whats going to happen in these visits nobody really tells me, I'm always scared incase they bring out medication or lock me in a room somewhere. I'm a very emotional and sensitive person, I'm always scared of something bad happening and it terrifies me every time my mum or literally anyone questions my mental health. I had a small panic attack when I got there and since I really don't know what is happening this time I'm scared of a big one happening.  


My school attendance is almost at 30% which is really really bad, I struggle to force myself up every morning to the point where it doesn't even happen I just lay there trying to convince myself its worth it. I really don't want to have to repeat a year, I don't know what I'll do if I have to.   


I'd appreciate advice on on the hospital thing and how to get myself up every morning, it'd help a lot.  


Thanks!"
I just need help,"I'm 14 and I'm always angry and I can't control it,after I'm done being angry I cry alot I'm just confused and don't know what to do anymore
I've been stressed alot and just can't handle it."
I’m reluctant to talk with my parents about personal matters,"Female in high school from asian family. I have complicated feelings towards my parents. The way they parent and speak to me I find really harsh. But I’m always so unsure of myself and I can’t distinguish wether it’s actually them or I’m actually stupid and they’re right. But that’s not the main problem I’m coming to reddit for.. I’ll give some background info first...

They would always say things along the lines of: “Are you even going to graduate?” “Why would you take an AP class it’s too hard for you” or stuff where I’m trying to have a normal conversation and they always turn it into how I need to just focus on school. I wish they’d trust me and realize that their choice of words is not encouraging, I find it rather insulting. This is something that I’ve brought up many times before but it’s like they hear me, but don’t listen to how hurt I feel. My mom in particular gets somewhat offended when I get sad or depressed. When I’m sad or depressed she gives me this disdainful look like “Really?“ And she tells me just to be happy and it’s all in my head. And somehow manages to make it about herself like “it’s always my fault” and “no matter what we do you’ll always be unhappy so what’s the point in trying anymore”

There was a particular moment in middle school in which my grades weren’t particularly good but they definitely weren’t close to failing. My mom came into my room at night while I was sleeping and was screaming at me and scolding me for having such bad grades. I was sobbing and kept telling her to get out and she wouldn’t for what was probably like 20 minutes but it felt like forever. Ever since then I’ve always locked my door and I refuse to let anyone into my room. That moment is always something that really messed with my head, until this day.

I was trying to express to my dad how depressed I was feeling and my mom came downstairs. I was crying and shaking and when I get like that I want to throw up. I didn’t want to talk to her because of the way she speaks to me. I brought up the time she came into my room just to express how stupid I’m being and she claims she doesn’t remember. I tell her it’s not something I would ever make up and she just interrupted me saying that she would never do something like that. That memory is so vividly engraved in my head and it’s honestly so frustrating.

Asking for advice on how to deal with this? I’m really struggling to figure out what to do about it."

Conversation tips and how to be more confident around your crush,Here are some tips https://youtu.be/Cr8vChPDy4w
Did I rush myself?,"So, I've dated this girl for like 4 months, you may say it's soon to say this, but I love her. The thing is, she said she felt the same, but never showed as much as me and sometimes I felt like I was the only one trying to make our relationship work. We had great moments together and sometimes I could see in her eyes she loved me.

We were going through a strange week, we didn't have much to talk about and at the end of that week she told me she was confused about us, that wasn't the first time she said that. I asked if it was a phase and what she wanted to do, she answered ""I don't know"" to both questions. I said I didn't want to be with someone that wasn't sure she wanted to be with me, she just apologize and we say goodbye. 

She tried to reach me two days later saying how much she missed me and how much she loves me, I was heartbroken and told her how much she hurt me, with all her confusion and everything else she did, like blowing me off and how she didn't seem to like me as much as I liked her. She apologized once again and said she wouldn't ""bother me anymore"". My last messages were:
-you don't bother me
-I wish we could solved this
-but I don't know how.

We haven't talked for a few days now. I miss her a lot, but she hurt me so much. Did I rush myself breaking up? Am I being too proud?
I can't stop thinking about her."
What next,"Hello everyone.

I have a very severe problem. You see, about 3 months ago me and my mom moved into a foreign country. Where I come from. Torrenting is legal for personal use... I did not know it was illegal here. I think you see where this is going. I torrented 2 movies and my mom and her boyfriend got a 900 euro fine. For one of the movies, they started to pay it off but it still caused problems as we have to pay it by 18.2 and that's only 2 weeks from now.
Yesterday I got another fine but before my parents could see it I hid it in my closet. Now they have to pay 1700 euro. By the 19.2

Im so fucking lost on what to do. I'm 13 and can't get a job yet because I don't know the language of the country I'm currently in well enough. 

I received the paper 1 day ago and the first paper 6 days ago. I'm scared shitless and lost on what to do. My parents come home in about 2 hrs

Please any advice"
I don’t know if I should transfer schools,"My school is... really... bad. They have told me multiple times they can’t support my mental health issues and the vice principal goes as far as to try to deny me of my accommodations. I was given the option to transfer to another school, with a program that would be good for me. They would be able to support me. But, there’s one issue. I would have to leave my friends that I have been with since elementary school. I broke the news that it might be happening to them last night, and they all seemed so sad. I felt so bad that I told them I’d make sure that I wouldn’t be transferred. I would still live in the same area, just not go to school with them anymore. I have friends at my new school, but I don’t know what to do. Ultimately, the decision is mine to make and it’s so much pressure. I want to stay with my friends, but maybe this new school could help me? And what if the new school doesn’t help? I’m just all alone without my best friends since elementary school?"
Was it wrong telling my friend that I like her boyfriend?,"Before I share this story, I just want to let you all know that my intentions were to never hurt my friend or make her mad. Anyway, last week I told my friend that I like her boyfriend but I made it perfectly clear that I would never make a move on him, flirt with him, or do anything to get in between them because I respect their relationship. I thought it wasn’t a big deal to tell her and I didn’t know that she was going to react the way she did. So it turns out that she got mad, and she hates me now and she even told people which makes me upset because I thought that would be something that would just be between her and I. And many people are making a huge deal about it and are mad at me which is freaking me out because I never met to hurt anyone. Now I feel like I bad person and I just want to hear your guy’s opinion on this and maybe make me feel better about this situation because I can’t stop thinking about it. Thank you!"
Idk what to do,"Im 13 if that makes a difference, and i have a crush on this girl. 2 of my friends say she also has a crush on me. I dont know what to do because my friends sometimes lie about stuff like that. Any advice?"
I’m not sure what to do,"I’m a male 15 and I have this friend from church. I had feelings for her since the 6th grade. I do somewhat have Christian morals. She’s been through a lot and she does drugs and she’s not a virgin. I’ve hated myself my whole life. Today was actually a really personal day. I spent the whole day with her usually me and her. She gave me my first kiss. Biggest problem is she wants to just be friends with benefits. She’s also bi, so that doesn’t help. I knew she was talking to some guy but I don’t think I deserve to get hurt like that. I did tell her that if she isn’t mine fully that I don’t even want to be around her because that shit’ll hurt me worse than how I am right now. I deeply care about her. If she gave me the chance I’m sure I could be there for her ways that no one else has. She doesn’t have the same feelings that I do ofc. I feel crazy when I think about her. Again she was my crush for 4 years and I never said a thing. Despite of all of those red flags I still love her. I just don’t want to be hurt. Right now I can’t stop thinking about her so I’m typing this at 3 AM"
how can you tell if someone likes you,"i have a really close friend that always joked about me and him dating and i would joke back and he told me many things like we’re going to be married and have kids and we’re going to end up together whether i think so or not and i always found it as like a joke but then he started talking to another girl and i realized how jealous i got because 1. she hates me and uses everything in her power to prevent him from seeing me and 2. i really did like him a lot and he was my closest friend and seeing him get dragged down by her is sad but i am confused very very confused about him because even though he’s with her he hangs out with me in secret and still talks like we’re going to be married and hookup and i’m like bud, you can’t be saying these things because your gf is NOT gonna be happy but he keeps doing it and i like it but i have to act like it’s bad because i don’t condone cheating and then i’m really trying to move on like it’s horribly painful being attached to him so i’m trying so hard to move on so i start talking to other guys and i’m talking to another guy(P) who is quite popular and we’ve been getting closer and closer and one day my old friend sees me and P and he pops up out of literally no where and says “where are y’all going” and P said “to have sex” because that is top tier comedy to teenage boys and my old friend, i’m gonna call him C, so he goes “oh ha ha yea ha ha” real awkwardly and i was like okkkkkkk P let’s go and we go to walk away and C goes woahhhhh bro i didn’t know you wore a chain and keeps talking to P cuz they’re like acquainted and we try to walk away again and he keeps pointing out random things like shoes and hoodies and just keeps talking so i’m like listen C we gotta go and we finally walk away and sit at a lunch table and C comes up again and starts talking to me who he “isn’t allowed to be seen with at school” and i’m like listen bud you’re gonna get in trouble with your girl and that’s that, well about a week later P goes silent like he ignores me won’t talk to me and it hurt and i thought i did something wrong but i find out from C’s friend that him and P hung out on the weekend and now P is just dead silent and i highly assume C talked trash about me so P would drop me and it’s so fucking annoying because i just want to move on, so again i start talking to another guy who is kinda friends with C, we are becoming friends it’s all good then C sees us together and bam this guy stops talking to me too and i’m just confused and thinking C is a jealous little bitch who can’t let me go but won’t be with me and then C’s best friend says i’m going to marry C and his gf (who i have class with) is threatened to hell by me because C “tells her things” and she “knows whats going on” which i got no idea what this girl means but i just need to get some backup that other people think he likes me too so i can confront him and not be absolutely and completely off the mark looking like a clown"

Property rights of a 18-year-old,"I have a boyfriend whose parents are overbearing and overly controlling. They deny him privacy and threaten to take his belongings away frequently. For context, they’re trying to prevent him from applying to college. He’s trying to move out but needs time. He loves his parents but needs to know what his actual rights are if he chooses to enforce them.


The items that were given to him as gifts are his property correct?   What about items given to him when he was still a minor that he retain possession of into adulthood.  Are those items still his property or the other property of his parents?

At what point is taking away someone’s personal property no longer in the realm of parenting and now is in the realm of criminal theft?

Additionally, he provides labor services to the household is this the basis of payment for tenancy. 
If he is a tenant, does he have the right to quiet enjoyment of his room without his landlord a.k.a. his parents interfering?

If his parents were to tell him to leave does he have rights to notice and due process through evection?"
I need some advice :(,"I’m on mobile so sorry about the format but I’ve been having some friend problems. So this girl and I, let’s call her F, and I were friends a few years ago but she moved away and moved back a year or 2 ago and we’ve been best friends ever since. Butttt just recently she’s been distant and she’s been getting closer with my cousin, which I consider one of my best friends because we’re the same age and have always been close. 

Anyways F has been getting closer to my cousin ever since before winter break. They even went to Mexico to visit some of my and cousins family and didn’t even invite me. They said it was because they were going deeper into Mexico and that required a passport (which I don’t have) and I understood but they didn’t go deeper into Mexico and it’s sus to me y’know. 

Previously, me, F, and my cousin were inseparable as a group but now I feel like they’ve left me out. Plus F has been talking a lot to our whole friend group before she talks to me. Like bro, you said we were best friends and even said that I was your favorite. Like fucking act like it y’know. Anyways I don’t know if it’s just me and they’ve been excluding me a great deal y’know. And I’m a very anxious person so Don’t have many friends and it sucks that one of the people that I considered one of my best best friends would just ditch me like that y’know. I woulf really appreciate it if I could get some advice on what to do/ tell me if I’m tweaking or not :("
I need advice on how to help a friend,"We're both f(15) in grade 10. For a while she's been smoking cigs (and even though I didn't bring it up much, I told her to not at do it too much at the very least). She just recently ran out and can't get any more since she was taking packs from her dad. She's now going through some withdrawal symptoms, and she's desperate for something else that'll calm her down in the same way. She has some other drugs at home that she uses quite regularly (some sleeping pills I believe), and when she runs out of those she turns to alcohol. I really don't know how to help her, since I don't go through the same thoughts. She also says that me and my friend don't really help much since we just reassure her that it's going to be ok. 

At this point I don't know how to help her anymore, even though I'm concerned about her physical and mental health. I've told her many times that we're here to help if at all possible, but I'm not sure what I can do anymore.

Does anyone have any ideas on what I can do to help? It really worries me that there's nothing I can do.

Sorry for any weird formatting if there is any, I don't know the difference between mobile and PC and this is also my first post"
I have a crush on a guy that apparently likes my friend and she likes him too. What should I do?,"
A little backstory:
They’re not dating. He has asked her out a couple times but My friend doesn’t want to date anyone right now, and not any time soon. 
I liked him before I know he liked her and that she liked him back, and I have since early November. I want to let him know how I feel but I’m afraid of embarrassing myself or having him gossip to his friends or my friend (the one he has a crush on) about it. My friend knows i like him as well."
I don’t know how to ask my girlfriend if I can kiss her,"So I’m a bisexual female and I’ve known my girlfriend (let’s call her Rachel) since we were in Nursery (that’s what we call preschool in Scotland) and me and her started dating a little over a week ago, I’ll start with how we got together. So I’m in a WhatsApp group chat with me, Rachel and our 2 other friends (I’ll call them Ellen and Jessi) and Ellen is also bisexual so I renamed the group chat as a joke to “Bisexuh0es” and then Rachel changed it to “Bisexuh0es and Jessi” and I said 

“wait? Rachel are you bi?” 

And she said

“Yeah I am”

And then I said without thinking

“Wow I used to have a crush on you but I thought you were straight” 

And she was like “I had a crush on you too” 

So then I messaged we privately after that and asked her to be my girlfriend and such etc etc. So this was on the 16/1/20 and we had a school trip on the 19th-23rd and we were sharing a room with our friends throughout the trip and we were hugging in the rooms and holding hands and such and yeah 😂☺️. I know that the relationship is moving quite fast but, it’s been fine that way so far and I kind of want to kiss her (that sounds so weird but) and I don’t know how to go about doing it I mean with Valentines Day coming up I might do it then but I’m just nervous on what to say. Can anyone help me with this?"
My 15yrold bestfriend had sex,so basically my best friend and I have been friends since we were in middle school. Recently she's been talking to this new guy and he has the same pattern as the last few exes she's had and he's just overall not that great. She really likes him and if she's happy I want to fully support her but I give her bits and pieces of my concern from time to time and I always remind her to be careful when she's with him. They've only known each other for a month and she just recently told me that she had sex with him. He's also in the 12th grade meaning he's almost 18 in just a few weeks. It wouldn't be that big of a deal and we were older and if this weren't her first time doing this. I don't know what to do to get her to understand my concern for her well-being and safety I honestly I'm just right for her and I need someone to please tell me how to handle this because I have absolutely no fucking idea what to do.
please help,"i’m from england and i’m going to college or sixth form in September this year, i’m really stressed about my GCSEs and even more stressed about what i’m going to do after i finish secondary school.
i’ve applied to four places so far (because many places have passed their application deadline). i’ve lost a lot of hope and happiness for my future because my dad and my friends tell me that i can’t go anywhere with art.
i’ve chosen art because i’m debatable good at it but i kinda don’t want to do it, but everything seems so difficult, i’ve applied for BTECs in 3 different colleges and only A levels in the one connecting to my school. 
i’ve also applied for a BTEC for criminology because i find interest in becoming a social worker or even a police officer, my parents dislike that more because they feel like those careers would put me at risk and i feel like i can’t do anything without judgement. 
i’m also extremely stressed about meeting new people, i have chosen colleges that are extremely far from my secondary school (in the other direction but close to my house) and none of my friends are going to any of them. i’m afraid that i won’t have any friends when i go and that i’ll lose contact with the ones i have already. i am slightly afraid of people and basically everything, i just feel like my mental health is going to get worse next year because i feel like i’m going to regret my decisions."
"I have a group project in a class with someone who doesn’t speak English, only Spanish. How can I make him part of the group and be involved without being able to talk to him?",We are making a video for the project and I’m not sure how I can involve him.
Booty,That’s a girl in my class with a HUGE ass but im ugly as fuck. Should I let her catch me staring?
I think I may have a crush?,"Olay so I'm trying to move on from my ex and I think I may like someone? The thing is, I'm not sure if I actually like him, or if I'm just interested in him to try and rebound and move on from my ex. I'm supposed to see him tomorrow and I'm just unsure. Hes kinda a fuckboy and honestly hes not that cute. I'm just conflicted. Idk what to do or how to figure it out."
So I like one of my closest friends,"I’ve known this one guy for 3 years and he’s become one of my best friends. I like this guy a lot and apparently he likes me too but doesn’t want to ruin our friendship if anything goes wrong. I honestly don’t know what to do...
So if anyone has any advice on what I should do that would be pretty awesome."
My online friend says she's going to kill herself. What do I do?,"She lives in another country and I don't know where she lives, so I don't think I can call the police. What else could I do to help her?"
I don’t know how to get out of a 3 year toxic friendship,"So I’ve had this insanely toxic friend for about 2-3 years and I have no idea how to get out of this friendship. For safety reasons, we’ll just call her Ella. When I first became friends with Ella she was this super sweet, funny and witty girl whom I just really liked. But as I spent more time with her I started noticing how she’d get annoyed whenever I was hang out with other people. She’d make it obvious that she was angry at us whenever we hung out with someone else or whenever I hung out with the other girl in our friend group (let’s call her Anne) and the next day Ella would act mad at us. It’s like everytime I make a a new friend she find something she can pick at so I’ll stop being friends with that person. Ella always talks about how she’s the ‘most disliked person of the friend group’ when Anne and I really do everything we can to please her and keep her happy. Ella talks so openly about how much she hated me and how dumb she thought I was and how boring I am and acts like it’s all funny. I auditioned to go to my dream school and told her how excited I was, the only thing she could talk about is how if I got in I would be leaving her a few months before she moved and how I was ‘abandoning’ her for some other school. She was so happy when she heard I didn’t get in the school. Ella would point out things she hated that people did and then state how I did it. I tried to leave the friendship once and just hung out with other people for a day while she was giving me death stares and she started crying so the counsellor had to get involved and I had to lie about why I was hanging out with other people and say I was just hanging out with other people rather than I was trying to get out of this toxic friendship. She brings that up all the time and talks about how she’ll never forgive me for that when she’s hurt me so many more times and I just pretend it never happened and that I’m completely fine. Every fight we’ve had she’s started, every fight is always about how she’s dissatisfied with me and I always apologise for it and tell her I won’t hang out with that person again and I’ll make sure to not sit or hang out with other people at lunch. Ever since I’ve been friends with her every time I hang out with someone else (despite asking her if she wants to come along to) we have a fight every time from her thinking I prefer them over her. I only sit with her and Anne at lunch now. It’s mentally draining being friends with her and being her ‘therapist’, having be there for her 24/7 and having to listen to her talk bad about me to my face and apologising to her. Every time we hang outside of school I’m always upset. My family is so tired for me and just wants me to leave the friendship. They’ve tried telling me what I can do but nothing really works, I can’t speak to them about her anymore because they just don’t want to hear about her. And it’s so confusing because she can be so sweet and funny and happy and I think about how I could ever want to leave this friendship but then the next day she just starts a fight with me for no reason. I want to go to the school counsellor but I’m scared the counsellor’s gonna confront Ella about it and Ella’s gonna spread lies and make everyone hate me. So for right now, I’m just waiting till she leaves this school. She’s leaving in about 4-5 months. Her family tells me they’re gonna make sure to keep in contact and have me visit them whenever I get the chance to. I don’t know what to do anymore. Please help me"
TLDR: My mom is a conspiracy theorist and wants to kick me out because I prefer science. (I’m 17 and she’s 55) Any advice on how to handle this?,"My mom is the kind of woman who worships conspiracy theories like an obsession my friends had when we were all in the Creepypasta fandom; she believes everything is real. Here are a few things she believes. I want to stress that I don’t believe in any of this, I’m LGBT and I love studying science.  I believe that there could be other life out there, but I believe more in evolution and other sciences because of the amount of proof.
- aliens are helping to stop global warming 
- global warming doesn’t technically exist
- you shouldn’t punch nazis, even if they are nazis.
- all the royals and all billionaires are lizards and pedophiles.
- some kind of aliens wrote the bible to enslave humanity
- humans were all slaves
- evolution doesn’t exist.
- black lives matter shouldn’t be a thing 
- extreme weather is caused by aliens
- aliens literally control everything 
- all politicians but trump are pedophiles
- Trump is a good person 
-vaccines cause autism
- vaccines are killing people
- Trans people aren’t supported by science
- Tran women are men who need masculinity 

Anyways so I had a talk about a recent protest in having about the RCMP in my area dropping rape cases, and she immediately said that the royals that are moving to Canada are pedophiles and they are living with a pedophile.  That’s not what we were talking about, and I tried to steer back to the original topic, but she stayed on hers. She then brought up how climate change isn’t real, and since I’m learning about it in school, I showed her my notes and the scientific documents and proof I had from my lessons. She said human science is wrong, I called her crazy, and now she wants me to move out. She threatens me like this a lot, and it never actually happens, but I really want out.
I can’t trust anyone who lives near me enough to house me, and I go to college in September. Until then, I have no way out, and what’s worse is I started to believe what she was telling me until recently. I just hope I can make it until then,  because I really need to cut her off from my life.

Any advice on how to handle this?"
Sex and fingering...,"I read an article about how girls when they’re riding you grind going forward and backwards and don’t bounce going up and down, it made me wonder when I’m having sex with a girl obviously I go in and out but would going side to side do anything or If I’m fingering a girl would going side to side or up and down do anything rather than in and out? I’m just curious."
Can’t talk to people.,"I can’t talk to people. What do I do?!

It’s a dumb question I know but I want to know. All my life I have been in one school and made friends there. Like childhood friends. Then I decided to go to another school for two years.  It’s about to come to an end now and I’ve made good friends. Like a group. But I can’t talk To anybody outside this group. I mean when someone tries to talk to me I can’t seem to keep up a conversation. I just end up saying something that’s perfect to end a conversation and I really want to be social. I want to have a close friendship. Even with my childhood friends I feel like a third wheel. Like they’re talking about something that I know nothing about and I just smile awkwardly to seem okay. Why am I not able to talk to people in general? I have this perfect conversation in my head and either it goes nothing like it or it never happens cause I couldn’t make a move. I mean I’m probably going abroad for studies in 6 months or so and I keep on believing that I’ll be a social butterfly there. I won’t. How could I when I can’t get myself to talk to people in my own country! Well thanks for reading."
what should i say if my parents ask about my bruises?,"i went out to the beach today with two of my guy friend and girl friends. we got a bit carried away and were play fighting most of the day, which resulted in me getting a lot of bruises (from the boys). they didn’t intend on hurting me and i don’t find it wrong in any way, but if my parents ask about the bruises i don’t know what to say. they’re very noticeable and i have quite a lot of them. if i tell them that the boys gave them to me, they’ll find it suspicious and will be cautious about me hanging out with them. does anyone have any cover up stories i could use or advice?"
How to not get your locker broken into,"Yo bruh I’m somewhat of a pick pocket and I can’t even begin to tell you how many fucking people in my school have a 3 digit combination lock and the combination is 000.
I’ve opened so many fucking lockers this way,  
If you’re buying a 3 digit lock and you don’t change the code to something that isn’t 000 know that any guy with a little bit of knowledge of locks and a tiny bit of greed is gonna boost all of your shit and you’re basically asking him to do it."
How can I meet with a boy from my school who is 2-3 years younger?,"I'm 15yo boy, last time I'm extremely obsessed with one boy from my school. I constantly see him at school and I can't stop starring at him. He's extremely cute for me and I even wanna have a quite relations, and I wanna hug him when he would don't mind it
He's always along with his friends and classmates, so I dunno how would they react if I come up to him with my purpose to meet him cuz I don't even know his name. What should I do to not seems like a jackass when I come up? And when and where I should come up? I live in Kazakhstan and there are lot of folks which have a really miserable attitude to gays/bisexuals
So I'm scared of that
(and sorry for my English maybe I did a few mistakes though)"
Seeking advice about friends,"So there’s this guy that I’ve known for about two years. We’re in a group of friends, but the others more or less bully him from time to time. I want to speak up against the others, but it’s hard, as I‘be known one of them for 6+ years.

I also want to talk and make the first guy feel better, but there’s a problem: he’s super annoying. All the time he just goes on and on about a game or something that I haven’t heard of and absolutely don’t care about. He’s also very clingy and just not fun to be around. He has also done some weird things which I won’t go into detail on here, but let’s just say that there’s a reason the others are sometimes mean to him.

So, I want to “break up”  our friendship, as I just don’t have the energy to deal with him and manage school. But I feel bad, as I know he has multiple mental disabilities, few other friends and have had a hard time throughout his childhood.

Anyone who knows what I can do?"
"Help, please.","I’m gonna get personal for a second I’m 16 years old and I’m being sexually assaulted by my step dad, I’m not sure if my mom doesn’t believe me or if she’s part of it but she says I’m making it all up. I’ve called the police, cps, I’ve gone to several police stations and the most they do is say they’re going to investigate but I never hear back from them. Weird question but is there any advice as to what I can do to drive him crazy and out of the apartment? I’ve tried locking him out,  flattening his tires and leaking his debit card info. I’m not afraid to hurt him a little bit but I don’t want to murder anyone. I just want him away from me and my brother."
I NEED GUY ADVICE!!!,I need advice on guys. Recently I went to Canada to go and visit family friends with my mom and my brother. There are three guys and they have always acted like cousins to us. One guy who is 19 has always been close to me I’m 15. During winter break me and him were watching Netflix in a twin bed and he put his arm around me. After he put his arm around me and my mom walked into the room and yelled at us on how this is not lady like on my behalf. She left the room and later I pause the movie because of the awkward tension between us. My mom pulled him aside without me knowing and asked him if he liked me. He said he didn’t know his feelings towards me in that way. The next day at night he asked my brother if he wanted to watch TV. My brother said no because he was tired so when the 19-year-old walked past me I suggested we could watch Netflix. Earlier that day it was his birthday and he got a new phone. So I said I could help him set it up before we watch Netflix. I sat on his bed waiting for him to get changed into comfy clothes in the bathroom. After a while everyone in the house fell sleep and I asked him if we were still going to watch Netflix. He said yes and put on a new movie for us to watch. We watched the hunger games. His arm was uncomfortable so I suggested he put his arm around me. He sat there for a while and I told him I wanted snacks. I told him to come with me because I had to walk all the way downstairs and it was dark. After we got snacks we went upstairs and he sat on the inside of the bed closest to the wall and he got mad because he’s bigger than me. I told him that I should lay on the outside because I was gonna go to bed soon. When he went to lay on the inside of the bed he put his arm on the pillow. So when I would lay down his arm would be behind me. He put his arm around me without asking me. After 10 minutes he slid his arm down my waist and kept it there. I put my head on his chest and we watched the movie for an hour. I got tired and suggested that I should go to bed. He told me that I should stay longer because we were both comfortable. I told him I had to go to bed because I was tired and we were gonna wake up early the next day to hang out with family. When I went back to my room I did not know what just happened. The next night he asked me if I wanted to watch Netflix. At this point I do not know if he likes me or not because I didn’t think anyone would act this way towards someone they don’t like. He had his arm around my waist. We were comfortable with each other. Expected that I was most likely going to go to bed and he wouldn’t argue for me to stay longer. I went to bed at 3 AM and we both had to wake up at 8 AM to go skiing. While we were skiing I fell down and he picked me up. To make sure I wouldn’t fall down again he put his arm around my waist. He asked me if I wanted to do it an all nighter. He later fell asleep because he was tired from skiing all day. I woke him up and asked if he still wanted to watch Netflix and he said yes. He later fell asleep. The next day I told him why didn’t he stay awake so we can watch Netflix because it was my last night there. He said I was supposed to wake him up again and got mad at me. The day we went skiing was my last day in Canada and I was leaving the next day so it was our last chance to cuddle and watch Netflix. I like him and I don’t know if he likes me back I’m scared to tell him how I feel if he doesn’t like me back. Do you guys think he likes me or not?
I can’t stop thinking about my best friend after what happened,"So I’ll add a little bit of background info for this one, last night (when I’m writing this) I was at my best friends house for a sleepover, 2 of our other best friends were there aswell, I’ll change their names up for this story, so there’s me, Danielle (that’s my real name btw haha) I’m bisexual, there’s Heather, Skoliosexual (possibly pansexual she’s still figuring stuff out) then there’s Melanie and Katelyn they aren’t interested in dating and find it disgusting (I’ve asked if they’re asexual but they claim they aren’t) anyway we had a sleepover last night at Heathers house and me and Heather we have quite a lot in common and she was one of the people who I told first after me and my first girlfriend got together and broke up so me and her are really close. We have this inside joke that we’re married to each other (weird I know 😂😅) and at this sleepover we were kinda like flirting a little but then we were hugging and in the background Melanie and Katelyn were playing some kinda cheesy love songs in my opinion haha, and me and Heather were lying down on the mattress while like hugging up with each other and then I thought about and lesbian mini movie I saw on YouTube were something kinda similar to this happened and I pointed it out, and then Katelyn brung up something that happened at a sleepover about 7-8 months ago (I’ve known Katelyn since the beginning of primary school) where I kissed another girl and sung ‘I kissed a girl’ after it as a joke (I hadn’t come out of the closet yet so the girl I kissed didn’t know I was bisexual, to be fair I kinda thought I was straight at the time) and then Melanie told Heather “I think you should kiss Danielle” and put on ‘I kissed a girl’ and then Heather said she had cherry chapstick as a joke and then she put it on, then it was at the first “I kissed a girl and I liked it” and me and Heather kissed, but since I was nervous I came in too aggressively she told me to do it again and then we ended up doing it again and again til the song was over . But it was moving so so quickly like I was on top of Heather, she was on top of me it was, amazing. So amazing we ended up doing it with the song on all over again. It was one of the best parts of the night haha (I’m such a horny spaz..) but after I was red as a tomato, Melanie was crying, Katelyn and Melanie were pretty grossed out (they’re not homophobic just grossed out by dating in general) and then Melanie was like “I didn’t think you’d actually do it!” And then it kinda all came to me
“I think I like Heather” 
but then later Katelyn told me that Heather said she wasn’t into it (I highly think she was because after it she pinned me down on the bed 😅😂) and my heads been messed up all day because of it, like I don’t know if I should ask out Heather, if I should just try not to think of it but, it’s been really hard 
What should I do?

EDIT: So I asked Heather a little while ago how she felt when we kissed and she wasn’t into it 😅:( but I’m over it now, I got a new girlfriend a little over a week ago and Heathers still one of my best friends so it’s all worked out well 😊"
Help regarding my girlfriend,"In my last post I talked about how I needed help with my girlfriend and stuff I can’t really remember so maybe read that one.

Now I’m kinda scared to break up with her (both 13f) because I asked her over Instagram what would happen if we broke up and she freaked out and said that we *would* be friends but it’d take time for her (which is obviously ok and normal). But then the next day I was hanging with a mutual friend and she texted me saying she was really stressed and freaking tf out. I sent a meme of Michael Myers which made me and my friend laugh and I said that Myers was my true love and she was my side hoe as a joke and she said she’d just not reply so I said sorry.

So we said sorry and stuff and she texted “I love you” and I looked to my friend (I told her I was thinking about breaking up) and I just know it’s not right and I feel horrible for saying “I love you too” back. She started texting me a lot saying that I was amazing and she loves me so much and I feel so so guilty and I don’t know how to break up with her. I have no idea what to do cause I know it’ll fully shatter her to fucking pieces if we break up.

She kept sending hearts and calling me amazing and I have to say it back and stuff so she doesn’t feel bad (she ALWAYS uses the “🥺💖” emojis and I just fucking can’t break up with her now I’m feeling manipulated? I don’t know how to do anything right now.

Please help me"
Should I leave my loser friend group to pursue my own ambition?,Right now I'm at a crossroads. I'm still a teenager and it's the second semester of my sophomore year. I have a solid group of friends I can laugh with and enjoy. I love them to death but we are all losers. By this I simply mean that when people look at us in a group they know not to hang out with us since we are weird. My best friend decided to distance himself from our group a while back and none of us understood why he would do that just to try to get girls and be popular. He was the best looking out of us and now that he distanced himself he had girls craving for him and now he has a girlfriend and is happy. Since highschool is going by fast I'm starting to realize that I want what he has and I see the problem. However I don't know if I should distance myself from them just to change who I am. I want to keep close bonds with my friends but if I do distance myself they won't like me as much. So any advice because I do want to change likey best friend did before I regret it or something after highschool is over.
how do i start talking to him again ?,"i was very close to this guy friend-wise, until we started talking a lot more. we have many classes together and after talking with him in my classes, i realized that i had a crush. he then told me that he was going to ask me to homecoming but couldn’t because of something that came up. he told me maybe next time and i said i would hold him to it. that day forward, we stopped talking and it’s been very awkward because i see him all the time. i want to start talking again and be able to start getting closer so we could go to the next dance together, but i keep overthinking that i’m doing something wrong. i don’t know what to do :( we’re both very shy and i’ve tried to reach out after we stopped talking but he doesn’t try to interact anymore. he keeps looking at me in class, but we never speak to each other. what do i do ?"
"Thinking about leaving home, need advice on how to do it.","Hi reddit! This is my first post, so I hope the formatting is ok, but here's my story


I'm the oldest of six (F17, almost 18) and the things that have happened in my house recently are pushing me towards leaving.


This started back in early 2018 when my parents took my phone and found out that I'm bi. They took my phone away for a year, screamed at me for hours, set content blocks and DSNs, and then said nothing about it for about two years.


Finally got my phone back just over a year ago and they still try to check/take it regularly, but I've been refusing to let them have it, and it's worked well, but I have just short of a panic attack every time mom asks.


Flash forward to the day before New years, a few days ago at the time that I'm writing this. My mom yelled at me for turning off my phone every time she walks in the room (a coping mechanism that I learned after the last time they took it away), told me that she refuses to pay for a phone plan (the only reason I have one is for driving because I have a poor sense of direction, and so I can call for help if I get stuck somewhere, and I have been trying to use it to get a job, to pay for said plan, car insurance, save up for college {something I don't want, but they do}, and move out). And told me that I was a sinner and evil and going to hell because she thought I was dating a ""girl"" (one of my non binary friends).


So I've about had it and I want to leave, but I don't know what to do or how to pull it off without ending up dead or something. I have a plan to try and leave on the 21 of Jan, but if things get worse sooner, I might have to speed it up.

What do I do?

EDIT: As of today, Jan 5th, I have decided that I will leave and I'm going to do it next week. I'm going to try living with my friend that I mentioned earlier. Thank you all for your kind words, it really means a lot to me!"
Got problem with how i look,"I’m a guy so this is kind of weird to say, but I feel really ugly, I have very light acne, skinny and I feel like my head shape is weird... anyone gone through something similar?"
The Girl Of My Dreams Doesn't Like Me,"I've been best friends with this girl for about 3 years. She is my absolute everything and I care almost too much about her. I recently asked her out and she rejected me. I've never felt more pain then knowing I just got rejected by who I beleive is the person who was made for me. The worst part is when I felt like maybe I wasnt  boyfriend material, and she proceeded to say ""you're way more than boyfriend material"". The fact that she told me I was more than boyfriend material and yet still broke my heart is driving me mad. This is not the first time this has happened, and I'm seriously considering suicide at this point. I just want a release."
I need help with life,I’m a high school freshman and I need help. I don’t want to come off as being whiny but I’m having struggles with school and family. At school I’m commonly referred or grouped with the edgy or emo kids. I don’t want to be in this group of people. I like the color black and I guess that is a problem for most others not sure why. I have a crush on this girl but I know she doesn’t like me back. The only times she has acknowledged me is just to say hi because she has to be my partner. The problem with my home life is that I was expected to even as little kid to be the saving grace of my family. I was supposed to be the smart one and pass all of school work with flying colors. My dad and mom are divorced and constantly trying to dish out dirt on each other. Another problem is that I have a very big anger problem it’s not uncontrollable it’s just that if I get mad enough I’ll start yelling and crying and punch shit until I calm down. My family thinks poorly of me because of it and my mother has told that one day when they were talking (my parents) my dad said that he was worried I was going to be a school shooter. I cried over that because I thought I knew my dad but I know he said that for a damn fact even if it was from my mom. I depresses me thinking about the different possibilities as to why people don’t like me or acknowledge me. My brother also hated my guts when we were kids and would constantly bully me and try to make me look bad in front of everyone that we knew. These things have gotten to me so much that the main reason I think people even try to be nice to me is because they think I’m going to shoot up the school and they don’t to be target caught in the crosshairs. Thank you if you read till the end I really need some help if you have anything that could help please let me know.
I feel trapped by my mom,"I feel trapped under my mother. I'm almost 19 and about to graduate high school and go to college. Shes never let me have a job and shes trying to force me to not get one in college. I want to go to Italy for college and shes trying to force me to go to university of texas at austin and move there with me. My mom has always made snide comments to me about how I live and how I'm not doing enough at school. If I try to call her out for these comments she either denies it or says I'm exaggerating or taking it out of context. 
It feels like my mom is trying to control my life.

Also, I have a college fund that my grandpa set up for me and after he died my name and my moms name was put on it. I'm really afraid that if I go against my mom and do what I want then she will use that against me. 
I dont know if I'm overexaggerating or just misunderstanding her."
Does anyone else here cut themselves just to feel like something.,"I cut myself just to feel something, if I dont I am completely emotionally empty and I just dont know what else to do. This is the only part of my life I feel u can control. I just dont know if I'm alone in this. If you have any advice that could help me it would be appreciated."
I can't decide..,"Ive been dating someone for nearly 3 years now with occasional breakups. During one of them I dated a girl named Rose and she was amazing but... after a while my old gf came back and was crying wanting me back so I left Rose. I recently started talking to her again and I can feel that she still likes me and I want to go for it but... she lives across the country and my current gf threatens suicide so I just cant decide anymore. Rose is the most amazing girl ive ever met and I can talk to her for hours but my current gf Ive just lost interest but I cant leave because everyone in my school would hate me, i would risk causing suicide... im just stuck okay? Sorry for the rantyness I just really need advice. Thanks in advance.

Edit: i understand I should break up with my gf but i dont know how because theyre one of my best friends. I cant hurt them.

Edit #2: I know that it might not have been a good decision to go to Rose immediately but it felt.. right. I couldnt be more glad I did what I did because Rose is just the best person ive ever met. I guess ive just learned from this that you need to just let go sometimes. Something you all should know is well, wait for that someone special. Dont use dating apps, dont look for a partner; make friends and if one of them makes you feel special then ask them, just go for it."
"Advice for a good ""cleanup""","I (a gay, very horny 14m) have been doing a lot of ""hand in the pants"" when I'm home alone. I usually use a top cover as cleanup because I don't use it, but now that I'm staring at all of the stains from my ""drool"" I really need good advice on what to do to get rid of them or my father might catch onto something. Do you guys have a solution?"
How can I (18M) approach girls?,"I live on a college campus and I'm in my sophomore year. I see girls all the time in my class and I go to the female dormitory from 5:30 pm to 8:00 pm in order to keep a female friend of mine company at the secretary's desk. Besides the typical greeting with girls leaving in and out of the dorm while I'm there and the interaction with my friend, I have no idea  on how to approach girls or how to talk to them. Any advice to help me would be greatly appreciated."
23m and a 16F?,"Not me but my friend is 16years old and a junior in high school.  This guy is 23, a sophomore in college and is about to start at our high school; not teaching but he will have contact with students.  At first they were just “talking” but now I know they’re having sex. I want to do something, because I feel as though he’s preying on her but should I even get in the middle of it? She’s ok with it but he has a tendency to go after younger girls and with him coming to my school I don’t want him to prey on other young girls...WWYD"
Idk,"I don’t know how to live life I guess. I’m really quiet at school. I guess I have a loss of identity. I’ve been called so many fucked up things. I hated school since 3rd grade I’m a sophomore now. I’m not even going to school rn. I’ll start back next semester. I have a lot of self hate, but I know I’m a good person. I got admitted to the psychiatric hospital 2 months ago and haven’t been to school since. I don’t know how to feel better I deal with depression and anxiety. Sometimes I feel like I can’t socialize that it’s almost hate, I think that’s my depression. I sometimes get anxious if I’m quiet too long but I guess it’s kinda lonely. Part of me believes your happiness shouldn’t depend on others. Everyone kinda seems fake to me. I have trust issues because the friends I did have were shitty and made me feel bad. I can’t take criticism. I’d be alone at lunch and have no idea wtf to do. I had honors classes and ap but I thought it was stupid I had no friends. Last year I couldn’t talk to some ppl but so was still social but I had shitty friends again and my 2nd group disappeared one by one. I’m like an outcast I don’t fit in with the nerdy kids yet I’m not popular. I’m a good person if you treat me well. Also I get along with others. I am a little chubby but I’ve been going to the gym almost every day. I guess I hate myself too much to ever date. I lack confidence unless I’m only with one pers I hold up well. I guess I hate crowds. High school school sucks imo.  I feel like I just don’t fit in. I was a really happy kid until ppl made me feel bad about myself. Hurt people hurt people. I don’t know how to build my self esteem"
Parents bought personal lubricant and when I asked what it was they refused to tell me,"So a package came into the mail and I assumed it was my father’s books or something (it was a heavy package) so I opened it up.  I asked my dad about it when I saw it was lubricant but he told me to just forget it and not tell my mom.  

Originally I thought the lubricant was like for my dad’s car since he like to work on his cars until I read the directions. I always viewed my parents as sort of very conservative but I guess I’m wrong about that.  

What can lubricant be used for?"

I need to win a war...,"So, my friend and I are having a “lol war” we are basically trying to “get the last lol” meaning telling/texting/writing/other ways to make someone look at or hear lol, each other until the other caves and gets tired of “fighting”.

I might be pregnant,"I was in a mental hospital recently, and I remember one or two nights where they gave me double dose of my already extremely high dosage of sleep meds.

And I've had this reoccurring dream, where I'm being... touched. I'd never had a dream like that before, and it felt... wrong.

And now, I've been feeling weird, nauseous, I haven't gotten my period, and my pants are starting to get to small.

I'm only 13, I don't even know if I am pregnant, I wouldn't know how to approach my parents with this because I'm a lesbian, and I'm out to them, so what would I even say?

I just need a serious conversation about your opinions, and advice"
Hijab: what should I do,"Hello I am I hijabs(10 years) the reason for why I started to wear it was because I just liked it I thought it was pretty. A lot of people think I am religious but I am not I don’t pray and I don’t really follow most of the rules. I am not one of the hijab is that takes it off and on I just keep it on all of the time. And my problem is that the hijab for me was something that I was proud of that I loved and I used to feel like it didn’t restrict me, but know I still love wearing it. I am just sick of having to restrict my self from dressing the way I wanna dress, cause I have a berry curvy body so when i just wanna wear a top and jeans it looks to provocative. Another thing is that I would like to go to clubs and party(not drink) just party without people judging me. I used to feel free in my hijab but now I just feel like I am suffocating. And my parents don’t care if I take it off or not it just that I have been wearing it for so long that it’s so hard to stop and I am so scared that some people will look at me and see a failure. And a part of me wanna keep it on but another part of me don’t want to. I don’t really feel like I can’t be myself, I have felt like this in 4 years just hoping it will go away. I just don’t know what i should do please don’t judge me."
I failed ☹️,"I should be graduating this December, but one of my professor give me a failing grade even it is my 2nd take to his subject. I feel so devastated. There are so many people who are so very disappointed with me and I can't do anything with it. I did my best but my best wasn't enough. Now I don't know how to deal with my financial issue. I feel so worthless and useless. I don't know what to do. ☹️"
How do I ask my mother this sketchy question?,"So I obviously need some advice. The advice I need is on how to bring up a question, and ask said question.

I need help on how to bring up and ask the question of, can my best female friend and I fly to a different state that's a while away alone (without an adult) to meet an online friend of mine. I know this sounds pretty sketchy but for some background I will include the following paragraph.

I met him online playing video games. We ended up talking and what not. We've been talking for a couple months now. I think of him as my bestest friend, someone closer then all of my other friends. We both really want to meet each other. He's a minor like myself and our age difference is very small. I know for a fact that he is a minor, not some older man pretending to be a teenager. The reason we haven't meet up is because of the large distance between us.

So that's the background. I already accounted for the cost of plane tickets, baggage, someone to go with, and a public place to meet. I will be paying for the whole trip for myself and my friend so my mother won't have to spend a penny on it. We're only going over for a day, and we (my friend and I) will be missing one or two days of school. We would go late one night so we'd get there in the morning then leave that day. We will be meeting at a very public place with tons of people. He might be bringing male friends as well. 

Just for the record because I feel like this will go along with what my mother will say, I am a responsible person. I act mature, never get in trouble, get good grades, ect. So if that helps any it's there. 

Also an extra question that I haven't quite thought out. My friend and I are legally allowed to fly alone but need a guardians signature. How would I do that on a round trip?

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you."
am i overly sensitive?,"it was my birthday recently and my friends and i regularly use snapchat as our form of communication 

if you understand how snapchat works you’d know you have the option to post on your stories with other ppl viewing it and normally, when it was someone’s birthday my friends and i will post the person on our stories wishing them a hbd but when my birthday came along none of my friends did so.. :( but i continued to do it for them 

am i just being over dramatic? and overly sensitive? or do i have a right to somewhat sad and hurt?"
I need advice ig lol,"so I can’t tell if I just have high adrenaline or I’m actually just sad but I haven’t been myself lately. I’m very responsible I do my homework, and I have lots of friends, but I don’t feel like I’m having the high school experience. I haven’t got to Interact with many males my age except old grade school friends because I go to an all girls school. I go to that school because of it’s academics and I don’t want to move. I honestly don’t want to wait till I’m 18 or 19 to go to a party, or enjoy myself. But I feel as if all of my friends don’t do those type of things, and I don’t have anyone to do them with. I also enjoy hanging out with friends and doing different things. But my friends always say they can’t every time I’m available, and I always can’t every time their available. I’m not introverted or extroverted I just try not to get to close to people who seem to get a bad rep but I’m friendly no matter what. I also suck at starting conversations cause I can be awkward and quieter at first (even though I said I wasn’t that introverted). I don’t have a clear idea of what I’m asking. I just want to enjoy high school and do “high school” things whilst still being able to work hard for my grades. I also want to make more friends and ones that are open to going places even though I still like my friends I have now."
Why is everyone in HS so insecure?,"I can sense it on most students. Whether it's by trying to act tough, cool, or whatever facade you try to put on. I can see right through all that. Deep down everyone is afraid.  Is the pressure to fit in just too much?"
A guy burped on me,In school yesterday a guy in my class burped on me when we were entering the classroom. I found it quite schocking because we don’t know eachother very well but he really came up to me and just burped close to face. I didn’t know how to react so I just laughed. Today a day after the incident after thinking about it is really weird. What does it mean? What was he trying to do? Am I supposed to burp back?
Am I wrong?,"So I work at a restaurant, tonight I was scheduled to get off at ten, but the manager who was suppose to close called in like he always does. 


I was suppose to leave on a trip with my family after I got off work. They scheduled the trip around the time I got off so I wouldn’t get left behind. 


So I called the Gm in a panic because it wasn’t my day to close and no one let me know ahead of time to ask if it was going to be OK with me. I felt bad for my family because they specifically planned the trip around my time. 


After I called the GM he told me that the reason he called in was because the closing manager’s grandma is in the hospital having surgery. 


The manager who was suppose to close had a family emergency so they resorted to me closing because I was already there.


In the end, they got the other guy to come in and finish the shift, like he was suppose to do. He was upset at me for not closing for him. 


But we each have our own individual lives. No one asked me if I had anything going on to see if I was okay with closing. So now I’m on my way to the visit my family up north. 


Should I feel bad for not closing for the manager?"
how do you get over a boy that doesn’t like you back?,"the first time i met him my friend called dibs and told me she wanted him so i backed off and let her have her shot. i got really close with him and we were great friends, hanging out every minute we could. i stupidly caught feelings when i knew my friend wanted him so once again i didn’t act on anything even when he kept giving me signals. i fell in love with him and we would cuddle and makeout sometimes which didn’t help me. he always said he was going to be there for me for anytime i needed him and told me several times he was going to marry me one day and then one day it just stopped. he stopped talking to me stopped hanging out with me. i went from seeing him every day and every night to never because he found a girl he wanted to fuck. he was one of my only friends and i don’t know how to get over him and i’d really like to."
How to avoid telling people I went to rehab,"(Not for drugs, im 15f and I have a condition that made it hard to walk and that's a different story)
 
So I'm going into 10th grade and I missed sectionals for band camp (2 days a week to start practicing for football games)  because I was in rehab idk what to tell people where I've been because I don't want to be an 'attention whore'. :( 
I'm doing a lot better now and it's something that you wouldn't know most days if you just looked at me. I don't want to be dishonest either but I don't know what else to do."
I regret something awful that I did,"Ok so someone recently posted something on r/teenagers about their sister ruining their minecraft world. They asked for advice and how to forgive her and avoid killing her. I, being the impulsive teen that I am, commented something along the lines of “Don’t forgive her, just kill her.” 
I know realize how bad that sounds, but I thought it was a funny joke and I didn’t think of it as a threat at the time. The user came out with a statement later about how they had gotten so many death threats from people about their sister. 
I feel so bad about what I wrote. I didn’t think it was a big deal at the time, and I commented an apology for saying that but I feel like it wasn’t enough. Is there anything else I can do to make up for it? Or should I just delete my comment and leave it alone?"
He won’t leave me alone and i’m scared,"hello !! i’m very very new to reddit ( today ) so idk if i’m doing this right, but i just needed a place to ask for advice about something i can’t talk about irl 

so basically this guy i met from a summer camp will NOT leave me alone.  He’s 6’4 and prolly 300 pounds, i am NOT 6’4 and 300 pounds. He sends me constant unwanted pics and tries to make me send them in return. saying things like “ i’ll give u a deal, u either send me 5 pics and we don’t hook up when we see each other or u send me one and we do” or “i know u want to, just let me take care of u”.  i would block him but he has shown up to my house before without me telling him my address so i know he can find me. we also have mutual friends and i don’t want them to find out about all this. i’ve told him i’m not interested multiple times and when he gets into his moods i just won’t answer him, but he just sends 50 pics and it’s rlly starting to make me scared. 

the day he showed up to my house , he was with another one of my friends and as creeped out as i was , i couldn’t just close the door in their faces so i went out w them. my friend had to go to work so she left, leaving me and this guy alone in his car. i asked to go home and he drove me in complete silence ( SCARIEST 30 MINS OF MY LIFE )  after he dropped me off , he texted me and said “ the whole car ride i could only think of pulling over and making u blow me “ 
I’m really starting to get scared and i need advice on how to get him to leave me alone. 
sorry for the length !!"
Should you hide bad grades?,"Yes I’m Asian and our parents are very strict luckily, my parents aren’t that strict, but my mom will always be disappointed when I have bad grades. The other day the mail came home with a grade report of the entire year, and my mom knows about the mail, just not the fact is is my grade report, should I, or should I not tell my mother the truth about my grades, or hide it?"

How do I become more charismatic?,"I am a 15 year old pubescent boy starting at a new school and I wanna know how to make a good first impression.

I also wanna be more charismatic and be a person that people enjoy being around. Not necessarily being popular, just not unpopular.
Problem is, I'm not really funny. I know I have to be myself, however, I was wondering if there were small details I could do to seem cooler. Maybe also some tips to where I can rest in myself better. Also I'm kind of short, and I've never really minded the jokes, but how can I, for example, use as an advantage?"
17 and my mum kicked me out and I really don't know what the right action is.,"I'm going to try and keep this as concise as possible. I've never had a good relationship with either of my parents, I haven't seen my dad in years and me and my mum either fight alot and don't talk at all. About two months ago (three months before my 17th) she kicked me out on the grounds that I don't listen to her at all and that I'm basically a bad son and not a functioning human being, It's probably worth mentioning that I'm a)diagnosed with GAD, OCD, persistent depressive disorder and that not only has she been physical towards me but before i was made to leave she punched me in the head.

It has since been about three weeks since and I have applied for school, and to get payments from the government as I live in Australia and that is as far as I've gotten. I wanted to go home for a very long time but it has now gotten to the point that I'm not even sure, I don’t want to seem dramatic but everyone has so far sorta seemed like they’re not on my side. The conditions on which I can come home are very vague and so far it seems that I'm just at the whim of how my mum feels, no one wants to give me any time frame and I’m expected to achieve well in school in an environment that I'm really not comfortable in (a family friends house)

I don’t know if I should apply for government housing which would in theory allow me to live independently or if I should just wait and see if my mum want’s to take me in but where I am now honestly I'm probably just gonna kms as it would seem the most logical all things considered. The person I’m staying with seems to think that I should wait but she’s also super hard to convince of anything and seems to think that inaction would be the best action.

I really don’t wanna live this life anymore and I don’t know what the hell I’m meant to do or think, but I know if I don’t do something soon then I'm probably not gonna make it to to school orientation and definitely not the sweet age of 17. 

I’m sorry if this seems like a mess or incoherent but I’m just getting to the end of my rope and need advice or honestly anything."
Is there something wrong with me,"So I fucked my sister. She’s 14 and I’m 15. 
It all happened because I was really horny and my sister is actually sexy as fuck and I felt like my dick was gonna explode if I didn’t do anything. Me and my sister are close we were in bed together watching her fav show stranger things when I decided to start making out with her and started taking her stuff off. And the sex was actually really good it’s just I don’t want to be labeled as a creep or something I just feel really weird that we did that but we both loved it"
I slept with one of my best friends crush,"Im a 17 years old guy who’s considered ”popular” but im very shy. I was at a party a week ago with a lot of my classmates and friends and everybody was kinda busted because we had been drinking alot.  

I have an inner circle of five friends who i know i can trust with everything. Well apperantly one of those friends have a big crush on a girl from our class but none of us had a clue that he liked her even though we are so close. I noticed that this girl he had a crush on was very interested in me throughout the night. So after a while i said fuck it and we started making out with her and one thing led to another and we ended up in bed and we fucked. 

In the morning one of the other friends in my close friend circle  told me that my other friend who had a crush on her went and cried on the couch when me and her went into the bedroom. The problem with this is that i don’t like her in that kind of way and i only did it because i was drunk af. Because of what i did that friend haven’t talked to me since then and I feel so fucking bad afterwards, do anybody have some advice on what i can say to him now to fix his broken heart?"
Dry Texters,"sooo i kinda like this guy (well i find him interesting), and i wanna become friends with him but i don't know how to start a conversation with him since i heard he's a dry texter. any advice on how to talk to dry texters?"

Fat shamed by someone you just occassionaly meet,"So, this happened today. I know this guy but not as close that we can be labeled as friends just constantly fat shamed me in my face in front of some acquaintances and friends. So what I did was just ignore him the first few minutes but then I figured out it did not stop him from insulting me saying things like my face is so round and fat and that my sister is way more prettier than me and etc. And i felt so frustrated that I want to just slap him in the face. 

Then I just snapped and jokingly say I don't need his presence and walk away. It stopped him for a while, thanks to my friends who knew that I was getting frustrated they took his attention away from me. 

Reflecting, on what I did earlier made me realize that I should've handled it with respect since he triples my age but acts like a child.

What should I say the next time this happens?
Thanks."
How can I get my mom to stop degrading me as a person?,"My mom has always said how shitty of a person I am my whole life. The many times I’ve confronted her on it she tries to flip it on me and make me seem like the bad guy accusing her of such thing. She had recent found out about my sister having sex even though she is 21, calling her a whore. When I confronted her about that as well she said she said no such thing. My mom has been manipulating my siblings and I for our whole lives. What is a possible way to get her to stop now that we are all past our teenage years?"
I'm trying to figure things out.,"I'm trying to figure things out. This is the year I start applying to colleges. I've had it figured out that I want to apply for musical theatre and work towards becoming an actor. I don't want this to change. But I don't want to stop myself from doing things I enjoy just to try and further myself in a career. I want to have tattoos, and piercings, and dye my hair. I want to have full sleeves of tattoos but I don't want to be denied roles because airbrushing over tattoos isn't in the budget. I guess what I'm asking is, should I look for different career paths? Should I conform to what casting directors will be looking for? I just don't know what to do. It's a stupid issue and yet it's one I can't stop thinking about."
"I really like my friend and I have for over a year, I can’t get over it!","So I really like my family friend, I so badly just want to tell him, but I am so scared of rejection(as it’s a family friend)  he is my age and really cute, he seems close to me, he has put his arm round me before, and laid his head on my shoulders, he also seems to always sit really close to me- not to others, and I have been watching. I might be just looking for signs though so I don’t know. I really really like him, I don’t know if he feels the same way. My annoying little sister, who’s 13, thinks he might like me as he completely ignores her when I am around and apparently acts differently.

I need to get over it somehow so I can either be with him, or join the dating world! But how!! Please give me advice, I need help, thanks :)"
Paranoid,"I am constantly feeling like everyone is looking at me, that something is wrong, I am always worried that I did something really stupid. Is this normal."
Am I being reasonable about my future?,"I am an Asian-American born in California to a family that lives comfortably. My mom works in cosmetology and has gotten an associates degree, but she doesn't use it. My father has a bachelors that he also doesn't use due to working the family business. Both parents have split, but both still want ""the best for me"". I never got the option to explore careers growing up. I was told I was to be a doctor from ages 5-12 and from 12 to now I'm being told that I'm to be a surgeon. Of course ""I get to"" specialize in whatever I want. I've gone through phases of straight out telling them that I don't want to be a doctor (ages 9-12) and then accepting it due to the fact that I don't have any other idea of what I wanted. I'm the stereotypical perfect Asian-American daughter with a 4.4*/3.9 GPA at the top 5% of her class. I am on a varsity sports team and have done leadership activities like ASB and councils. I work a summer job and have been saving up for a while just incase. 

I've always known in my heart that this dream of me isn't what I want to do but my parents want of me. Frankly, I'm tired of keeping up this perfect image of myself. I don't want to kill myself all through college for a career I know isn't me. Now here comes the catch. I have a boyfriend whom I love with all my heart. He currently is on the other side of the country since he's graduated early. We've had our ups and downs but I've never met someone as perfect for me as he is. He's coming to visit soon and I honestly cant wait to see him again.

I want to go to college where he is to get a bachelors in nursing or dental hygiene instead of becoming a surgeon, doctor, or whatever. Though it may seem like I'm uprooting my life for a relationship that who knows will last or not, moving away will give me freedom from my parents. I'd be able to pursue these other careers without them micromanaging me and telling me that I'm a disappointment of their ideals of me. I wouldn't be going to a UC... like they'd planned and would be going to either an average state university in his area or a decent private school there. I just dont see the point in going anywhere else and putting us through more long distance than we need to be. We may or may not work out. In the end, I'd have gained freedom, gotten a degree, and have been able to see more of America than I would have been if I didn't. 

What I'd love is a cozy house to call my own somewhere that's green and away from the city. I'd love to have a family down the road. I'd love to have a stable job that pays just enough for these wants and a little extra for a modest road trip sightseeing maybe once a year. That's what would make me happiest. 

Though I'd love if my parents supported me and helped me as if I was doing what they wanted of me, I'm ready to support myself if they don't. I'd get a job, get a loan and some scholarships if possible, and pay my bills while being a full time student. I know I can do it with or without their support in me. 

I'm being reasonable right? My biggest fear is wasting my life doing something meaningless to me."
Hey people,Again you have probably seen countless posts about parents but I need some advice. My parents have been being actual assholes lateley. They want me outside more but don’t let me go outdoors. My dad has been even worse. Threating to take all my shit away just for asking questions. None of my parents drink. I need help bad
Am I being paranoid or do I actually smell?,"This is honestly super embarrassing but lately, I’ve become very paranoid that I smell bad. 

I shower, brush my teeth, use deodorant, wear clean clothes, etc. Nobody at school ever tells me directly in my face that I smell, but sometimes people who sit behind me lean back in their seat, and I can’t tell if it’s because I do in fact smell or that they’re just getting comfortable. Sometimes people would cover the side of their face/nose/mouth with the sleeves of their sweater. There’s this one particular guy who sits behind me in one of my classes who I know is super sensitive to smells. He talks to people who sit close by and he was whispering about how something was “disgusting” (I couldn’t hear him that well) and it turns out he had been talking about something from a magezine in class we were reading. He also said something that sounded like “it stinks” to one of his friends but I couldn’t hear him that well so I’m not sure. He doesn’t lean back in his chair away from me or anything, he actually sits pretty close to my back.

Besides these things, no has ever acted weird or kept their distance from me, but I can’t tell if they’re just being nice/polite or I’m just being paranoid."
Should I prioritise my own issues or my sister's?,"I have an exam in 5 days that will basically determine the university I'm going to go to and it's stressing me out so much.

My sister has her final assignment due also in 5 days for her online university course and she is pressuring me to help her with it because she isn't that good with English. Knowing how her previous assignments took days when I helped her with it, I refused (yet I feel like a **** for doing so, irrationally???).

I tried telling her to do it herself because it literally is your course, therefore your responsibility, but she's not budging. I know that inevitably, I am going to somehow help her in these 5 days but I just want to know what other people would do, or say if they were in my situation.. thanks."
My life is boring,"Hi guys 
So actually The title says it all... 
But I would like to get some advice from you to make my life shitty and boring."
Reputation fix,"So Freshman year I messed up really bad I got into a lot of fights and a lot of people hate me and think I’m annoying and my own teammates don’t really like me anymore on football, wrestling, or volleyball. Everyone thinks I’m annoying or just don’t talk to me. I don’t really have a friend group cause the friends I do have all play different sports than each other so I just end up hanging out with people individually. How do I fix my reputation Sophmore year and how do I make a friend group? Or do I just transfer to a different school?"
My brother molested me,"My brother started molesting me ever since we both were very young. He would insert his fingers inside my vagina and there were instances where he would poke my nipples and stop talking to me/behave rudely if I didn't let him. I was around 6-7 years old at that point of time and he was three years older to me. Our parents never introduced the concept of consent to us or about sexual abuse, and I do understand now that it was probably just curiosity why he did that. However it didn't end there. When I was in grade 9, (he was in 12, not legally an adult, but 17 years old) one night he squeezed my breasts and asked if he could suck them. I was horrified shocked and said no, shoved him off and went away. He was alarmed that I had reacted that way and asked me not to tell my parents (which implies he knows how wrong it is). After that around 7 years have passed and I have never been able to get it off my mind, he never apologised to me and behaved as if everything was normal. I started distancing myself from him, as well as my family because it was unbearable for me to get compared to him at every step or the other, when I know what an absolute monster he is. One year back I learnt he attempted to molest one of his batchmates when he was drunk. I however have no definite proof of it or have not verified it myself, and only one of his classmates have told me this. A few months back (I am 20 now) I had an ugly altercation with my brother and I ended up calling him out for it in a fit of rage. He apologised and said it was a mistake, however I am not convinced. If it really was a one-time mistake, why would he molest his classmate? It just does not add up to me. I've seen a therapist and even though she was really good, even she tried to coax me to forgive my brother which isn't at all coming from me. She told me ""people make mistakes but people are not their mistakes"". It doesn't make sense to me because even though I agree with her, I think after one point of time there is a clear distinction between a mistake and a choice. I have gathered up enough courage to tell my parents and they are in shock. They are trying to help me out with it, but nothing that they are saying is helping me. He has always been the favourite and always been treated with bias, however I myself do not know what I want out of this. I'm in a huge mess. I do not know whether I will ever be able to even have good connections with my parents because I feel my brother is always in the middle. I cannot bear being close to anyone who is close with my brother. I am posting it here to ask for advice. My father has heart issues and he has taken it very badly and both of them are blaming themselves as failures as parents. My mother thinks it's going to get healed over time and has even gone as far as saying people have it worse than me. I do not know what to feel or say, as I do not believe I am in a competition in who gets abused more. The main thing I am worried about is I'm scared of my brother, because he seems like a psychopath to me. He has terribly strong opinions about woman empowerment, and how strong rape laws should be and he considers himself an all in all feminist and here he is, molesting his own sister. I think he is a potential sex offender and the most ideal thing would be if he would be locked in forever. I do not know how this works together and what really to do at this point of time. It has affected me beyond repair. I have body issies, trust issues and confidence issues simply because of this. I do not know what to do. "
My 13 yr old brother stole money from my mom,"So recently my mom withdrawed 200 dollars in cash and couldn't find it. Earlier today, we found the 200 in his drawer, and we have no idea what to do, he is troubled and keeps to himself but refuses to see a psychologist and all that... This is not the first time he stolen something... Help please :( "
18(f) road trip with Bf (18),"So this summer , I am planning to go on a road trip with my boyfriend. I’ve been together with him for about a year now . My parents don’t want me to go on this trip at all . It is a road trip to California . work a part time job and have been saving up for this trip . They don’t let me hang out with anyone ever . I have a car , so I tell them I have work and hang out with him . I really wish I didn’t have to lie to them . Anyways , I was wondering if I went on the trip in the summer , could they call the cops on me and do something ? Like I’m 18 and all , but I want to know what could happen . I plan to just tell them the day of I’m leaving for the trip and leave . I’m sure there’ll be consequences when I come back home that I will deal with later. 

(They don’t like the idea of me having a boyfriend at all . I’m Burmese and he’s Chinese . His family accepts me but my parents only want me to marry someone they want me to marry . They tried to make me talk to a guy they wanted me to marry on Facebook that’s from my home country . I deleted my Facebook account so I didn’t have to talk to him . I do plan to move out when I have a stable place to live . There’s always my boyfriends place if I ever got kicked out but I don’t want to live with him for long periods of time yet . I feel like that’s too much at a young age ) "
I have a concern,"Hello, I'm a 17 year old girl who had just graduated from a secondary school. I recently finished taking an important exam which majority of 17 year old students have to take. People said that our future is depending on the exam. We'll get good jobs if our results is good. But that is not my concern yet. My concern is that the result will be out around 3 or 4 months after the exam and those months are usually the time when students who took the exam search part time jobs. I would like to experience a part time job myself but my parents are against it. When I asked why, I don't really get a satisfactory response. Some reasons that they mention was how am I going to work everyday (transportation) and I won't even get that much money from working a part time job. They said it's better for me to look for something that I like and build skills from that. For example taking classes, etc. The thing is, those classes require fees and I feel bad to keep asking money from my family. Everytime I want something, I have to ask money from my father or mostly my brother. Of course they'll give it to me but I just can't help but to feel bad for them. The reason why I want to work is because I want to have at least some pocket money that I earned by myself. Maybe in a few months, I will continue my studies in a university and I can't expect my father to pay for all of my expenses. I do think that taking extra class would be nice, I do like arts and I want to learn how to paint but those classes mostly cost a fortune. Actually I have a lot more things to explain but I don't want to make this too lenghty. So, my concern is.. What should I do? Take a class or convince my parents to allow me to get a job? "
I lied to my friend...,"Hey, I made this account just cause I wanted some advice and wanted to know what I should do- I started playing WoW when I was 12 and since nobody really likes kids (especially in games like WoW) I said I was 15. My voice could easily pass for a 15 year old at the time and I wasn’t exactly immature so it was pretty believable. I made some friends who were 15/16, and they believed I was 15 at the time. I’m 14 (almost 15) now and they’re 17/18. They think I’m 17. I don’t know if I should tell them the truth, I know it sounds childish but I’m scared that they wouldn’t want to talk to me since I’m younger. Should I tell them or keep up the charade? And in the future, should I tell people my real age or say I’m older? I’m pretty lost."

How To Ask Her Out?,"There this girl that I like and she show signs she likes me but I dont know how to ask her out. Like I don't know how to ask her without coming on to strong and freaking her out?

Also here's some details we're both a seniors, I'm a introvert and shy (but still know how to have a convo) and she's extrovert and talkative (but not around me) we knew each other for 3 years now and during those 3 years it seems like we had alot of chemistry like she would mess with my hair, touch my arm, hug me (unfortunately it was those side hugs which I think is a bad sign but adding it because I really don't know) and she also don't refer to me as ""my friend Zayn"" she just introduce me as Zayn. "
UPDATE on my post from a few months ago.,"Okay so this year her and I don’t have any classes together but things are going great. I am a little nervous that she’s gonna get close with other guys, homecoming is right around the corner and her friends said I should ask her but she has said even if someone was to ask her she would reject them BUT today she said she was with her friends and she said everyone has gotten asked but her(talk about mixed signals) and she only sent that to me. I am confused what to do, I think I’m going to ask her at the football game this upcoming Friday, what do you guys think I should do?"

Girl issues,My ex who I used to be dating (now my friend) broke up with me because she wanted to be prepared to go into college and work. Idk how that makes sense or is reasonable at all but she wants to wait a couple of months before she gets back into any relationship..should I wait for her or leave her completely 
I’m so ashamed,"hey guys, I really need some help.
I’ve been dating this guy for about 2 months now and I already met his parents and been to his house numerous times but has never met my mom or been to my house. 
He keeps telling me he wants to meet my mom and see where I live but I’m too ashamed. 
My mom is really controlling and weird (that’s another story though) and us two live in a one bedroom apartment (I have the bedroom, my mom sleeps on the couch) it’s been like that since forever and I don’t want to seem ungrateful but I can’t help it. My boyfriends family has a lot of money and they have a beautiful house and I just keep feeling disgustingly poor. 
I know it’s really dumb to be ashamed of something like that...
I would appreciate any advice just please don’t be mean

Right vs wrong?,"I am in a situation where I don’t know what’s right or wrong or if I’m a bad person or not. In fact I can’t ever be sure who I am. I am always unsure. I fight back and fourth with my mom and we don’t get along. I try my hardest to avoid my mother and to avoid the weird things she does that triggers me. It doesn’t seem to help and somehow we end up fighting again. She yells at me some things that are really nuts and I know not to listen to those things but she says stuff about what I did wrong as well. I don’t know if what she’s describing it as is true or not. Even when the fight was started by her, she’d say “it gets us even for any of the times you started a fight”, etc.  or when I angrily told her to stop yelling about being stuck in the parking lot, she hollered that I fussed at her and made her too nervous to be able to cope with the situation. One time we were at my grandmas house. She had possessions she wanted to do some kind of weird work on there. I told her I wanted to go back home and didn’t say it mean either.... she yelled and said I was only thinking of myself and that I ruined her life. She said she wasn’t going to get this done because of me now. She apologized for that later on, and said she was wrong to yell at me and that I have to learn to consider others. She also said I usually get annoyed and start to tell her to stop doing something annoying out of anger. 

 She does really unstable things sometimes but I can’t tell what I am in the situation anymore .... I’m confused "
Why do friends always leave me alone after a while??,"    I have had groups of friends that I’ve been friends for years, but after a while they always happen to leave me alone and not wanting to hangout with me. This has happen to me twice. I’ve really haven’t had a friend who will want to talk to me and actually will be my friend. I know that people can change and it just makes me feel worse about myself. Since I probably have a low self esteem. 
    Like the first time it happened to me, they all pretended that I wasn’t there and flat out just left me like nothing had happened. While the second one, they all changed and stopped texting me like I’m the one who is starting the conversation and it’s just not right for me to do all the work. 
     The main issue is that I don’t get why people don’t want to be friends with me. I’m a really sweet person who just want someone to talk to and I will do the same back to you. I’ve had dealt with a ton of people leaving me behind or just left from being friends with me. I feel like I have dealt with too many and I don’t understanding why. "
"Please help, I don’t know what to do...(F/15)","Okay so for almost a week now I’ve felt the constant urge to... masturbate... I know it sounds odd, but it just happened suddenly. I masturbate to try and relieve the feeling but it doesn’t work. I’ve tried doing other things to keep my mind occupied, but it doesn’t seem to work either. It’s getting in the way of my daily life, and I’m incredibly frustrated that I’m feeling the need to masturbate all the time. I’ve been contemplating asking my mom to schedule a doctors appointment for me, or if I should wait a few more days to see if I still feel this urge. I don’t know how much longer I can wait though, it’s driving me crazy feeling like this. I don’t know what to do. I’ve done some research and it may be something called “Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder” which is where women are in a constant state of arousal and do not find relief after orgasm, and the feeling may last from days to weeks (direct description from the informational website) luckily this is treatable with medication and hormonal therapy. I’m just not sure if I should wait or ask my mom. She is a nurse so she would probably know something about it, but it’s weird and awkward talking to your mom about how you constantly feel aroused. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could give me some advice on what to do.  "
One piece of advice,"You’ve been there before. About to graduate high school, but you don’t know what to expect next. 

You have people all around telling you what you should do, but how do you know what to listen to and what to disregard. 

Knowing what you know now, what would be the one piece of advice you’d give to your 18-year-old chills graduating HS in a few weeks?

I’m not the smartest person in the world. I never went to college. I come from a rough household. 

I can’t possibly pass on information that I do not know. 

So, I’m asking you...

What would be the one piece of advice you’d give your kid who is graduating HS?

What do you wish you knew then that you know now???

I sincerely appreciate your support. 

Thank you,
Cory"
Moving too fast in my own life?,"I'm a [19/f], currently a sophomore in college. For as long as i can remember, I've always wanted to skip this chunk of my life and get to a place where I can settle down and begin my life. People tell me all the time about missing out on the ""college experience"" and I just don't know if I'm really missing out on anything. I've gone through my phase of partying every weekend and drinking more than I ever imagined I would. That made me satisfied for a period of time, but now I'm back in a place that I wish I could just drop everything and move on. I hate this place of being at a stand-still, doing nothing but going to school and working a part-time job that leaves me feeling bored every day. I have so many ambitions and things I want to do with my life, and I wish I could enjoy things as they were now, but my mind is constantly stuck in the future. It doesn't bother me much, thinking ahead, but I feel that it holds me back from enjoying the moment.

I don't know what I can do to change my mind, I've thought this way for so much of my life. I want to be able to wake up in the morning and be excited about what I have to do, and I want to know how to make the best of the present."
I am lonely,"I want to know what it's like to love someone unconditionally. I want to know what it's like to have someone to talk to. I want to know what it's like to *really* know someone. Honestly, I don't even know myself. I feel like I'm not the person I want to be. I keep dreaming and imagining being someone I'm not. I don't want to be me. I am not me. The truth is, I don't have anyone.. not even myself. "
Wow,Hello everyone I'm currently fourteen and I just need someone to tell me something.

Friend Talking About Shooting School,"Throwaway obviously

Preface:

My friend has had a very troubled life. I've known him a long time. 

To be honest we're just friendly acquaintances but we went to the same elementary school, and ended up in the same middle school and high school (there's a lottery to get in). 


He has a really shitty family life, and he's a closeted gay person who also pimps himself out to old guys for money. The counselor and a few other people know about it. He says some kids at school said something about him to the principal and it could ruin his life. If it does, he says he might kill those people and then himself.

He would also kill himself if I reported him.

I'm not really sure where to go from here. "

How do I get a girlfriend (14),"There's this girl I really really really like but I'm not sure how to flirt well, ask her out, dates, or just in general get a girlfriend. Also if I could get some advice on how to be a good boyfriend that would be great! Thanks in advance!"
"This is a southern baptist church, and I am not a fundamentalist....","The visiting pastor at this church were I'm paid to video is off on this anti-gay rant, people are cheering and I have never felt more awkward.

I am technically a member of this church, how I got the job. But I am really starting to view this as more of a job. In the past I have desired to ""strengthen my faith"" but as of now I don't know. My supposed lack of faith led to my breakup with an otherwise really nice guy. How can I be devoted to something that I may fundamentally disagree with...."
Am i a loser if i am not invited to parties? (possibly NSFW),"im a 15 year old boy.

I go to a small private high school so we dont have all of the ""staple"" events that the average high school has.  For example, we dont have homecoming dances because we dont have a football team.  We also lack a few other major events, but i cant think of them at the moment.  So anyways, because of the lack of events at our school, a lot of students at my school go to the events at other schools.  And once they make a connection with someone from that school, they get invited to their personal house parties too.  But i just get so frustrated by that, because no matter how many friends i have at this school, i never get invited to the big parties.  And at my own school i actually am very well-liked, and i do have a few friends at other schools, but they arent the ones that throw the parties.  I used to not care, but now i just feel so alienated.  But then some people actually threw a BIG community-wide, teen-only party that i was actually invited to!  But i kept getting so anxious about it, and everyone was going just to grind and hook-up with girls, and i was really afraid.  So i didnt go.  And whats worse is that i punished myself for my bad decision and kept reliving it like a nightmare in my head.  But then i realized that the real reason that i was turned off by the hooking up and grinding was because i think im gay and i hate it.  Ive always had a kind of attraction towards guys, but i never paid any attention to it.  But now ever since ive been introduced to masturbation and pornography, my same-sex attraction has been more pronounced.  Im only ever attracted to gay porn and i fantasize about sexual encounters with my guy friends.  So now im even more anxious and scared because i dont know anyone who is gay and im worried that it will alienate me even more by the friends i have.  There's really a lot more to this story, and the problems im having now, but ive never been able to get advice about this topic, and i want to keep this post focused on it.  And ive already typed out so much!  So please, i really need some advice in any form, or if you can recommend a better subreddit to post this to.  And if you have a question or need more info, instead of downvoting, you can just ask and ill answer.  thank you!

EDIT: and one more point is that i can't help thinking that what social things that my friends do is the ""right"" thing to do.  I wish that parties wasn't what kids are ""supposed"" to do.  I wish i could tell my friends how i feel, because then they probably would invite me to things and be supportive (at least some of them).  I wish i could grow up and have good experiences and be proud of them.  And most of all, i wish i could accept the fact that im gay, and that there would be people that i would fit in with, and truly feel like a strong part of something good.

Im sorry for being a downer, i just need to get this off my chest because ive held it in for soo long!"
Need Advice on Dating with Hobbies,"Hello everyone. I've been lurking reddit for a while, and so many stories have inspired me to start posting on here, so here goes.


I'm 17/M, and I have an admitted history of being overly shy when it comes to talking to girls. I have, however worked on this and have mostly overcome this, with a combination of maturing and having supportive friends.


I've started to get serious with a few girls before, but have stopped short from dating, mostly because they cut me off before I had a chance to really ask them out, and they would end up dating several guys which have ended up in disaster.


Now, I'm a pretty well rounded guy who is both nice and fun, and, not to sound self righteous, I have been told I'm good looking as well. On the flip side though, I take part in rather geeky hobbies, such as gaming, Warhammer 40k table top, and Magic: the gathering, just to name a few. While this hasn't presented itself to be a problem yet, I'm a bit nervous for any future relationships I may get in to. More times than not when I meet a girl, they see the nice, fun, party side of me. However, there is a geeky side to me as well, and I fear that when a girl sees that side, she will no longer be interested in me. 


In such a case, I'm probably better off, but on the other hand, this is likely to become a repetitive cycle, seeing as the girls I meet are at social events with friends. I pretty much just want advice on how to handle this sort of situation, if anyone has experience with this sort of thing. 


To those who read all of this, you are truly awesome and deserve a cookie. Thanks for reading!"
Should a 19 yr old be able to sleep over at her boyfriend's house?,"Here's the situation: Tomorrow is my boyfriend's birthday and he lives an hour away. I don't have a car, but my mother and I are going to the same town the same day because we have an optometrist appointment in the afternoon. She can easily drop me off at my boyfriend's place but she would have nothing to do for the rest of the day/night while I spend it with him and have dinner with his family. My most convenient ride home would be my dad. He works and commutes in the same city at night, so he can take me back home in the morning. We haven't spoken about it yet, but she said ""Hey I think we need to talk"" so i'm assuming she isn't okay with me sleeping at my boyfriend's...if that's the case she's going to wait and find something she doesn't really need to do until i'm done. That's just illogical, if my dad could easily take me home.

I go to college and am only home for the summer. While in college I had the freedom to make my own decisions based on what I believed was right and wrong without any sort of control from my parents. I believe that it should be okay for me to go stay over at my boyfriends house because (and my parents are aware of these) I went on a lake trip with him and his family and we stayed at their house, I visited my boyfriend just last weekend and wouldn't have stayed anywhere else since I was with him the whole time. I'm 19 and he's 20, we've been dating for about a year now.

How can I communicate with my mom to get her to understand that though she may not agree that it's okay, she needs to respect my decision? How else can I support my argument?"
what do i do during a date?,"first, off i'm terrible when it comes to conversations, and i want to ask this girl out but don't know what to talk about or do during the date."
What should i do?,"Hi i'm Miller! I'm 15 and i'm in highschool.
Last week i started to like one of my classmates(of course a girl),and i just tried to speak to her , we talked the whole weekend on YM about different stuff. On Sunday she told me that she really likes me,i said the same thing...On Monday when i got to school she was considering me her boyfriend(i was so fullfilled with that). Sometimes we were hugging and talking and stuff.But in the same exact day an asshole noticed our ""relationship"" and started to chat & flirt with her. I let him do his episode being sure that she won't give a fuck and that she would remain confident...but i guess i made a mistake letting him flirt with her. I realised she was not as nice as i thought after she speaked with that guy for the whole day! In that evening we chatted ,aswell on YM, and she was talking with him...I asked her ""What kind of friends are we?"" and she said ""Very good friends."" I understood,she rejected me...I couldn't sleep that night and the next day i was fucked up!
Now she doesn't even speak to me...
No happy end here...  :'(
Well there seems to be a happy end just because of the friends that take care of me.I have to thank you for reading my ""novel"" and now i tend to realise that this was not such a big loss...Thank you fellow redditers! =)
Happy end!"
I just came in my pants. I need some help here,I just had my first real sexual experience. I sucked her tits and made out with her. i then got ontop of her and started to finger her. midway through it happened and i came in my pants. i didnt stop fingering and didnt change facial expressions. i kept going and im pretty sure she didnt enjoy it very much either. i went to the bathroom and she didnt see. i then ran into my laundry room and hastily put on new underwear and jeans. i think she noticed the different jeans but didnt say anything. what do i do? i feel absolutely abismal. what the fuck is wrong with me. 
changing up the look of this subreddit a lot,"hey everyone, so i'm pretty much redesigning this whole subreddit starting in around 20 minutes. I don't know how long i'll be working on it, but it could be for a few hours, so just letting you guys know if you visit this subreddit  during that time, it may look weird and uncomplete. It will look much better when the redesign is done, and if you guys have any suggestions for the look of this subreddit, just comment and i'll take it into consideration. thanks everyone for your understanding!

"Hey, just a quick bit of input..","This CSS fucking sucks!!!! Who the fuck is the shitty programmer who did this? okay subreddit idea, but the CSS really is fucking horrible! The submit button doesn't even work. I had to go the front page, and submit a post and change the subreddit to AdviceForTeens. The colors and highlighting fucking suck, the dr seuss quote in the back looks bad and doesn't go with the theme or the subreddit, the upsmiles look like shit, the font looks like shit, there's some weird chick staring at me from the corner of the screen in a blurred out bubble, and everything else looks like shit. I'd be happy to help if you guys need help with the CSS, just don't ban me for saying this shit. I'm just giving you guys some constructive criticism because I can't look at the subreddit for 5 minutes without my eyes hurting. Also, Kyle, stop asking people to promote this and shit. Just let people come and maybe post it a few times yourself to [/r/teenagers](/r/teenagers) and [/r/highseddit](/r/highseddit)  and stuff. Anyway, change the CSS or just make me mod so i can do it myself. Thanks for listening, and remember i'm not hating on the subreddit I just think it looks like shit. lol"
I have two Options but I need help please help,"So I’m in this pen pal program there’s two days of it, 30 kids from my school and 30 from other school. The first day past, as I was paired with a girl who is amazing and genuine(I’m a junior and she’s a senior). She had to follow my high school schedule from period 3 to 6. We had such a great time and became close friends, and we were excited for the second day, which is a month away, to see each other where I follow her schedule and meet new people. 

HOWEVER on that same day I have an Over-Night trip for my orchestra(This is the top orchestra in the high school) and I’m the most important one. I play bass and the other two bass players can’t go because they don’t want to. That day we’ll play for fun and professional would give us advice. Then we’ll go watch the New York philharmonics and visit Fredonia for a college tour. My good friend is going but she knows no one and really wants me to go on the trip(Btw I’m a guy). I don’t want her to be alone for the two days.

I don’t know what to do, picking one just gives me guilt towards the other. What do you guys think would be the best thing to do?"
Scared to Talk in Class...,"Hey guys!

So I need some help. Theres this cute guy in my philosophy class and originally we didnt talk, but one day he started talking to me and we became friends. I started to like him, but I realized he was not interested in me (never really waits for me after class, doesnt really talk unless I start the convo). Since then I havent contributed to class discussions because I dont wanna looked dumb in front of him. How do I stop being nervous and giving this guy so much power over me? I dont want my grade to suffer because of this.

Thank you!!"
HELP,"okay so maybe like three months ago i left my ex that i've been with for a year and a half because he wasn't mature enough and felt like we weren't on the same page relationship wise. He also had some toxic behaviour. So now, iv'e started to date this other guy who is actually my roomate. Iv'e told him that i wanted to take it easy and wait before i talk about it to my family because i don't want to give the impression to them that im the kind of girl to just jump relationship to relationship naively looking for ""true love"". Im frustraded because we have a really good chemistry that ive never had with someone before and we genuinely get along so well. ive been living with him for the past 6 months and it feels like we've always been friends. Am i going to fast into another relationship? Am i doing the right thing by taking it slow and hiding him from my family for a while ( just so you know he was completly fine with this and really understands)"
There is a guy in my class making me really uncomfortable,"Okay, so there is this guy in my physics class who keeps making fun of me and irritating me. It started with him just making comments about how I look or what I say and him telling me to 'get back to the kitchen' or 'make him a sandwich' which was irritating but I could get over it, but he has switched to a different tactic. He is now calling me his 'girlfriend' and keeps trying to touch me and keeps blowing kisses at me e.c.t. This was really annoying and uncomfortable but I dealt with it but it is getting worse, like on Thursday he hugged me from behind and whispered in my ear 'it's okay baby you can tell me what's wrong'. This made me really uncomfortable. We are both 15. I don't want to be labeled as a tout, what should I do?"
I think i had a wet dream,"I'm a 14 year old girl I've lost my virginity, and I don't know what too tell my grandma about the big wet spot on the bed. Do I just tell her I had too much water before bed or just come out with it."
Trying to get out of a toxic friendship.,"Hi! First-time poster on Reddit here. I am having a bit of a struggle with this friend of mine she has become a toxic individual who I think is just a compulsive liar. I mean she lies a lot. Like she has told me this numerous times that she is either a foreign princess or some sort of a rich millionaire and uses all of this expensive makeup. Which I know for a fact is all bullshit and crap she made up.

I would ask her simple questions trying to prob this lie in a way like what was her official title and where did she live and what did her castle look like, stuff like that. And you know what she did she would either blatantly avoid the truth or google some image of a palace and call it hers. That type of crap. And then she would go about talking about her mom and all this family stuff which for the most part is her just over exaggerating the story. I have met her mom and she is a really nice although strict lady.

the truth that I am getting at here is that I have tried all sorts of methods to deliberately remove myself from her but nothing has worked and the only other option I have is just not talking to her which would mean not talking to my actual friends who I enjoy the company of.  I really need advice on how I should deal with this situation and what I should do next."
toxic friend???,"so i have this friend and i think our friendship is toxic but i’m not 100% sure. Here’s our history: 
we went to elementary school together but we weren’t really friends because she was very quiet. However she was best friends with one of my good friends so we were friendly with eachother. We went to different middle schools and I had a huge group of friends and i was very social. I found out that she was transferring to my middle school for seventh grade and i decided to be nice and show her the ropes of the school and walk her to her classes and introduce her to people and let her eat lunch with my friends and i. I remember telling my friends that she would eventually get comfortable and make her own friends. but that never happened, she followed me around for weeks and slowly overtime because a part of our friend group. She wasn’t really friends with any of the other girl’s though, she was just always with me. we got really close and i really liked her, we were very alike and i was glad that i finally got to know her. Near the end of seventh grade however i realized something. She didn’t have 1 single friend that i hadn’t introduced her to, she never disagreed with me, and i never hung out with anyone without her anymore. Even my friends that didn’t go to our school she would follow me to hang out with them and eventually it just became expected that we came as a pair. Skip 4 years later to sophomore year of high school. My social circle has shrunk immensely and i’ve lost the vast majority of my friends. I have about 5 friends but every one of them is friends with this girl too. We are still very very close friends, and she still follows me everywhere, texts me all the time (a bit obsessively) and inserts herself into any relationship i make. Most people at our school will only hang out with both of us not just one of us because we are always together. One of my friends won’t talk to me anymore because we used to be really close but after this girl convinced our guidance counselor to switch her into all my classes my whole life was consumed by her and i didn’t talk to that friend as much. I don’t get lunch with other people because once i did and she texted me long paragraphs about how she felt like i didn’t want to have lunch with her and like i was excluding her. She didn’t have any friends that she had made on her own until this year. Now she has a few friends that she did make on her own and that i’m not super good friends with and i’m grateful for that but now i’m stuck because i don’t have a life outside of her and when i think about my life before she came to my school compared to my life now i am so isolated. She encourages all of my bad descions and still has never once disagreed with anything i have said. she invited herself to everytbing i do and follows me and it’s like i can’t have a conversation with someone without her barging in or just standing there listening. I am scared that i will eventually not even have shared friends with her and i will have 0 friends except for her. What do i do? How do i make real friendships with people that aren’t a three way friendship including her? how do i become less close with her so my whole life isn’t consumed by her"
How to tell my brother to stop smoking weed in the house?,"Last school year my brother went off to a college across the state. Among many reasons, he decided to transfer to a school near our house so he moved back in. It seems like he developed a habit (or maybe a more apparent one) of smoking weed when he was gone and has brought that habit into our house. He now sleeps in the basement and has it smell like skunk. I don’t know if my parents realize it or not, or they just don’t care, but I don’t want the house smelling like weed. I’m totally ok with him smoking weed, but I want him to do it outside or in the garage, not in the basement or the bathroom. How can I tell him that in a non confrontational way?"
The guy I used to like and maybe still do,"

It was autumn, october, everything was new for me expect my best friend, at least I had her among those people I didn’t know. 

I really wasn’t planning on starting to like someone, to have a crush on someone. Mainly because the guy i liked for years hurted me to the point I never want to feel love again. 

One day my best friend told me about this guy( lets call him John). Now my best friend knew John as a really nice and shy guy. She thought it’d be really good if I started to like someone who’s worth it and wouldn’t be like the past guy.

In the beginning I wasn’t interested in him at all, I began to see him every day, every time I would go out and slowly without noticing I had fallen for him. (Also just to put it out there, we were never friends and still are not.)

Now I told my best friend that I started to like him and she was happy because she had hopes that he’s a good person, I also told two other friend about him. Now lets name this other two friends Lola and Laura. 

Me and Lola would kinda be goofy around him because that’s just how I was around my friends and I didn’t want to act different just because I liked John or to impress him( being goofy sometimes around him also doesn’t mean that I was goofing around laughing loudly or talking loudly, basically doing something to get his attention). When I would get jealous Lola would go to John and just look at him angry, also she would call my name every time she saw him. 

In the other side my cousin had a friend who knew John so I immediately told my cousin to ask her friend what kind of person was John,(lets name my cousins friend Pete). 

Pete told my cousin that John wasn’t a good person he was kind of an asshole and very selfish, and that I wouldn’t be his type mainly because I’m not the type of girl to dress those fancy dresses and go to the club every friday. The description that Pete gave my cousin was very very different from what my best friend thought John was, and that was immediately a turn off lets say for me. 
I tried to forget him because I wasn’t prepared to be hurt more just like the last time. 

Now a year has past and John never looked at me last year, maybe sometimes. Now everytime we run into each-other he just stares at me, also we have sport class together, and he always looks at me, my friends always catch him staring at me. 

My question is: Why is he looking at me ?Is it because of the things my friend would do in front of him or he just stares at me without a reason? I know this was long but I wanted an advice from someone who might maybe know the real answer and can help me so I don’t have to haunt my self with those thoughts anymore."
My attention span is so short now and i have so much difficulty doing normal things,"hi i straight up made a reddit account just for this because its been bothering me for so long, im diagnosed with a few mental illnesses and some side effects do include a lot of demotivation, even from things that i really enjoy. recently ive noticed my attention span is so short like ill be switching between social medias every other post because i find myself bored i cant sit for whole movies and i just start feelijng nervous when i force myself to sit through stuff. ive got so much work to do for school due tonight and im worried i wont get it done, ive done like two out of eight assignments and im so lost on how to not feel like this? any way to motivate myself to do homework? to siot through it and get it done? i have good grades and i dont want them to suffer from this.  thank u :-0"
How to go to a rave by your self and have a good time,https://youtu.be/-tEL9iPxVXI
I don’t know what I want to be when I grow up,"I’m starting high school in like six months and I have to choose if I want an AP class or not. Now this seems pretty easy but not for me apparently. The high school teacher that teaches the course said “if this doesn’t help you in what you want to be when you grow up then don’t do it” this makes sense but I don’t know what I want to be. I thought I wanted to be a business owner but I don’t think I would enjoy that anymore, as it would have me interacting with people on a daily basis which isn’t what I like. I thought maybe I would like to be a mechanic but that would put my body under stress I don’t think I could take. I also want to do a sport which would take about 3 hours of study time away. And the course usually gives two or three hours of hw. I don’t know what I want to be and if taking an English or history course would help. I tried to take quizzes but those did not help at all. It just sucks because everyone knows what they want and I don’t. So if anyone could help I would appreciate it."
My friend is flirting with me?,"First time posting here, I guess I need your opinion cause I'm a bit confused of what to do.

(Sorry for the format, I'm in my phone)

Last Saturday I met a friend to spend the afternoon in a park, since we haven't seen each other for a few months (we're both 19 and going to college now). Everything was great, we caught up with our things, fooled around, then we lay down on the grass to listen to music. Then night came, I accompanied her to a fast food nearby so her parents could pick her up. They came and so our day ended.

So here's what happened that have me thinking till now:
When we were laying in the grass, she got a bit closer to me and asked about my previous relationships, like if I had a girlfriend, if I was talking to someone, if I got kissed in the last time, and this caught me completely out of guard. I answered and asked the same, then started to talk about her relationships, all of them a little bitter-sweet dramas. Then, she told me that she made out with a friend in a ""steamy moment"", all because she was feeling it.

She's a friend now, but she used to be my crush in high school, and I was wondering what could happen if I tell her this. What could happen if I kiss her without reason.

I know this is a long post, but I don't want those generic answers on Google.

tl:dr, I think a friend is flirting with me and I want to flirt back but dunno how"
She told her friend she just wants to be friends but sends all signs she’s interested,"


So I liked this girl for like a year (still do) I told her I liked her when I was drunk like 4 months ago. That’s when we started talking a little bit more. But we still had practically no contact apart from the occasional look from across the classroom. But a month ago we went to a party. I was drunk she wasn’t she doesn’t really like it when I drink but when I stared getting less and less drunk we just relaxed on the bed for 2 hours with her head on my shoulder the entire time. That’s when we started texting and sending pictures and such. But the day after she told my friend she just wanted to be friends. Which I found out today. But that’s the confusing part she always asks the teacher if I can sit with her in math class. We get a private room because we both blow ass in math. In the the break we sit on a couch and she is always all over me. With her legs over mine we also hold each other’s hands a little awkwardly for example she takes my hand says “wow your hands are much bigger than mine” than just holds my hand for a few minutes. She asked me if I just liked her or “loved” her I said I loved her (love in my language is basically the best translation but it isn’t that big of a deal as it is in other places like America) then she sent this string of emojis 😊🤭❤️. We always talk about having a movie marathon together. She is usually the one that brings it up. I always say she can come whenever she wants. She says she will come over when she comes home from her vacation. So that’s pretty nice. But we had a small argument about a week ago about my snusing habits which is basically a small package of nicotine you put in your lip. It is basically the same as smokes but with out the lung cancer and the awful smell. She said if I ever did it she would never be my friend again. Of course my friends told me to tell her because she would find out eventually so I told her. She said we could still be friends and that she was joking. But she was mad at me so I told her I’ll give her space. Which she didn’t want but I said I didn’t wanna talk if your just gonna send pictures of your roof that’s when she said OKAY I AM NOT MAD AT YOU. Which practically reverted everything to normal. And we started talking 24/7 again. So do you guys think she likes me or just playing with me?

she has never been in any serious relationship. Neither have I

she told me about a dream where she kissed a stranger once. She sort of inclined it was me

she has never kissed anyone. She did watch a Netflix movie where someone kissed and said omg so cute their kissing then I asked who. Then she said “you and me😉😉😉» 

I left her on read once so she started started spamming the “all I want” song from Olivia Rodriguez and stated it was literally her love life on private snap story. Which is like a half sad love song

We’re both 15. I am male she’s female 

Tl;dr. Told girl I liked her while drunk. Girl tells friends she only wants to be friends but she send all signs she likes me. Texting, constant looks, really touchy, had her head on my shoulder for 2 hours straight, constantly talks about wanting to have a movie marathon"

What can I do to a high school bully ?,"I’ve been thinking about what to do for a very long time but just can’t think of anything plausible for this bully. He constantly humiliated me in-front of my whole class and makes rude remarks whenever I see him

I’ve decided that I want to do something about it (make him feel the same way) but how would I do it. I need some ideas of how to get back at him or make him feel humiliated, nothing physical because of strict rules

Question about love,"There this girl have crush in me , but she has kinda inappropriate photos like having close shot of her breasts / boobs in social media 

What should i do

Reject her ?"
I am socially awkward and can’t tell a girl I like her,"I am a 16 year old male, a junior in high school 

Well to be short I am extremely socially awkward and always have trouble telling a girl I like her.

Once I liked a girl for 9 years and never told her anything.

It’s easier for me to make friends than to tell a girl that I like her

I honestly don’t know what to do. I am honestly thinking about asking my friend to tell her for me.

What should I do?

TL;DR: I am socially awkward and can’t tell a girl I like her"
A little story for ya...,"So I really feel in an empty space right now, let me tell you the reason why: So I met this girl in school and we just met on social media and texted and stuff. Then we actually started meeting in passing periods, whatever time we had, we used, we had so many jokes and fun with eachother. We passed so many notes and made weird eye contact that also made us laugh. The thing is that we were never able to talk to eachother much because the closer we became, the more shy I got. By a year or so, I was barely able to even sit by her at a table without holding my breath because of how shy i was. As you already figured, ive caught feelings. I was better off like this, having friends and crushes, as i would not be ready to have a date and take on that responsibility at that time. And as dumb as i was, another girl came up and i instantly got attached to her, our friendship eventually disappeared, we just texted for homework help which we do partly now, but after i started dating this other girl i knew i couldnt be responsible. I broke up with her so she could find better people then me. So these days at school, we still make eye contact somehow where ever i look, its never the same because we just look. Every corner i look at i always make eye contact with her. I miss those times, where we would just be buddies til the end. I want to build that bond back, but my shy self wont let me. All i can do is look and see her everywhere. I feel that ive receded in life back to when i met her, but shes no longer the person i see in passing peiod talking to me and waving. We always high fived, and i wish we could go back in time. But it always leads back to her. No, im not planning to date her, i just want to start over and become best friends with her again. someday ill gain the guts to actually be the person to high five her, as shes the person who usually does it. Though it may seem little, it goes a long way for this guy. I really want this friendship back, without it, im sitting in sand, trying to get her off my mind, finding hobbies so i could do it, but it all leads back to her. I tell you this story so i dont die of holding this thought in every second of the day. to her even though she wont see it: im sorry that i was so why not being able to talk to you when i had the chance, i wish i could fix that from the start i met you. thanks. im sorry if i hopped to random topics that you couldnt understand."
I have a crush on my brothers friend.....,I have a crush on my brothers friend who regularly stays the night. He is really nice but flirts with a lot of girls and openly talks about it whenever I'm there. We are both the same age and get along really well. I just don't know what to do since he always invites me to hang out with them and I just get so nervous. Any advice?
Is this okay? Is it considered sexual harassment? Should I be concerned?,"I am 16 years old. I was with 2 friends (one being a girl who is my best friend, another being a boy who is a friend of ours from school). All of us had taken a few sips of alcohol (but we were not completely drunk as we could perfectly function normally), we all decided to lie down on a couch. My best friend and I sitting beside each other and the boy laying on his stomach on top of both our legs. We stayed like that for a few minutes until I begin to feel the boy place his hand on my leg, at first at didn’t think it was a problem until he began to squeeze and move up and down my leg. Since it’s been going on for about 5mins he then asked what his limit was, referring to how high up his hand can go and what areas he couldn’t touch. This kept going for about 25mins. At times I would take his hand lower if I felt uncomfortable. During this time I tried to get my mind off it by using my phone. It wasn’t until he left when I really thought about it and there is now this uncomfortable feeling in my chest that won’t go away and I suddenly felt scared. While it was happening I thought I was okay with it but now I realize that I’m not and I’m afraid if he tells anyone. I’m not the kind of person whom would do something like this as it was my first time having someone touch me like that, and if word comes out I’m afraid to explain myself (I’m not quite social). I’m mad at myself for not saying how I felt, but at the time I thought it was okay despite feeling a little uncomfortable (I was confused I guess). He also hugged me from the back for about 5mins and would place his hand on my breast and I had to push his hand away a few times. He did say “you do realize where my hand is at right?” and still continue to leave it there but I still didn’t say anything and only push it away. I have also been talking about it with my best friend but I need more advice, specifically from people who have experienced something similar."

I dont know what to do,My crush has a boyfriend but I've had a crush on her for such a long time and super hard as well it's getting hard to keep quiet. What should I do?
Addicted to Social Media,"I often feel the need to post and update my feed. I run a page with a mix of topics: memes, art, selfies, photography, etc. I find myself feeling incredibly sad when someone unfollows me. It doesn't matter if they know me or not. I get sad. Same goes for when a post doesn't get as many likes as the recent one. What should I do?"
"I (17m) am conflicted about dating, but a couple of girls fell in love with me , and I don't know what to do. After having sex with a couple of my classmates (16f) situation got even worse.","I am 17 years old bisexual male, although nobody knows that. I have never before thought of having a relationship with girls, and especially not with boys, because I don't feel like it's right thing for me to do, I just can't commit. I prefer women by far, but there are exceptions. But anyway that's not the point.

In my class there are only 3 boys including me,and 17 girls. It has become obvious to me that the girls adore me, they always call me hot, sexy, beautiful... They would sometimes even slap my butt, or grab my nipples. One girl does that all the time, let's call her Kate. On numerous occasions they told me that I am the hottest guy in school, which I find very flattering, but i don't belive in that. 

I flirt with all of the girls, that's just the way i am. Anyway a couple of them asked me out, but I rejected them. They are pretty, really pretty, but I just don't want a relationship. I don't know how and why. We always talk about sex, correction they. I kinda find it upsetting. 

One day we got so horny that we created a sex grupe on messenger. 8 girls and me. We talked for a couple of days about all the nasty things. And Kate asked me, so when will we fuck? I answered something like: Whenever you want, baby.it was a joke, more or less. So she said right now. I said i can't, let's do it after the school. I still didn't believe that it would happen. 

After the school I, Kate and 2 other girls went to the Kate's house . They were her Bffs. I thought it was a joke, who wouldn't? Two of the girls had boyfriends(including Kate), and i just couldn't believe. When we finally came, we sat down on the couch. I had a shot, and then they started touching my legs, i got aroused ,and so it began. 3 girls were giving me a blowjob, fucking unbelievable. Then after 10 m, Kate and her friend started striping . While one didn't one to do it, because of her ""boyfriend""(she probably didn't want to lose her virginity like that, or something) other's took of their tops and pants . I still can't believe how beautiful Kate is, she was the other girl that had a boyfriend. Also she was a virgin. After an hour of the good stuff, we went home. 

Kate from then on always insists for as to go on a date, but i just cant. She touches me all the time, it's really hard. She still has a 'boyfriend' , so that makes the situation much more difficult. And it also puts me in a weird position. 

There' s also a girl called Z, she always implies how she would love to fuck me, in subtle ways. She is allso from my class. She is in the sex group, but I haven't slept with her. She is the funniest girl i know, but argh... I don't know. 

There's alsso Mary, she thinks that i love her. But that can't be further from the truth. We have been flirting online for about a couple of months, i only flirt to flirt. She sad that she loved me, and it makes me sad. I once sand a shirtless pick , and she sand me nudes. She is Austria now, sooo.... She is in love, and i don't want to break her hart, but i must. 


Also i have a feeling in my gut that my friend for another class may like me. He always touches my shoulder, arms and back. He could be just friendly, but what do i know? He is hot for sure, but i don't want to ruin our current relationship. And also i don't want people to know that for me. 

For the end i have a couple of girls(who i don't even know) writing to me all sorts of stuff,but all they really want is to date. And i don't. I went so far with one of them(girl from neighborhood), that we slept together, we never dated. And there's this guy Nash. He is from a foreign country , i have been talking him.I don't know him, but he always asks me weird questions. He is gay for sure,really gay. I'll probably block him.

So, what should i do? Should I date one of them, and if so who? I am really afraid of getting in a relationship/s, I just don't see myself in one. I feel like i can't commit, and will break somebody's hart. Advice please!"
My parents forced me into a degree I hate,"I am f(18) and I am in my first year of university. My parents really pushed for me to apply for “honorary” degrees such as medicine and law. I am now currently studying law. I absolutely hate it. I am completely and utterly unhappy to the point that I hate going to uni and I am not interested in doing my work. My sister is currently in honours (genetics) for a bachelor of science degree, and they expect me to study a degree of the same caliber. They’ve told our entire family and all our friends what I am studying so I am scared to change and appear as the “disappointment” of the family. 

My real passion is English and music, and I’ve tried to bring it up with my parents but they simply brush it off saying that’s no way to provide for a family. I don’t know whether I should flunk out, stick out my whole degree etc. 

Any and all advice is appreciated"
Third Wheel vs. Bad Friend,"My two best friends are in a relationship. Sometimes they like to spend time we'd usually spend together just with each other. Which is fine, I'm happy for them and I understand wanting some time alone with your s/o, but then it came to my attention that they're going to have the next period alone together anyway. 

It kindof hurt that I have to spend lunch alone while they get to socialize with each other,  but I don't ever want to make them feel bad for being together.

How do I tell them about how I feel without making them feel like shit?"
me and my boyfriend went too far yesterday,"so yesterday me (15f) and by boyfriend (15m) met up at his. we chatted for a bit, had lunch, talked about videogames and whatnot. he went in for a hug and i was happy to hug back, weve hugged before. we ended up kissing, cuddling, making out and talking about the future for a bit. he asked me if i could take off my shirt, i wasnt sure if he was serious but he said he was. i need to say here that i was NOT pressured into this, i felt comfortable and safe around him and he didnt act like i had to. we ended up making out more as he touched my breasts (with my consent). i ended up taking off my bra and it felt really good at the time, he said i was beautiful and he loved me. after a few more minutes, he suddenly pulled back and got awkward. he seemed to kind of snap out of it, and he said that if we kept going, he was afraid we would end up having sex and neither of us are ready for that. i left a few minutes after. it took a while for everything to settle in, i was kind of in a weird dazed bliss this morning from how much he had complimented me and kissed me but a few hours ago it fully settled in, and now i feel embarrassed and dirty. i cant really talk to him about it today, because its late and ik he needs a break after being with people, but im starting to feel like shit about the whole thing."
Controlling parents,"So, there’s quite a bit!
(M17)

To start for past two years I’ve been wanting to dye my hair but my parents control my life and their opinion or choice basically stones anything I have plans of doing. For example with dying my hair my mom started saying she didn’t care but my dad still says my head will get shaved if it doesn’t look good. I’m not allowed to grow my hair to my preferred length and he says “only girls dye their hair”. It definitely makes me double think everything I wish to do currently. And I hold out a lot of my issues or desires from them because a lot of the time it’s downed or joked about. I hide a lot of stuff because I only have one person in my life who I can open up to, none of which are my parents or family. 

I wanna get out of my comfort zone and try new things but my parents ultimately control what I do. I’ve brought up the fact that I wanted to move out and my mom said she’d report me as missing/stolen. 

I’m not a awful kids though my grades aren’t the best. They’re proudest during football season because I’m good and stuff but they don’t acknowledge my obvious signs of depression. They believe all because I smile and act stupid that I’m fine. When I do it cause when I do act myself people ask questions and I don’t trust opening to anyone because I’ve had it held against me before. When I’m 18 I’m trying to decide what I do, move out to a friends and finish school, or wait until schools over and move away. I don’t want to live near family there’s not a lot of good memories behind it.

Anyone going through same thing? Like starting to test their limits and opening up more? How’s it going what are some little tips to get it to work better..."

And like my other friend told me to break it to her in the nicest way possible but like I fall short when it comes to being nice and now I don’t know what to do"

"Don't know what to do from here, HELP!!!!","Ever since I was little like 4ish years old I felt like my parents were starting to abuse my sister and I. Like it was only from time to time and it was also during a time where my father was becoming successful. As years went on I found that my parents would shake, hit, and yell at my sister and I whenever we made small mistakes. We would sometimes get bigger punishments if we made bigger mistakes. I remember one situation when I was about 5-6, my sister forgot a iPad in an airplane and we realized this when we were home. My dad said he would pick it up but he was angry. The next day during breakfast I forgot what was going on because I was focused on counting the cereal in my bowl but my mom kicked one of the legs on my sisters chair causing her to fall backwards. She stood up and started screaming at me. I immedientley froze, my vision blurred, and the words she was screaming just sounded muffled. However, I was scared to death. We went to school and when our mom picked us up she apologized. The same behavior went on and then when I reached 2nd grade everything changed. My parents got a divorce. I remember my dad walked into my room and asked me, ""Would you be mad if I left for a little bit came back?"" I figured that if he left for a little bit that meant it would just be a couple hours, I thought he was just gonna go to work. He left the room, packed his bags, and I didn't see him for a couple months. After a couple days, I decided that my dad had went on a trip. During those days my mom would forget to feed my sister and I. We kind of just sat in our room and watched minecraft videos or whatever. After, more days passed we would hear our mom crying. Sometimes she would get up storm into our room and yell at us saying that the divorce was our fault. When I finally saw my dad he took us to a party. It was somewhere in Beverly Hills. Full of rich Hollywood people with 20 year old wives. He had got his own too, a girlfriend who was about 13 years younger than him. It upset me that my dad moved on so fast and at first he didn't even tell me that he was dating her. Until like 5 months later when I asked if they were dating. He never even told me they got married. For the next couple of years my mom would talk about how my dad is going to abandon my sister and I and start another family. I heard those words constantly and my mom saying she was the only one who we actually had. When we did visit our dad, every other weekend. It would usually be him talking about how our mom was crazy and him just yelling at us at the top of his lungs. He even showed us his divorce records and whatever and told us our mom said he was physically and emotionally abusive. He told us she lied, I didn't believe it though. My dad has always been a violent person. Last year, I kind of got fed up with my dad and the way he treated me and lied, so I called CPS. I stayed at my mom's house. My mom is a caring person but she sometimes confuses me. Whenever I make a mistake she tells me she's going to drive me straight to my dad's house and drop me off there, she yells insults saying I'm a liar, terrible daughter, a bad kid, how she sometimes wished I was dead, and etc. She occasionally will physically abuse me and when she does it can get pretty scary. I got diagnosed with severe depression and severe anxiety and I have kind of used drugs to help me escape, which I know is unhealthy. I have an amazing social life and friends I love, but my mom rarely lets me have plans. I feel so alone, I have zero trust for any of my parents. I trust my sister but she's usually on her computer or at my dad's. I've had suicidal thoughts but I know I wouldn't do that, the thought of what happens after scares me. Staying at my mom's house is really tiring but I'd much rather stay here than my dad's. Me staying at my mom's means I get blamed for everything, go through constant emotional and mental abuse, and will sometimes be physically abused. My mom doesn't realise her mistakes, refuses to admit her abusive behavior, and we always get in fights. I don't know what to do, I've considered running away but I don't know if it's worth it. I love all my friends and I do still care about my mom. I won't ever forgive her or forget what she did and still does do but she has helped me in so many ways. She helped me find a place to stay after I called CPS on my dad and had nowhere to stay since she was in NY for a bit with my sister. She cares about my health and everything. I just don't really know how I feel about her. I just know the place I'm at right now just makes me miserable. I've tried antidepressants and therapy and both didn't work. I just keep feeling like I'm getting worse. I know I have a good life, I have a good education, a roof over my head, clothes, food, and other basic needs. I just feel like hearing all those words and insults at a super young age really traumatized me and whenever I hear it again from my mom or Dad I freak out. Whenever I look at my mom I just feel unsafe and mad. Both of my parents didn't really make an effort to be emotionally here for my sister and I and both didn't really want to help us with making food or teaching us important life lessons. I kind of grew up feeling like I was more independent than a lot of other people that I personally know my age. I was always kind of jealous of people who could depend on their parents. I've tried talking about how I feel with my mom and she just yells at me and tries to convince me that I'm crazy and how I should be normal. I feel like I can't keep living the way I do. I have no one to talk to and I am so depressed.

Is running away worth it? Should I get an emancipation? Where would I even go if I ran away? Will I feel even more alone? Will my depresssion get worse or better? I really don't know. This is just me being completely honest please just let me know what you think."
This might be weird but......,"How do you get your crush to notice you??? I meet him in school and he is just one grade level below me. We were in the same gym class and we were a group that is how I meet him. We talk and do jokes and I started to like him. At the end of school I gave him my phone number had the confidence and we do text once a while. We also work in the same place and I see him there too though we work different departments. I really like him but I’m too shy and scare to get rejected many people have told me to go ask him but I have social anxiety so it does not help just want some advice if there is a way he might notice me or see that I have interest in him 
Thanks :)"
I feel stupid for even asking this lol,"I don’t use Reddit that much, so i don’t even know if this is the right place to post it, but this is a small sub, so I’m pretty confident that no one will find this. Anyways:
I dated this guy for a short period of time (not even a full year) but we were really close friends prior to our dating.  I was absolutely in love with him, and I would say he was definitely my best friend. And he felt the same, or at least he said he did. But I completely fucked it up. I have a lot that is wrong with me, extreme depression and anxiety, abandonment issues , borderline personality disorder, you know the type. And this caused me to be really distant and confusing in our relationship. No matter how much I told myself that he loved me, my brain told me that I could never be loved. Even though i knew that he only had feelings for me, i was extremely, extremely jealous of everyone he talked to, not just girls, all of his friends, boys included.Thats not to say he was a saint, but I’m almost positive that most of our problems stemmed from my insecurities. But I can genuinely say that i was in the worst place when we dated. But now im not. And neither is he. And i feel like an absolute fool for wasting my chance with the guy of my dreams. Im on better meds now, going to therapy, and just trying really hard to love myself. I am going across the country for the entirety of my summer vacation, and i plan to continue to work on myself in a superficial way ya know, just like losing weight, stuff that will make me more comfortable and confident in my body. So i guess here’s the question: would it be stupid of me to ask to reconnect with him when i come back from vacation. We’ve been broken up for awhile, and there’s still a lot of time for growth between now and when i plan on asking him. Idk, i just really miss him. We’ve both grown a lot and I want another chance...is that stupid?

TLDR i guess; should i ask to reconnect with my ex?"
I feel like my parents are disgusted by me...,"For the past couple of years I feel like I’m a nuisance to my parents...

They say they really love me and don’t want anything to happen to me one day, but the next they just treat me like I’m being a bother. I’m scared to make a mistake around them because if I do they’ll snap and start yelling at me. I remember the last time I made a huge mistake they told me to get out of their house and live on the streets... They said that I’m nothing without their support... I’m scared to talk to them, to ask them for anything... I feel like I’m just being so selfish. It’s not like they’ve ever hit me or anything, and I’m lucky to not be in that kind of situation, but I still don’t know if I can handle being treated like a monster... I know, it’s selfish and I’m being ungrateful but I just wanted to let this out... 

They always see me on my computer ( usually doing productive things like art, homework,etc. but they don’t know that...) and begin yelling at me for it and saying I’m a lazy, spoiled brat. they’re not wrong I suppose... but I still get hurt by their words... I know I shouldn’t, and I should just stay quiet and be doing things like study and homework, but I’ve already finished those things... so when I go onto my computer after finishing, they just yell at me and say I’m addicted... they say I’m gonna to get brain damage and I’m gonna end up stupid.

My older sister... She gets along so well with them... They love her so much and I’m so glad that they do! I really am! I love my sister as well, and she’s the most amazing person I know. I don’t want to tell her how I feel about how they treat me, she’s already so stressed from high school and I can’t push her to do more...  My parents always yell at me for small things like dropping small bits of food and such. And I completely understand this (I should never waste food) but sometimes I can’t take their constant yelling... and I end up crying. I try to cover my tears, but when they see me cry they just get madder and say that I’m so manipulative for trying to make others feel bad... they’re probably right, I don’t even want to let them know how I feel, because if I do they’ll say I’m being ungrateful and spoiled.

Even if I did tel, them, it wouldn’t matter to them I suppose... I once broke into tears and began crying when they said I was retarded and that I’m horrible. ( I was fairly young at the time, about 9 I suppose ) At the time I was young and immature and I thought it was okay to cry... I locked myself into a closet and started crying loudly... when they came up, they told me to be quiet. I cracked a little, and began pouring out all my thoughts... I told them I was a disappointment, a failure, other depressing things I really don’t want to talk about... What they told me next was something I’ll never forget, 
“Why are you like this? Only god can help you, you sick freak...”
I guess this was when I learned to not cry or show my feelings in front of them... I suppose they were right though... I’m a freak... I’m ungrateful, spoiled, and insane... I feel so bad... why did they have to end up with me? Why did they end up with a freak? I just... don’t know how much more I’ll be able to take... I feel like I’m going to break someday... I’m scared! I’m scared of the day when I finally can’t take it and break apart... 

I just needed some place to let it out I guess... If I made you feel sad or bad, I really sorry... please forgive me... Don’t think about my story any longer!"
Am I a hopeless romantic?,"
My girlfriend of 6 months and I have had a very stressful past month in our relationship. We have been very open and honest with eachother,  and she feels as though she loves me, but not in a romantic way.  She thinks that the spark is gone and we can’t reignite it. I personally, while it is wrong of me to assume what is going on in her mind, think that those is because of her self-esteem issues and her worrying that she has to make me happy (the latter of which we openly discussed, and I have told her that I’m always happy with her, and that she doesn’t need to jump through hoops to please me). She decided it was best if we break things off yesterday, which didn’t surprise me, but hurts nonetheless.  I told her that I would be here for her always. I’ve always been there for her, and I’ve never hurt her in any way. Anyway, I’m asking reddit if there’s anything I can really do to save our relationship, or find the spark. I’m willing to give more information if I haven’t said enough. (TL;DR Guys please just read it)"
Need a good and relatively cheap first date ideas,I am going to ask this girl out on a date but dont really want to go on the movie and dinner first date and would like to stay inside any good ideas?
"what to do with ex girlfriend / bestfriend (long but please read, need advice)","There’s a girl that i’ve been best friends with since the 7th grade. We’re both 16 and are Juniors in high school. As we got older (end of freshmen year / sophomore year) it came to the attention that we were both in love with each other. We tried to have a relationship in sophomore year but it never ended up working out. (We also go to different schools but live about 10 min away from each other) We still remained close friends and we got back together for one week during the beginning of our Junior year, but the thing is that she was talking to Senior at the time. She ended things with me that week because she wanted to “live her teenage years fully” because she always told me that we would get married and have children together when we’re older. They later ended up getting into a relationship that lasted 2 months before she ended things with him because “she was in love with someone else” (indirectly talking about me). But when she told me that, we still never talked as much as we did when we were best friends. (We weren’t “best friends” because she had a boyfriend if that makes sense). I later found out from her friend about a month after she broke up with him that they were back together and she never told me. Even after talking so much shit about him when they broke up. And i really am in love with this girl and never felt about this way about any other girl i’ve ever tried to have a relationship with and i’m not sure what to do. Would it be wrong to ghost her for a little while or should i still text her every so often. She never made a effort to text me after she broke up with him after claiming that it was because she loved me they broke up, so i would only think she would want to talk to me. I feel extremely bad ghosting her but it seems to me that she doesn’t really care too much. 

Sorry if this made little to no sense to anyone reading this. This is just something i’m currently dealing with and i have no one to talk to / get advice from about this situation.

Thanks btw if you read this, ur a real one."
Boy troubles,"How do I take someone out of the friend zone without telling them directly that I like them 


I friend zoned an old friend a couple of years back but now I’m developed a crush now do I tell him without actually telling him if that makes any sense bc I am embarrassed lol 😫😫🤗🤗"
Why I’m I being ghosted?,"I like a guy who gives me the weirdest signs. Here is the list of things he did: he opened up about his past when we barely talked to each other, texted me sweet dreams, asked me about my type, thought that I was into other guys, came up to my desk each day to greet me, looked into my eyes each time I spoke and spread his legs when facing me, his friend bobbing his head my direction leaving him smiling and shaking his head, then ghosted me and only said hey, until winter break and HUGGED ME And wished me a Merry Christmas, then back to being ghosted, sitting next to this really funny kid and my crush would look my way ever so often but still being ghosted atm. HELP ME DOES HE LIKE ME OR NOT??"
Making time for a relationship,"So me and this girl (both freshman) have been hanging out for a while, since a little before Christmas. We both like eachother for sure, but ive been kinda waiting to ask her out because I don't really know how it would work out. I've got daily sports including weekends year round. Afterwards I'm always kinda wrecked so we've only been able to hang out once or twice a week. 

If we start dating, is only hanging out outside of school a couple times a week an ok amount? Would I have to drop some things to make more time?
 
Clearly I'm not the only kid to have daily sports, I'm just inexperienced with all this. Thanks."
Feeling lonely every weekend.,"Hi! so i’m just a normal teenage in a normal high school. But there’s one problem, I feel lonely. especially during weekends. mostly i don’t go out during weekends and just stay at home doing my homework or watching tv or series or any other stuff while trying to talk to my ‘friends’ on social media i guess? and i just noticed that it’s always that goes to my friends and try & start a discussion. But this time, i was like : okay let me test something out. I didn’t talk to any of my friends on social media (almost) i guess and i just wanted to see if they’re gonna send me a message or something and nope none of them did actually, i did sent a message like to 2 people and it’s about some urgent stuff but i was ignored lol also I’m in a small groupchat with my friends and when they were talking i just keep leaving messages on read so maybe they talk to me or ask me what’s wrong or why i’m not answering & talking, but that didn’t happen of course and i swear to god if it was another one than me then they will ask what’s wrong! 
So in conclusion : if i don’t try messaging my friends , it’s either they literally forget about me or they don’t even message me. And this weekend i spent almost the WHOLE weekend alone. the only people i spoke to are either my parents (not that much really like just the normal boring conversations) and some girl who i’m doing a project with and that’s literally it. 
Can i have and advice here?What do i do so i can feel less lonely.?"
I have a situation??,"Long story short, I really like this guy that goes to another school. I’m not allowed to talk to him but have been and we’ve decided that it’s best to just stay friends for right now. I’m not exactly sure how I’m supposed to deal with this?? Everything just feels right with him but my parents disapprove so I’m not sure what I’m going to do. Can anyone help or give advice?"
Help for moving to a new school??,"I’m 16 and a girl. I go to a school in Chicago suburbs w about 3,200 students. Usually I’m pretty outgoing but I have pretty bad anxiety. Next year, I’m moving to Minneapolis and I’m going to a smaller high school there. I’m shadowing there in a few weeks, any tips or advice? I’m really scared that I’ll make a bad impression or people won’t like me."
I cant sleep,About 2 days ago whilst me and my mom wore on the way home from the store her car engine cut out we managed to pull over beside the fast lane my mom told me to climb into the back seat on the side opposite  the road  as we thought it was safer she had me keep look look threw the back window for any cars that get to close to wave them down   but there  was a guy in a van on his phone and he didnt see us until the very last second until he swerved away taking put wing mirror along with him it was so close to a almost fatal crash as this guy was going well over 100 mph but last night when I went to sleep anytime I close my eyes all I can  see is the van coming straight at us it's so scary I don't  no what to do I was honestly fearing for my life for those two hours until the tow truck came I just cant seen to forget about it
Is it weird to contact my long lost childhood best friend?,"This girl and I were best friends when we were around 7-10 years old for a few years. I met her baby sister (who’s birthday is the day before mine) and watched her grow up. She had a grandpa who showed me magic tricks, and who’s dog guarded us, and me and her went rowing with her dad, camped in her backyard, and threw New Years parties singing on table tops. I kind of forgot how good those times are and want to reconnect with her, even though I’m 15 and she’s 16 now. I don’t expect to become best friends with her again but kinda want to DM her. I feel like she’ll think it’s weird and won’t really remember me. Do you think it would be weird to do so?"
"Reddit, I need help.","I haven’t posted here before, but I will, because I really need advice. Sorry for formatting, on mobile.
I am just barely on the spectrum.
Backstory: I’ve written about my mother before. She’s always so calm and fun, but the moment something small goes wrong she’s in a mood. I don’t know if I’m too close to see it or something, but some people have told me she’s gone way too far and not the best parent. 

I’m now in a Brain Balance program, started two weeks ago to help me. I have focus and listening problems, and can never actually think about the choices I make. I’ve gotten better, but this is a three month program that’s barely started. The gist of it is at home I have a set of exercises to do every day, and I do them even though it makes no sense to me. 

Here’s what led up to this problem- last night, in one of my not-thought out responses, I decided I didn’t want to do two out of seven chores. So I just didn’t. And who tells their parent “hey I don’t wanna do this so I’m just gonna walk away” no, everyone covers their tracks. Apparently because I didn’t fold sheets and do the dishes, mother was tipped over the edge.

She woke me up roughly this morning, and yelled at me that I’m doing everything right in front of her for now on, including moving my working station to right next to hers (she works from home and I’m homeschooled now). I could never work well while others were watching me in school, and now she wants to glare at my computer screen all day and judge each step I take to complete my work.

I can’t post pictures on mobile as far as I can see, but these texts happened this morning.

Me: I don’t mean to be rude, but I earned the ability to work in my room and chose to save it. Why am I being forced to work right next to you, just because I decided I didn’t want to do some chores? You know I’m bad at making decisions and thinking things through, that’s why I’m in a class. I’m trying to fix things but 6 days of brain balance won’t fix everything.

Her: We can discuss this in person.

Me: I’d rather do it over text, you know how bad I am at communicating my thoughts in person...

Her: Improving your in-person communicating skills is part of the goal.



I don’t post often to reddit at all, but I really need help here. What should I do?

Edit: we had a “talk”. She had her voice raised the whole time about how I had 5 ———— days to do work last week (It’s the same every week, why is last week special?) and how the chores just broke the camel’s back. Every time I asked for one day to make things up or actually spoke up (being in the spectrum, I have a really hard time saying what I want to), she would full on yell at me. She ended with “go cry into a pillow or whatever but this is how it’s gonna work. It’s called tough love... nevermind, not going to go there, it’s just offensive and will make you ugly cry more.”

I’m actually considering going for a walk with my phone tracker off for an hour or two. What should I do?"
How to get rid of an unwanted friend?,"I'll try to keep this short but there is a lot to say.

There's this boy (we'll call him Jake), who hangs out with me and my friends everyday. However, I really don't like Jake at all. Although my friends don't really understand it (well they feel bad for him so they choose to ignore it), I see what he's really like. He's mouthy, incredibly rude, kills all our conversations/jokes, extremely nosy, makes ""jokes"" about things we're very insecure about, has no filter, always tries to bring me down, etc and he doesn't even try to hide it. He's only started hanging out with us recently (say, for the last few months) but me and my friends have been together since middle school and Jake is really ruining our dynamic. I wish he would leave but every time I mention it, my friends take his side and tell me not to start something. I've tried to talk to them, especially Jake, about it but they say it's not worth it but it's ruining my favourite part of school (hanging out with my friends), so why shouldn't I get to have a say on that? I can't just walk away from my group as an ultimatum because although I do have other friends, they've got their own group dynamics and besides, why should \*I\* have to leave \*my\* best friends for someone they don't like that much either? I'm pretty sure he has at least a few other friends so I don't see why he wants to hang out with us when all we do is argue.

I hope this all makes sense and any advice on how to approach this would be helpful, thanks."
My Gf doesn’t treat me right,Ok so ive been dating her for almost 2 years now and she has been treating me like shit recently. She always ignores my texts and whenever i try and talk to her she makes it seem like she is not interested anymore. Not only does it hurt my feelings but it makes me worried that she is going to break up with me. Ive tried to take her out but she always refuses and she honestly doesn’t care about my feelings anymore. Not only that her friends were telling me she was texting a guy for 3 hours straight and i talked to her about it and she no to everything. I honestly dont know what to do one day she actually made me cry a little because she said she doesnt want to talk to me for the whole day. Im not so good when it comes to feelings im a very sensitive guy but i can hide my feelings super well i dont know how. Please tell me what i can do to make her happy again i dont k know whats wrong with her i really dont want to break up with her or her cheating on me. Please tell me im desperate

How do I cure my social awkwardness?,"So ever since I was little, I got bullied and was pretty isolated from others. I was able to make a few friends, but it was only in school. My parents never let me go over to any friends house, hang out after school, or really talk to anyone (outside of school via things like texting n social media). 

Even now when I have access to social media n stuff, I can never get myself to even say hi to anyone. In situations when I'm around new people or not really close with anyone around me, I tend to just be on my own out of habit. The few times I've been able to muster up some courage, I can never carry on a conversation or say anything that would want them to talk with me more or be my friend. 

Even if there is people I really want to talk to and have good conversations with them, I freeze up and assume the worse case scenario, and I dont want them to think of me as a weirdo and I simply dont do anything. 

Anyone know how to help?"
Need help with life/love,"So, im a 15 y.o. male. I've always been a little ""down""/depressed (dunno), and I feel like i'm a little too careless about family, friends, etc, though i love to be with my friends. I don't know if this is a little over -estimated of me, but i think that despite being like that i may be a too much altruistic.

 So, some months ago, there was this girl in my class, and we've been friends for some time. One day, some dramatic things happnened and I fell in love with her. Like, i'm not even joking, it wasn't a crush, obsessive crush neither, i straight fell in love. I felt like i never loved anything like her in my whole life. Okay, some things happened, i discovered that in the end (at least with relationships matter) i am really careful and loving, and we ended up dating. So, everything was going fine, after some time she started acting a little strange, and after 2 months she broke up with me.

I just broke down, i didn't know what to think or what to do. Did I do something wrong? She was the one with problems? and i'm a very, very sentimental person, so this was really hard for me to accept as she literally was my world. 

Some time passed since then, and now's the real problem: I fear that I might end up living alone the rest of my life. Some time ago I started to think a little, and this is a little hard for me to explain, but I feel like I will never find someone for me. It feels like i'm a little disappointed with people today. Everyone's feelings seem so superficial, like everybody just wants to ""fuck""/ have sexual experiences, I know a lot of people and I dont know anyone who isn't like that.

I just want someone who really loves me as much as I loved her, but for some reason that seems impossible to find. Every person i see on the streets seem at the same time ""mean"" and ""superficial"" in that way I described. Maybe i'm just delusional and nobody is like that. I mean, I obviously want to have these kinds of things, i'm human too, but i feel like nobody have true feelings for other people. Maybe I am right, and people are not the way I expected them to be, and unfortunately, that seems even more true in the country I live, as people here are really ""sexualized"". Maybe people have true feelings but i'm just a boring person, despite my efforts to be someone fun and ""great"" to be with.

I don't know why, but at the same time I feel like it will be really hard for me to fall for someone again as I look down on people that much. 

Summarizing, I feel like the kind of people I like (people just like me, really caring and care-needing) do not exist anymore, and I will never fall/have interest for anyone for the rest of my life, and me being this really sentimental person I am, living the rest of my life like that is impossible. I know that i'm too young for this but it feels like, in the sense of relationships, I'm a really mature person, in the sense that I want a really serious relation.

Also, that girl showed me a part of life I never knew, she kind of remembered me how feeling happy is, because I haven't felt that kind of happiness that you can physically feel in years. In fact, I haven't felt any kind of happiness for a really long time, and know that she is gone, there is something missing.

TL;DR : I basically think i will spend the rest of my life alone because I will never have any kind of interest in people as I think people today are not the kind of people i really like, which are really caring and loving people. As I am a really sentimental person that loves that feeling of real love, not any crush, it is impossible for me to live alone after my ex-gf, someone i loved more than the whole world left me, leaving some kind of ""void"". 

I hope to find someone that feels the same as me or either is someone like me in the sense of being both really care-needing and care-giving, so that I know I'm not correctly hopeless. I know that this issue may seem really kind of ""dumb"" for most people, but it is destroying me as I need someone in order to live happily. Thanks for reading"
Love... its complicated,"So me and this guy met through a friend. Lesta call my friend Maria and let's name him John. Maria and a couple of girlfriend were going out, when a big part of the canceled plans. So Maria and me decided to postpone it, when later she called me telling me that she would be going out with a couple of her friends, and invited me. 

I agreed and off we went. I was introduced to John. MAN DID I FALL FOR HIM. As cliche as it might sound, we clearly made a click. He is just so sweet and attentive and just wow. By the time, he had something going one with this other girl, lesta call her anne, but stuff want working for them and they were breaking it off. 

So we met and it was nice, we chatted for hours like if we had been friends for years. We exchanged numbers and everything was great.  Me being me, I decided to make my move when I thought Anne and him were over, a couple of weeks passed and he hadn't talked about her, so I assumed they were over. 

We CLEARLY flirted back and forth, he started calling me sweet names and became veeery sweet with me, I obviously showed the affection back. And so a couple of days ago, we were talking on the phone when I asked him about Anne. 

Well, little did I know that THEY HAD BEEN DATING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS FROM THEN and he didnt tell me! Like, he knew we had something going on, and like I wouldn't be mad to keep him as a friend. 

I like him so much, that i would gladly accept friendship, I care about his happiness. And since we flirted, we opened up to each other and stuff, it did hurt a little when I got the news. Well, he now knows that I know about their relationship. 

When out of nowhere, he sent me something about being me really hot and stuff, complimenting me and I dont even know now. 

I'm in a weird position at the moment, I dont know how to feel or do. Like I said, I dont mind him as a friend, I just want to be in his life (not force myself into it obviously) but I just want his happiness. 

Maria (our friend) decided to invite me to go out with another guy friend and another girl friend, when out of the boom she is like ""oh, and John is comming"" when I already accepted the invitation. 

I really want to see my friends but my feelings are mixed about him. We will be going out on Sunday, so I've got this week. 

What should i do?"
Could really use some advice!,"I'm a 16 year old male and I have fallen in love with this girl (she is a German exchange student who will leave in a year), she is very smart and really quite beautiful, but one of my best friends is also interested in her. He doesn't know that I have a crush and things seem to be moving pretty fast between them. I really like the guy he is a real genuine nice person but it's so crushing seeing them together, how he makes her laugh and smile and how I know that I could never do that ( I have tried so many times but it always comes off as awkward).

Maybe even worse is that it even seems that the majority of my friends (who aren't even trying) are closer to her than I am and in conversations it seems like I am just left behind and a bit ignored. I am frustrated with myself because I have had so many opportunities to make her smile, I take the exact same subjects as she does (by coincidence) and sit next or close to her in 2 of them, but it almost never works. I have even started learning German to have something to talk about with her (it's going surprisingly well) but hasn't really helped much aside from once or twice. it just feels so pointless to try."
Really need some help here,I have recently learned that the girl I like has a crush on me so I have decided to tell her when we get back to school after the long weekend but I just really don’t know how DM me for more details if you need them
Is it going to be considered “gay” to have a pair of Lululemon womens leggings?,"I’m not trying to say that being gay is bad. I don’t have an opinion, but gender and identity really matter to me.

Neighbor wars,"I am a college student with horrible neighbors. There was literally one single occasion where I said “can you please stop yelling” when they were screaming in the hallway at night and since then, it has been war. They have taped pictures on our windows, put water outside our door, banged on our door at almost midnight, kicked our door, etc. Their favorite thing to do is slam their door so hard it shakes our kitchen.

Best Friend Secretly With My Ex?😞,"So , i’m going through a akward breakup right now. See my ex boyfriend was in a difficult relationship and i was kind of like his guide to help him get through. You know the story..we got together😂. The first month or so was AMAZING. We would fall asleep on FaceTime together talking about anything, sharing our insecurities,etc. I guess I ignored the signs he kind of liked my friend.. he kind of ghosted me for 4 days. So me and my best friend set him up! He was answering NONE of my calls, so an hour later she came over and called him, he answered within seconds. Didn’t even answer my texts asking if everything’s alright, nope, left opened. She told him to call me because I was worried. His answer? “Why.” I broke down right there. I then broke up with him and had some excuses but i had enough. things went into an off and on relationship but, overall it was over. I did my retail therapy and got over it. Then, I see his name on the top of her snapchat a lot..not wierd right? How about when I tell you she shows me a strong majority of her snapchat messages without it even being my concern or business but if he texts she’s quick to not open it until I’m out of sight..I don’t want to seem controlling OR clingy. But, something just seems up...any ideas or tips? I could use it. Eh, back to retail therapy. Maybe I should let it be,I feel so annoying right now.."
I feel like my friends are too good for me,"My friends are the nicest people in the world. I haven't been the nicest person in my past, I dont really know how to deal with it. I feel like they would be better without me"
Lonely and frustrated,"Everyone in my friend group has recently got into relationships and we spend less time together and when we do all they talk about is how great their relationship are and keep insisting i should get a girlfriend.

Im a reserved person who doesn't really go out of their way to talk to people im not shy im just lazy and only have so much social energy i can spend on people and because of this my social skills are the best plus im not drop dead gorgeous (yet) so my personality is gonna have carry me to the promised land to bad i have the personality f a brick wall. If you search up approach in the dictionary a picture of will show up most definitely 

Girls arent really attracted to me and the only one that was crazy and threatened to lock my in her basement and keep me as a sex slave for refusing to go out with her

When it comes to picking up chick i dont know what im doing I dont know how to flirt, smooth talk or show someone im intrested in them. i dont have any motivation to look for a relationship but a still cant help but feel lonely sometimes in the friend group im tye only virgin left and there is a runnings hashtag in pur groupchat with i find hilarious #GetCamCoochie2020 and joking poke fun at me for being a lightskin that doesn't know how to lightskin the jokes dont bother me

Im mostly mad at myself for procrastinating social skills in grade school ive been teying my best to improve them but im not a player levels of charisma yet."
How can I be happy for other people? :(,"So I wasn’t exposed to a lot as a child as far as support from my parents and encouragement goes. They say they were there for me when it came to my passions and interests but they never actually were. I’ve missed out on a lot of my life because of myself and also because of their discouragement. Until recently I never thought I was capable of learning the things I wanted to learn or doing the things I wanted to do; I was isolated and in online school with no friends or socialization. I’m in public school now and I’m finding it difficult being happy for other people especially my friends. I’m accidentally envious towards them and I don’t mean to be, how can I change this behavior tho? For example, a lot of them are really into music. I am too, I’m a sound engineer but I don’t know how to play any instruments and when they talk about playing and performing I get really upset even if I try to stop myself from getting upset. It still upsets me, I think it’s because I wish I had that skill and I’m working on it, but it’s not something I’m capable of doing in the same way right now. Any advice? It’s just jealousy in general, like they’ve all known each other since they were little and I’m just kind of here. It’s getting better but it’s also getting worse."
How do I tell my mom to stop asking about times?,"whenever i have to do homework or anything time consuming, my mom always asks how long it will take, how much longer, etc. 

it's really grating on my nerves and i keep telling her ""i don't know"" because i really don't. it could take 30 minutes to 5 hours honestly. whenever i tell her i don't know, she always replies with ""that's not good enough, tell me a time. guess."" but if i tell her it will take an hour and it takes more than that, she gets really upset. or if i say something like 4 hours (which is way in the realm of possibility with the classes i'm taking) she also gets upset because she says that's too long. 

it's almost become a cat and mouse game like this, and i'm so tired of it. i tried talking to her about it but she dismissed it and keeps doing it. 

what should i do??"
I need help,I am a 4 foot 10 inches 7 grader who loves basketball. I think I am too short to play because I get blocked every time. I am going to quit basketball soon because of this. I do not want to quit but the game is not as fun as I used to play it. I started basketball 7 years ago and it has been my favorite sport. What should I do
"Broke up with my ex two years ago, still miss our relationship","I am now 18 , she is the same age.

Broke up with my ex 2 years ago, still miss our intimacy and love

Broke up with my ex, but miss the times we had

About 2 years ago I dated a girl in my senior year of high school. I had met her in a wood shop class and we really hit it off. I am a very shy person so dating and being a couple wasn’t my thing really. We got together and instantly everyone started looking at me different because I had gotten with her. Like I said, I was very shy and wasn’t “up” on the drama around the school. She had apparently been the biggest slut in school and had dated and had slept with a lot of guys.

But I didn’t see this at all, maybe because I was so in love for the first time in my life or that I didn’t want to believe it but I don’t know. Our relationship lasted about 4 months and in that time we had sex and she took my virginity. Eventually, the talks around school about me and what I was doing got to me. I was very insecure about going out with her and slowly I decided to break up with her. The way I did it was kind of shitty but I didn’t know how to properly break up with a girl seeing as this was my first serious relationship. She had gotten me upset about something and instead of forgive and forget like I usually would have I made a big deal out of it and stayed mad at her for a few days, thought because she wasn’t around me but I was still with her that people would look at me different but that’s not wha happened. Everyone still treated me the same until I cut her off and blocked on everything.

2 years later, I haven’t spoken to her and I am in a relationship. I still think back to our times together and how that relationship felt different than this one. Me and my ex were much more sexual and physically in love than my current. Don’t get me wrong , me and my current girlfriend do get touchy, but it’s not as often and not as passionate as with my ex. 

My question is, is this bad to be feeling this way? My current girlfriend knows of my ex and has told me multiple times how much of a slut she was, but I can’t help feeling that i saw a different side of her when it was just me and her either out and about doing things or having sex, it was something I couldn’t describe. The things she did were true and there was evidence for what she did, but for some reason it didn’t matter to me.

TL:DR: broke up with my ex because of how I was looked at with her, and miss our physical love.


Edit : me and my girlfriend broke up a few months ago and I’ve been single since. Few girls here and there but no relationships. Just can’t do it right now"
How do I help a friend,"So yesterday morning I was rald that my friend's dad passed away by a heart attack. My friend and her mom are currently in their home town. 

(Take in account that we havent talked alot recently, since school and drama always got on our ways.) 

I have no clue in what to say to her

What should I do?"
Failing school,"my mom is sending me to a private school and sacrifices a lot to do so. i am failing all of classes right now and I have no idea how to tell her. i know i HAVE to break the news to her soon bc  a staff member sent an email home abt two weeks ago asking to have a meeting and somehow she hasnt seen it yet. Once she finds out she’ll probably un-enroll me so if you could offer advice on how to transition to a new school w. a very different atmosphere it would be helpful. This “new” school is much bigger, the kids are (generally) more hostile and im a socially awkward person who has a very difficult time making friends (I’ve been going to my current school which is very small for two years now and I havent made a single friend lol). It is also significantly more academic and I struggle greatly with academics...anyways thanks for reading"
Should I talk to him???,"(I'm 17 and female). At school I have a group of friends, we are ten. So there's this guy that I've always had issues with. We have strong characters and our jokes can get a little insulting...

The point is that we don't have the best relationship and he texted me a week ago that he wanted to arrange a day to go out or call each other to talk about everything and try to get along better. The problem is that he didn't contact me again (he said we could talk last week) and I don't know if he wants me to take the next step (because he took the initiative) or he just decided to let it go or forgot about it. I'm very insecure so I don't want to bother him but have no idea what's the right thing to do (even though I think we should stop being so mean to each other). Maybe it's not necessary to talk about it(?"
"Sooooooo I went on a date with the teacher’s son and he felt me up, turns out he was acting as if I was his old gf","Backstory(kinda boring tbh):

So I met this guy while I was on a school trip and his mum(who is a teacher and is really sweet) brought him along. I developed a crush on him and we both had a crush on each other until I ghosted him for a month(at this point we had been talking for 4 months via text and hadn’t met up since the school trip) then we both lost those feelings). We then talked for 9 months until we actually met up irl.

So now I had talked to him for over a year at this point. My friends then shipped us and on NYE my friend Milly pranked him by telling him that I liked him I liked him(she stole my phone), but then he said he liked me too. Turns out Millie was texting him privately telling him to say that and he didn’t know it was a prank. But I went along with the prank pretending saying I liked him(lying). But then he still said he liked me, so I convinced myself that I liked him(which I now know I don’t). I said I wanted to think about if I wanted to date him bc I knew he was kinda a player.


ACTUAL STORY:

So the teacher’s son(who I had been texting for a year and had met up with 4 times) asked me to go to the movies AS FRIENDS so I said sure. We got food before and he put his arm around me a couple times but let go quickly, obviously nervous.

When we got there he put his hand on my thigh and I acted as if I didn’t notice. Once the movie started I put my hand near his and he grabbed it and held it. Then he put his arms around me and put his head on my shoulder, eventually he started lightly kissing(and I mean I couldn’t even feel it I thought it was an accident) my neck, hair and shoulder. I was trying to lean away from him(so his head wasn’t resting on my shoulder) but he had his arm around me so I couldn’t.

I went to the bathroom to freak out to my friends. When I came back I grabbed his hand and held it. He started rubbing my thigh, slowly inching up and kissing my shoulder leaning his head on my shoulder for a second and then sitting back up. His hand got really close to my crotch and I tensed up, he noticed and stopped about 2 inches away from my crotch(*). Then leaving the theatre I grabbed his hand and held it. He was fully aware I had never dated anyone before so I thought this was normal first date things. 

After I wanted to know what he was thinking so I texted him and he replied(his old Gf is called Chloe)
“Idk I basically acted like I acted when I was with Chloe and when I realised that in fact you are not Chloe and that you are different it was too late but by then you had reciprocated and then I just went with it”

So I acted like he didn’t just say that and went along with it, until I told him I didn’t want to be a rebound, he said I wasn’t but he knew why I would think that. I basically just went off on his and we argued for another hour. Then after all that we both kept saying “we can just be friends if you want” and then I eventually said that and he replied “ok gn” and I said “goodbye and sorry”. I eventually apologised(**). 

Aftermath:
I cried a couple tears because I didn’t want to stop dating him, but then I realised I didn’t really like him, or maybe I do? I’m not really sure tbh. He still likes me and thinks I like him. I’m keeping up with this whole ‘just being friends’ with him and it’s going really well.

WHAT I NEED ADVICE ON:
So now what? Do I tell him? Keep him thinking I like him just incase I change my mind? Do I like him? I NEED HELP




* He actually ended up apologised for that after via text and I said it was fine but he said he was really sorry

** I said “Look, I’m really sorry about yesterday. I wasn’t really angry at you thinking I was Chloe or whatever I was more upset that I reciprocated and you didn’t want that. One of my friends says that I tend to ‘deflect my problems into other people’ or ‘blame myself for things that aren’t my fault’ so I think that’s what just happened. Sorry. Also I’m off my pill and it’s shark week so I’m incredibly impulsive and all of my emotions are revved up, complete with mood swings. I know it’s not really an excuse but just thought it was relevant information.”"
How to get my gf off drugs,So my gf has been hitting puffs which is nicotine and wax pens for about 2 months and i do it as well but i told her if she wants me to stop ill stop immediately but she never tells me that and ive been trying to tell her we should stop but she never really listens to me i love her so much and wouldnt leave her but its starting to worry me that shes becoming obsessed what can i do im in need for help
Help...,"I'm turning 15, my entire life has been with my parents due to me being the youngest by 7 years in my family. So it has always been just me and my parents because my siblings are always off somewhere else. I was just informed 2 days ago there getting a divorce. I have never considered them getting a divorce. So I'm wondering if anyone has been in a similar position. If so how did you walk through it. Or what helped to get through."
So ido what to say,"My best guy friend fell for this girl who is also a friend of mine. Shit got complicated and she dumped him, when he reaaaally reaaaally liked her, fell for her. I have no clue in what to say to him, advice?"
"Forced to disconnect from two good friends, I don't know how to reconnect","I apologise if my English isn't great. 

I have two great online friends. I've known them for a good five years and we've called and texted each other a lot, so naturally I trust them. 
Problem is, my mom doesn't. 
She caught me texting them one night, and the following morning she woke up early, took my phone, and read our conversations. (she does not allow passwords)
She didn't like a lot of things about them, nor did she like the conversations which we had (to be fair, we did use a bit of profanity) Next thing I know, I'm cutting every single contact I have with them. I wasn't even able to tell them what happened, she just wanted them gone and out of my life. 
It's been a while since then, but I've been very sad. They helped me through a lot of stuff in the past, and I had plans to meet them in a few years as well, so it's been very hard to let go. 

Should I continue to let go of them, or should I convince my mom that they're both nice people? I really want to talk to them again, since they were basically there when I had nobody else.
Even if I do decide to convince her, I have no idea how. She's worried about me, and I understand that. but I don't know how to make her feel otherwise about them."
How can I get off as a trans guy,I really don’t like using the shower head and I’m not all that sensitive down there so I don’t really know what to do about it I do anal and I can’t actually do anything with my other hole and I’m not sure if I’d actually enjoy it
Am I doing something wrong ?,So I’m currently in a relationship and I’m so happy. But there’s one problem I feel like I make him upset a lot. Idk if it’s because I tend to over think a lot or he over thinks but I just keep making him upset and it hurts me to see him so upset. I wanna know if I should do something and if so what is that something?
I think my dad walked in on me master baiting,"The other day I was lying in bed, jerking off when suddenly my dad opened the door without knocking. I threw the blanket over myself and asked what’s up, I forget what he said but it is not important to the story. I’m not sure if he actually saw anything or not but I’m really hoping he didn’t. Please dint give me any of this “Talk to him” BS Because me anxiety would never let me even think about actually doing that. Not sure exactly what kind of advice I’m looking for, just something to calm me a little, I guess."
I FaceTimed a girl too young for me and my friends found out,I am in 10th grade and I talked to an 8th grader for a few days. Sometimes we had her friend on there and we would talk. That friend decided to send a picture of us to my group of friends and they made fun of me and probably have sent it to other people. How can I get over this?
I just need advice,"okay I'm not sure how to start this off  but I'll give you a background. I've been feeling off lately. Back around the end of 2017 like in mid September and through august of 2018 I was in an episode of sadness. (Im not going to call it a depressive episode because I was not diagnosed with depression or anything of the sort.) I didn't recieve any help throughout the time and just bottled up everything and covered it up with a goofy personality I created. I tried to discuss it with adults in my life but they shook it off saying I was going through a phase and that it will go away as time goes. Now Ive been realizing changes that I haven't noticed that began around july of this year. I've been unmotivated to do anything, All the love and passion I had for certain activities went away. It's hard for me to remember any joy or pleasure I had. Through the small period of August of 2018 till July of 2019 I had burst of high energy (like in small episode 1-2 weeks every other week). And at this point I'm just confused. 

I'm not sure if I should talk to my doctor about this problem if I do I just have an underlying concern or worry that they'll contact CPS. (we've had trouble in the past with them but it wasn't anything major but it was scary.) I'm just confused on what to do next.

p.s. I haven't talked to anyone indepth about what I went through. I don't think I can trust my friends about my struggles and prefer to keep them out of my problem to not bother them. I'm sorry"
What do I do?,"I’m 15 and male, just realized about an hour ago I have a cold sore on my lip (HSV-1). I’ve know for a while that there was a good chance this was going to happen because I found out that a girl that I had more than friendly contact with had it, but I only found out afterwards. So here I am at 15 with fucking oral herpes. I’m at a loss for words because my sex drive is crazy so my friends have been calling me a man whore for years already and this, this is gonna make that all too real. I feel so powerless knowing that I fucked up and there’s nothing I can do to fix it. The only thing now is I really do like that girl and if we can keep it going between us then things will be ok I guess. If you were in my situation what would you do?"
I need help deciding if my parents are strict or not.,"**Trigger warning: Mentions of self harm.**

Hello. My name is Moon.
I am a 15 year old (F) raised under a strict (?) household.

My parents do not know i have reddit. This is the place where i can let all my troubles because i trust people on the internet more then my own parents.

I’ll be talking as if i am confronting my parents.

1) Mom and Dad, i know about your porn account and what you do. You have lied to me saying it’s a service for online shopping. I know your login. I have screenshots of you and Dad sexting complete strangers on the internet. I have seen you take nudes and send them to people. You pay for this service, but i don’t know how much. I have dozens of screenshots that i’ve sent to myself of you chatting with these people. I want to tell someone about this, i do.

2) I dislike it when you scream/scold at me for simple reasons. You end up hitting me because of it, and meanwhile, i’m left there crying. I try my best to relate to you, but no matter how, you won’t listen. I don’t know what to do at this point, so i take it all in.

3) That one time i was in the shower, i was crying because you were telling me i was ungrateful and that i was the reason why my pet bird died. You were drunk with your friends and kicked her and didn’t help her. I don’t like you for this. I remember calling you asking if she was okay, and you said yes.

4) I was mentally and emotionally abused by my ex-girlfriend back in 8th grade. She used to tell me i was worthless, i wasn’t trying, and that i was ugly. 

5) Because of that, i started to self harm. I cut my thighs a lot, and simply say that it’s just bad stretch marks.

6) I don’t feel like i have any privacy. You go through my phone countless times, through my contacts and apps.

7) You don’t know i have discord.

8) I am dating someone named Otto. (M) We met on discord and grew to like eachother, we know how we look like, we know how we sound like. We have made an agreement of boundaries to respect eachother and when we need personal space. He lived is Kansas, and i like in Texas.

9) I don’t know if i have depression or anxiety. I am friends with someone from Texas A&M, his name is Dylan. He is studying for a major in psychology and he has told me i probably have depression.

10) When i was in 7th grade, i used to go to Dylan so tell all my problems to. He was there when you never gave me the physical and emotional attention. He was the one who gifted me the moon necklace for my birthday, not my friends. I called him a ‘secondary’ parent. You don’t know his girlfriend took her own life, and that his mother also died. 

I want to tell my parents about this, but i don’t know how. Every time i try to tell them calmly and with kindness, they proceed to scold me for my actions, calling me useless and ungrateful. I have to take care of two cats, two dogs, and i do most of the stuff for you since you are busy fucking in the bedroom. I do your taxes. I keep count of your things, things you can do yourself. You are almost 50. I don’t think grandma and grandpa would like this."
Best friend second guesses,I am struggling with anxiety and my best friend has been with me all the way but lately we haven’t been speaking. I have asked her time and time again if she wants to stay over but she always cancelles last minute. I am starting to get the feeling that she doesn’t like me anymore and I being stupid or not please I want honest answers
I really like this girl but she already said she don’t like me but her actions during the day says different and I don’t know what to do,"I’m starting off high school and I meet this one girl who was friends with my other friend. I’ve been talking to the girl who I have a crush on for almost a month straight like none stop and just having fun and playing around even during the school day. I was the only person she really let into her life fast and so deep. So one night me and her was on FaceTime talking and I told her I like her and she already knew bc of how obvious I was. She told me some things like “I don’t wanna date you because I just don’t wanna be known as just one of your highschool girlfriends and I don’t want a friendship that could last years to end in months” I honestly completely understood that but she knows that I’m not that type of guy and I would wanna keep a relationship for ever and soon maybe marry (aka even tho it’s a young age I’m dating someone to marry down the road)  and sorta backed away from showing any affection but then I sometime still do. Me and her still talking and fooling around but then I found out her mom wants me over for dinner, I never talked to her mom or anything so she must have been talking to her mom about me right? And then there’s the goofiness with the times me and her hang out. When we hang out we act like total crack heads and can’t stop smiling and laughing and just how she would lay on my shoulder and just seem so comfortable there or when I lay on her shoulder she boops my nose. And then when she hugs me she squeeze me so tight and just hugs me for a little while when god those times feels amazing. Or how when I’m able to get the crackhead out of her 24/7 and one night me and her was texting and she says “I love you, I actually love you....” and like she don’t think I saw that but I did. And then it’s the times where she Lowkey sorta disregards everything else to talk to me it seems. But also there’s the one side where it tells me that she doesn’t like me. When after a week of telling her I like her she was like “ugh you still like me stop already” and she would say those sometimes. She can be known as a hard ass but she has her reasons. Just she makes me feel something else and I don’t know if u should try to make some moves and ask her out or just keep it on the down low? What should I do?"
How to cope with a breakup?,"hi, first post! please be nice I'm baby.

anyway so my bf of 19 months (16m) just broke up with me (16n) and has taken my (previously our) whole friend group with him. 
i'm struggling to buckle down and focus on my classes (which require a lot of focused study) because i keep thinking about him and us and all my messy drama feelings. 

my family doesn't know I was even dating him, so I can't ask them for support. i have a couple online friends but I don't want to rely on them to be my whole support system. I'm in therapy, but i don't have another appointment until mid-January because of christmas etc.

I'm looking for no-bullshit advice to be able to just set aside all of my drama and concentrate on schoolwork, something I have a hard time doing normally let alone now (ADHD/autism/mental illness is fun). i really need to just focus on my classes for the next year and a half so I can get into a good college, and im struggling to support and motivate myself even with the knowledge that studying now will help me later, because what does it even matter if I'm completely alone? ugh, teenage drama.
 
anyway, anything helps. if you don't have any advice I will also accept fun science facts. biology-related facts preferred (it's my favorite)"
How do I F(M 15) stop this feeling for a teacher(F 30+)?,"Hi, I'm just wondering is it normal to have a crush on your teacher/teachers? Because I've always understood that when you're at school, you're there to be taught by the teachers however I've always had a crush on this particular teacher since Year 9( I'm in year 11 now) and I feel like I'm relapsing and I don't want these feelings no more. Like I really like being around her cause she makes me feel comfortable however I don't want to feel horny everytime she walks by. I understand that teacher/student relationships are illegal and I know not to act on my feelings because it's ruin both our lives but I really respect my teacher and I don't want to feel like this around her anymore. I want to feel like I can talk to her without getting horny and frustrated at myself for being like the way I am."
"I've so much things to do, but i don't know WHEN to do it.","I'm an high school student that has a lots of passions and also a social life. My days are always ending in the same way: I go to bed really tired knowing that i didn't do neither an half of the things I put me in charge to do at the beginnig of the day. So really often I loose my motivetion and i stop believing in myself. I hate this. Please, please, help me. What should I do?"
Need outside opinion,"One of my close friends had an incident recently. They were at their boyfriend's house and things were turning intimate. He asked her if she was ready/wanted to have sex with him. She told him that she wasn't ready and wanted to wait. She got a call and came off the phone crying. After he saw her like that, he starts making more moves and pushing it further and having sex with her. She called me crying about it, and how she didn't want to do it. What do you guys think"
Advice,"Some background about me I’m a 19yo Male. I recently moved from the city to the suburbs of Chicago. I’m a introvert and I’ve been told by numerous people that I’m very mature for my age. I’m a virgin not because I’m saving myself for marriage but because I can’t bring myself to just have sex with randoms or manipulate to get in too someone’s pants. I’ve also never been in a full real relationship but you probably figured that by now. 

When it comes to women I try not to be picky. No one is perfect especially me, but I do look for woman that are mainly introverted, sweet, and focused. These personalities seem to not be very common. No offense to others but the social media type women just aren’t my type which is fine because I’m most likely not there type but it seems that every girl is like that and it’s becoming difficult to not adjustment my standards because I do want a relationship. I also over think things a little which can be hindering me to an extent.

What should I do? Should I try to engage with more common personalities or broaden my preferences?"
How do u overcome self hate?,I have almost no interest in living In almost 16 and I feel like a loser. I can’t even be around people my age. I’ve been treated really bad by class mates since the 3rd grade. I was a really happy kid. I feel like a complete disappointment. I don’t have talents. I’m probably the most average person. I haven’t been to school in 2 months I went to a psychiatric hospital. I feel so alone. I’m more scared of life than I am of death. I feel so worth less
How Do I Become Independent From My Mother,"I live with just me and my mother and I feel trapped. She won't let me get a job so I have to be dependent on things such as the car I drive and money. If I try to get a job she'll take away my car so I won't have a way to get to work. I feel like she uses these things in order to manipulate and mentally abuse me so I don't know how to escape the cycle. I'm about to go off to college and I want to use this opportunity to get away from her but she would also have to cosign on my loans so I feel like there's nothing I can do to get away from her.

What can I do to get away from her and become independent?"
My boyfriends best friend touched me during a sleepover,"My boyfriend and I have been together about a year and I’ve been friends with his friend group since then, I’ve never had a problem with anyone and we all got along very good. Which meant we have a lot of sleepovers, we had a sleepover at my house a week ago and then I got woken up during my sleep to find my boyfriends best friend basically on top and him fingering him I pushed him off and went and slept in the bathroom the whole time. I haven’t told my boyfriend yet because I don’t know how he would react, and now I’m terrified to hangout with his friends especially his best friend and I don’t know what to do because I keep canceling plans on them which led to my boyfriend becoming very annoyed. And to add on as of yesterday his best friend who touched me is now dating his younger sister. 

Update: 

I just told my boyfriend who told his sister and now his sister and mom are sending me threatening text messages and calling me a liar and they are non stop calling me and leaving very rude and harsh text messages and voicemails and then the whole friend group turned on me even this girl named Sam who I was friends with and told the day after it happened

I have no clue what to do anymore I hate my body. I hate myself I can’t even have sex anymore because of how disgusting I feel all my anxiety and panic attacks came back that’s been gone for years and now I just destroyed his whole family and friend group and I also lost all my friends and no one believes me and I didn’t even want to tell my boyfriend because I felt this would happened and now I’m just so scared and sad"
I need help with this girl I’m persuing.,"Hi, I am in 10th grade and I need help with someone I’m pursuing, she is the cutest, funniest, smartest, and nicest girl I know. Thing is, I haven’t talked to her in a while when we used to talk a lot all the time. I feel it would just be super suspicious/obvious if I just email/talk to her out of nowhere. We have no classes together this semester but we might have a chance next semester which is happening soon. Any advice on how to approach this and get the friendship back up again is appreciated."
Can someone report you to the police for an online argument. Details below:,So basically I was arguing with a random person on the internet about politics. I had messaged her first after she had put something on her story about a political party and I disagreed. We argued for sometime after she continuously insulted me and questioned my mental state. I on the other hand kept to the argument and never personally insulted her. Later on when she was loosing the agreement she said I was harassing her and asked how? She then told me to leave her alone and I asked how? She then told me to leave her alone and I replied ok sorry you felt that way. The last message she sent was her saying I am reporting you to the police for harassment. I am now shit scared and worried if she can take it to the police. I doubt she can as I feel like i’ve done nothing wrong but some assurance would be nice. I live in the Uk as well.
I used to be the best,"So, i need help coping with the fact that i used to be the best in my choir- compliments every other second. Now my very close friend is the loudest and has the best voice and i realize how bad i actually am.

Now i suffer from sever depression and bipolar disorder and on top of the there are a lot of crazy things going on in my life right now so this is very important to me because choir is the only thing that keeps me from taking my own life (dont tell anyone that😂) and now i find out im actually shit at it. Help? How do i stay alive like deadass no ha ha edgy teen shit im on the verge right now.               

If this isnt the right comunity please let me know!! Thanks"
Relationship Advice? Sex Advice?,"So basically I am not in a relationship with anyone, not dating them at least. They told me a while back, after they first confessed they were attracted to me, that they didn't want to date me because they didn't want to mess it up. I was okay with not being in a relationship with them, but I share the same feelings with them. A month or so ago we were having a deep conversation and they said that the main reason why they didn't want to date me was because they knew we would never break up unless it was very serious. They didn't want to lose me, and jeopardize our relationship. I understand completely. 

So even though we aren't dating, we say we love each other everyday, talk everyday, play video games together, and we even sit down and watch movies together for hours quite often. There is never a day that goes by without us showing our affection for each other. 

A problem that is going to come up, without a doubt in my mind, is sex. I know that they would never try to force sex on me. But they've already told me that they do want to have sex, and I mean, so do I. The thing is, I don't want to be a FWB (friend with benefits) to them. I don't want to have intimate relations like that with someone that's not official, or boyfriend/girlfriend, engaged, married, ect. I just don't know how to say that to them. And I don't want them to feel like they are expected to by my boyfriend/girlfriend. But I don't feel comfortable doing it with someone who's relationship status is still a friend. And I also don't want them just to say yes because they want the sex.

What can I do, or say to them? Am I stuck with just being best friends with them? I want to be more then friends but I feel like it's been to long?"
"Hey, I need some drama advice.","Hello. First of all, I want to address that I suffer from anxiety and depression. 

Now I’ll get into the situation;
I sit with a group of girls at lunch in highschool, I do not know them that well, but they’re in the same grade as me and will talk to me, which is rare because I’m reserved and keep to myself. I sit with them because every one else in my lunch shift is an upperclassman (I’m a pathetic freshman :/), and like I said before, I have really bad anxiety and can’t bring myself to go up to some random person and talk to them or sit with them. 

Anyways, there’s this one girl who sits there and she’s the epitome of a Leo. Everyone sides with her and believes everything she says. 
For the past couple of weeks, she says that her mom “abuses her” and stuff.. Her mom is a member of the faculty and I immediately did not believe her.

Today was significant because one of the girls asked if they need to call CPS. 

Today, I told that girl’s ex best friend, who is my best friend, about the situation. (Let’s call her B). I asked her to get in contact with the girls mother and inform her about the situation, which she did.

Her mother recently called me and asked about everything, and I told her the truth. She asked me why I mentioned it to B. I told her that her name was being thrown around in a discriminatory matter, and I assumed she wouldn’t like that. She agreed and told me she would call the other girls and ask them about it.

This might be a little selfish, but the reason I’m having trouble with this is because I know that the mother’s daughter will hate me. She’ll talk shit about me, as she did to B who stopped being friends with her because B called her out on being a pathological liar. 

Again, they’re the only people I sit with. I don’t know anyone else and lunch is 25 minutes long. I have really bad social anxiety and I don’t know where to go. What should I do? 

Sorry this post was really long. I just really need some advice.. thank you for reading"

A Little Paranoid I Might Be Pregnant,"so as soon as i (f16) got a boyfriend (m17) my parents put me on birth control (depo shot) understandably me and him decided to stop using condoms since they were giving me a weird allergic reaction (probably the spermicide on them) every time we had sex.

so i got the shot around the beginning of october, and there was only one time when he didn’t pull out because being put on the birth control was giving me some nasty emotional and physical side effects so i wanted to take full advantage of it. this was november 29th

so even before that ive been spotting on and off for about 3 weeks (it lets up a little sometimes and we manage to be able to do stuff when it does) and only after the 29th did it start getting heavy. I’ve been eating a lot more and i’ve gained 8 lbs (weight gain and spotting are side effects of the bc). im extremely paranoid that i might be pregnant even though theres about a 1% chance that i am... my parents are very religious and i wouldn’t be able to get an abortion. my mind wont stop thinking about it, i need some reassurance. help?"
my mum always makes me feel bad about myself,every time i talk to my mum it’s always negative. she always says i only have one friend and that i always have an excuse for everything because i don’t have a job and i don’t often drive on my learner license. she always makes me feel so worthless
Need some advice with a girl I like,So I don’t really know what to do I’m a 16yr old guy and I really like this girl and I would just go for it but her family and mine don’t really mix and I don’t know wether or not I should just go for it and try to work through it cause I know that at our age (she’s 16 aswell) we can’t really not worry about our parents so I don’t know if I should be treating it like I should just value her for her or to think of it as her and her family are a package deal cause I know it’s way too selfish to expect her to forget about her family I also don’t know if she feels the same way
Female advice pls read!,"So there’s this girl we messed around one time just kissing it prob would have gone farther but I had a fast food meal before and just as the alcohol hit my stomach I felt like I was going to puke. So in the end I went home and puked my brains out.

Confused,"How do I tell my boyfriend that I can’t forgive him. Yesterday he wasn’t happy with me and he wouldn’t tell me why(he does that a lot) and he said “f**k you” to me. He’s never done anything like that towards me and I told him it was okay because he apologized but I can’t forget it. Recently we’ve been fighting a lot and I really do love him and he loves me, he just doesn’t communicate enough. He’s always talking about things he wants to do when we’re together and sweet talking me but I just want to have a normal conversation instead of talking like that. What should I do?"
I need help with my crush,So I like this guy I've known him for about 5 years but we never really hang out I just knew he existed.

I wanna tell him how I feel but I dont know how. Please help. I wanna cry so bad everytime I look at him. My chest hurts and I cant take a single breathe.
MMA training,"Hey everyone I have been training some MMA lately with a friend and I have been enjoying it for the most part 
But
At the end of each training session the class does something called a roll where u grapple for 3 mins and then change partners which is good for learning submissions 

My problem is I have to roll with a guy who is like 20 and he just over powers me and feels me up or else puts me in choke holds which hurt loads and leave legit marks on me 

I spoke to my friend about this and he just says MMA is a rough sport and he had seen the guy going hard on everyone   And I should just chill ?

So I’m asking if I’m over reacting to this because his hands went up my top more than once now"
(14m) Is it bad to like makeup?,"Let me preface this by saying I’m male and straight.


So tonight I was at a friends house for her birthday and we decided to play truth or dare and I ended up getting my makeup done. It wasn’t that noticeable except for my eyes but she put blush, concealer,  eyeshadow and lipstick on as well as others. And I didn’t wanna show anyone but I really enjoyed it. It made me feel really good about myself and I would definitely do it again even though I was super nervous and kind of embarrassed. Is it bad for me to like it even though I’m a boy? I’ll accept disagreement but please don’t attack me"
my parents won’t let me decide my own bedtime,"i am currently a 16 year old girl living with my parents. on school nights there’s a rule that i have to go to sleep at 10:30 and put my phone out in the lounge. during weekends i’m responsible for my own bedtime which i’m happy with. however, i believe that i should be given that responsibility on school nights also but my parents refuse to hear me out and it always results in an argument. i’ve tried to explain to them that i’m old enough to be responsible for my own bedtime and if i do have to have a bedtime, 10:30 is too early for a 16 year old girl.

i’m now on study leave for my exams and i’m waking up at 10 every morning but they’re making me go to sleep at 11 with my phone in the lounge. i want to decide my own bedtime, which would change depending on what time i’m waking up the next morning, and i’d always make sure i’d get enough sleep. what should i do?"

NEED advice for telling my friend how I feel about her.,"Ok. Hi everyone, how are you all doing today? So I need some advice for fellow teens. I've been into my friend for the last 2 years and I REALLY like her, but I don't want to tell her, cause I'm afraid of the worst (whatever that may be). We've been friends for about 3 years now, and have known each other for 4. Since I'm a Junior, I've pretty much gotten about 18(?) months to somehow tell her. She's like my best friend and she's extremely important to me. It feels like I've known her more than friends I've been with since 6th grade. I dont know what to do, because I just don't. She's NOT dating anyone right now, so I'm clear there. Today was her birthday, but I couldn't get her anything, so I'm planning to getting her stuff tomorrow before school. I'll make my decision of telling her or not based on you guys. Thanks!"
Might have Sex for the first time,Hey Reddit I need some advice I might have sex for the first time very soon idrk where to start ik shes interested and very into the idea  but I dont want it to be a good ole fuck fest I want it to be real and for her to actually feel something from it besides physically
Is she toxic ? How do I get out of this relationship without hurting anyone ? :(,"so I have been friends with this girl ( Y ) for quite some time . But lately our friendship has been going down the drain , It's just a buildup of some things that have been happening and have happened that I can't turn a blind eye to it anymore . Just recently it was her birthday and we wished her a happy bday but didn't buy her a cake . She did get a cake from her other friends in the next class so that night she called us out indirectly on IG saying how she would spend all of our bday and that she was naive to think that she even had a spot in our heart , she later proceeded to say she was stupid to think this friendship is real & she doesn't matter to us . She has a tendency to call people out on her social media when they're being ""unfair"" or not nice to her . From my viewpoint , I think just because we're friends doesn't mean  we're not obliged to buy her cake and she usually doesn't even split the bill when we have birthday cakes .

Another thing that really sets me off are her comments whenever I go hang out with other people than her. For example she would ask me where I'm going after school and I would reply "" oh I have plans with B ""  (my other friend) then she would say & I quote "" you bitch why do you hang out with B , you're always hanging out with ugly people . "" end quote .  Sometimes Y would say how I'm leaving her for B and how I don't care about Y anymore :( I just feel like Y expects me to be there for her 24/7 and it equals to ignoring her if i decide to hang out with my other friends . Our whole class thinks dealing with Y is a hassle and some have even told me to ignore her but it's just that she is a nice to me and we do have some good memories together but now it's too much for me to handle and sometimes I just want my own space and I can't even get that without seeing another of her post on her social media of how her friends are leaving her  . Just this week she got admitted to the hospital and she pm me saying "" just wanted to tell you i won't come to school tomorrow but never mind you don't care anyways ""

She was also asking on her social media that if she died would we have anything to tell her . When me & my other friend ( O ) paired up for an activity , Y tells me she's disappointed in me that I chose to pair up with O . These are just some of things that i'm talking about as they're more recent and the ones that really put me off . I'm just tired of all this and sometimes I do like an a\*\*hole for choosing to hang out with my other friends . I literally have no idea what to do , I somehow feel like i'm stuck in the middle with her and my other friends with no exit ."
I need an opinion about dating.,"I’m a 15 y/o boy and I’ll b 16 at the end of March. There’s this girl in a club I’m in who’s 16. Do you know that feeling you get where every time you see someone and they look at you it becomes impossible to not be happy? That’s the way I feel with this girl and she’s super cute and we’re both interested in the Same stuff and she just seems like a girl who would be right for me. However, I have only ever dated 1 other girl and I’m worried I won’t have a lot of time because I play 2 sports, and take advanced classes in school and the ref youth hockey on the weekends. It seems like she likes me too because whenever we make eye contact she smiles a little and looks away and seems like she is happy to talk to me. (We worked an event together today so we talked for like 3 hrs today). The only thing is: I am worried we wouldn’t be able to stay professional in the event we break up and I don’t want it to be awkward if we break up because in this club we need to be professional and be able to work well together. Any advise on what to do?"
How do I give someone I care about space without getting scared?,"My girlfriend that I’ve been with for almost two years and I recently had a long talk that ended in us breaking up, she’s currently been dealing with some things personal things and we’ve both been so busy with work and schooling. She told me that she needs space and that she can’t talk to me while she’s having space, what should I do? It’s been on my mind since and every time I think about her I start to worry that she’s hurting or she’s gonna find someone else and then I end up texting her too much, and I just wanna find out how to deal with this until she’s ready to talk again."
My mother looks through my texts,"Im 18 years old, and just found out my mother has been closely monitoring me for up to five years on the internet.
I found out two weeks ago when she accidentally exposed herself, screaming at me because I vented about my step dad being an asshole in a private chat to my friend- she then admitted that she logs into every one of my accounts on everything she knows of, and reads every message I send
This is incredibly unsettling not only because Im an adult and deserve my own privacy, but over the last year Ive sent nudes, shared links to porn art with my friends, and talked about sexual things
Ive threatened to go to the police and report her for this severe invasion of my privacy, but she shot back saying she would report me for slander of her and my stepdad (I vent a lot about them)
I just don’t know what to do, and the paranoia Ive been feeling these last two weeks is making me feel physically sick and suicidal."
how do i get him off my mind(f16),"i was inseparable friends with a guy in my grade and we kinda merged friends and made a big group of us that were very close. a couple months ago everyone started kinda getting heated at eachother with possible relationships or just petty fights so the group split after a bit but me and him still hung out everyday for another two months. we kinda drifted when school started and since then i’ve been very depressed and put on medication. i don’t know if it’s him, school, or bad genetics but i can’t fucking live like this. everyday i think of how happy i used to be and it actually physically hurts my chest. it feels like i won’t be that happy again and i’m too scared to tell anyone that i think the reason is that my friend dropped me. that sounds pathetic and a lot of people thought we were dating which we weren’t. that could complicate things for both of us so i don’t want my friends to think i got depressed because he broke up with me. i also don’t want to tell my doctors because my mom is always in there with me and she also thought we were dating. but it all seems like i’d be judged so hard for being weak. weak enough to completely spiral because my friend left. does anyone know how to get someone off your mind and just basically forget about them or any coping mechanisms? or maybe i should just tell my therapist that’s the reason i think this happened but i really don’t want to because it is so fuckin pathetic."
Electrocution??,"Hello!! ^^ I havent posted on here in a while!! I haven't recently ran into any creeps which is fortunate!! 💀💀 so instead I have a question! I sleep with my phone charged in by my bed and i lay it on my bed far away from me when im sleeping, yet my dad still comes in my room and lectures me about unplugging it because I'll get ""electrocuted""...I get that he's concerned but ever since I had a phone Ive been doing this and nothing has happened, the charger doesn't even heat up! I try to tell him this and that I'm safe but he never takes me seriously or listens to me for any reason at all because ""Im younger"" so I just give up and I dont say anything. Would my phone actually electrocute me?? Isnt it just the same as me plugging in my nightlight?? (Which is also near my bed, it uses the same outlet as my phone, and its plugged in longer than my phone is) I wont make a big fuss over it cause that would be silly but I'm just very curious to know if thats actually hazardous, usually I wouldnt be asking this kind of stuff but he thinks everything is dangerous and that's not an exaggeration...I can't go outside or sleep over by family and Im almost 18. What do I do??"
I want to be my old self again,"Hi! I'm 17 years old and don't know what's happening with me. I want to be my old self again. 

When I was in elementary, I was a really good student (please, I'm not bragging). I was always at the top in our class. I get high scores and grades. When I graduated elementary, I was the one who has most medals. When I took an entrance exam for a science high school, I was in rank 27.5 out of 200+. Yeah, I think I was doing great as a student.

Not until I reach high school tho. That was the time I started to lose my grip in acads. I started to have lower grades (but still passing) and I struggle in acads especially exams and quizzes and recitations. Still, I managed to pass and have a with Honor Award until the end of junior high (Grade 10). 

As I reached grade 11, Senior high, this is where I get worse. I can't focus and concentrate anymore. I struggle learning and listening in our class and discussions because my mind is always blank or always easily distracted. I daydream a lot. Whenever I review for our quizzes, I find it so difficult to review because the information I read doesn't retain in my head and i suck at memorizing now, unlike before, I was really good at memorizing. 

There was a time, I reviewed and studied for our quiz but at the time and moment of answering the quiz, my mind was blank! All the information I studied and reviewed was totally gone! I do not remember anything at all! I failed the quiz and I only got a score of 16 out of 45. I only got 16 because I managed to copy my classmate's answers. 

I was very frustrated. I'm not being lazy or anything. I can't seem to focus anymore. I am so unmotivated and I don't know why. I want to be the ""good"" student again. 

Now, I have realizations and thinking about the past. When I was 11 years old, grade 5, that was the time I  started to struggle more often in acads. And that was the time too when my dad's illness became worse and he started to become more really weak and thin. That was the time too when I started doing self harm and suicidal thoughts (but not much). I thought they were normal and I have this thinking before of harming other people like torturing them or something but that kind of thinking was eventually gone when I reached grade 6 (but self harming and suicidal thoughts did not stop). I don't cut myself, but I do punch or hit myself with something like bottles or hammer. 

Since grade 5, I did not saw my dad smile again and I was really studying hard for him. When I was in grade 6, I thought that in our graduation, I'll see him smile. I told him that he'll be the one who will be on the stage with me so he'll put my medals on me. Unfortunately, 12 days before our graduation, he died, and I witnessed how he died. The day before his death, he called me and I saw him lying in his bed, very weak that he can't even open his eyes. I went near him and he was raising his hand, so I held it. He told me the words that hurt me so much, he said to me, ""I'm sorry, I cannot attend your graduation anymore."" And that was his last words to me.

Grade 7, 13 years old, the time where my suicidal thoughts became worse and the start of me being so unmotivated in school and struggling on focusing. At that time, I searched on the internet about my suicidal thinking and there appeared about mental illness and depression. But I don't want to self diagnose lol

My ""depression"" became worse when I was in Grade 8. Everyday, I always think how I'll kill myself. I also had this situation wherein Everytime I'll sleep, I'll dream! I have this condition since I was in grade 7. I thought it was cool since dreaming in sleep makes me feel like I'm in another world or something but then eventually I found it very annoying and tiring! I wake up very tired because of dreaming and I feel like it's making me insane! In about 1 and a half years, there was no single sleep where I'm not dreaming. 

Thankfully, I managed to get rid of ""depression"" when I started writing in a diary/journal when I started to have interest in stationeries.

Another thing about me is that I daydream too much and I have characters. I started doing this when I was 5 years old but I think that is normal. The thing is, up until now, I daydream like a kid and it's worse. Why? Because it distracts me so much and I cannot focus with the things I do because of it. There is so many triggers of my daydreams. 

Addition, I do not like being with my friends often because I wanted to be alone because if I'm alone, I can daydream more and I can have moments more with my characters. The urge is too much. 

I have a best friend character named Coco and I like being with him. I don't like him romantically. He is my best friend so yeah, it's fun being with him.

I'm emotionally numb too, unless I am with my ""characters"" or daydreaming. There were times that my classmates were emotional but I was confused because why am I not feeling anything. Sometimes I fake to have emotions which results to me doing inappropriate emotions or expressions in some situations. 

Another thing is that I often find it hard to sleep because I am daydreaming. Even though I am really sleepy, my brain keeps on daydreaming which makes me struggle to sleep. 

I know that all of this looks like now making any sense but I haven't shared this to anyone. I want to know what is with me. I want my old self back. I want to be the person again who can focus and concentrate in her studies and have good grades. I want to be the motivated student again. I want my old self. Please give me advice, please."
I need some help,"So,I have this friend,we’ll call her Ellie,so Ellie has some depression but not to the point of cutting but she keeps talking about wanting to die,she even told me she tried to kill her self once. Thing is she refuses the help I offer and going to the counselor,she says she is waiting for her doctor to open up a slot for her so she can get help. Tbh I am tired of her always complaining to me about how her life sucks and how she wants to die and how She wants help. Then the breaking point for me,Ellie has this guy she likes,let’s call him....Ben,so Ben is kinda already knew but wasn’t sure if Ellie actually liked him, I heard a conversation taht ben had with my classmates and they were trying it get him to spit out who he liked, I joined in and they said this girls name and he said “no and it’s not Ellie either”,Ellie is one of these types who get sad and angry at the boy they like when they talk with other girls,she said to me once how she hated him for talking to other girls and not her I replied with “well since he kinda already knows that you like him,it’s probably awkward for him.” She didn’t listen. So she saw me talking with them and asked me what we Were talking about,I told her everything,she started crying and said she couldn’t do anything anymore,I then suggested the counselor again,another no. After school we went to our dance club and after that,I quote her “I just want to scream my lungs out and until my throat starts bleeding and kill myself” I said not to do that,and told her if the consequences of killing herself. I actually told her to confirm everything with ben awhile ago but she declined, and I told her before if she didn’t do it this type of situation will happen,and told her to just either confess and clear things up or keep it in and either forget about him and try to move on or be in this situation. Now after I told her about the consequences of her dying,She again said she didn’t care and thinks that we will be fine after a few months. I had enough at that point. Ellie is a sweet Girl and I want to be her friend but I can’t take this anymore, she complains to me about dying and her depression but she declines my help and continues complaining to me,so I simply said “well it’s either you forget about him or do whatever the hell you are doing now,if you continue to whine to me all the time and keep refusing my help, you might as well suffer until some doctor comes and save you which isn’t anytime soon,move on from him,he’s just one guy you met in your 15 years of life,you have so many more chances in life later on. I’m done.” I feel really bad for saying that but I truly mean it,was I too harsh? Was I the one who’s wrong? I’ve never lashed out like this before in fear of her killing her self and stuff,please give me advice."
I am very confused,"here is some background info:
*I'm 15 y/o
*I have 2 siblings that are in their 20s, have graduated college, and are not living with me
*my sister divorced an abusive husband who is the older brother of somebody very popular at my school
*my parents are: in their late 50s,  depressed but do not get help, only watch TV after work, creationists, both have abusive childhoods
*I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, depression, ocd, and aspergers
*I'm in all advanced classes and in the gifted program

I have not done anything with my life besides play a select few video games (especially Roblox), watch YouTube, and masturbate. I barely interact with my family, even though they care about me very much. I'm an atheist, and I don't know how I will confront my parents about that , considering the last time my dad was confronted with something extraordinarily stressful (his parents getting in a car accident), he had a stroke. Also, I don't know about my sexuality. In real life, I only feel attracted to girls and look at them from time to time, but my sexuality is all over the place when I masturbate. I could want to give to a female, or take it from a dude, or give it to one. I have only masturbated to real life porn of girls, never guys. However, I have wanked to cartoon/furry/hentai guys, girls, yadda yadda. I have never looked or felt attracted to a guy, and I don't think I'm blocking anything. I could be though, and that worries me to no end. That could also be my OCD, same with my trans thoughts. I don't feel like I urgently need to become a woman or am one, but it comes up occasionally. Again, it could be my OCD, or I could be lying to myself. I don't know what to do with my life either. I think I want to do something in STEM and or music, but that could be another lie, and I really haven't explored my options. I have not had any will or desire to do anything. I had the occasional best friend, but it was only them, and it always ended in me realizing they were using me the whole time. I can't make any friends because they either have their own friend group and or are connected to the younger brother of that scumbag. I have never been directly bullied, but I can tell he is up to something.

I'm sorry if this makes no sense or is too descript. I am craving for help, and my parents won't get help for me, since it never worked for them, and they don't want to ""disappoint"" me."
How do I get over a crush I don't want?,"Throwaway because paranoid. TL;DR at bottom. Sorry for any errors spelling, or otherwise, it's late and I'm very tired right now. On mobile so.. yeah. So I(M17) recently met someone at work (I work at a coffee shop if it makes any difference) and I tried to deny it at first but I'm pretty sure I'm crushing hard. She's attractive, nice to talk to (when I'm not being awkward lol), funny, and just fun to be around. Don't even know if she's single and that makes it worse but I'm not gonna try and find out y'know? I'm 99.9% sure she has no interest in me at all but our first actual conversation, like not work talk, she told me a couple personal things you normally don't tell someone so fast and some minor things that would be hints at best. Honestly she's great but I just want to get over her I guess, for multiple reasons

1. I've never been in a relationship before and quite frankly, terrified of the Idea.

2. Legitimately don't know if I'm even ready to be in a relationship. Kind of coincides with no.1.

3. Probably the most Important thing is that I work with her and I don't want to make things awkward for myself or anyone else.

4. I'm pretty sure I don't even want a relationship right now, I like the pace I'm at right now and would like to go my own way for now.

5. I'm at a semi-pivotal point in my life right now and I need to focus on myself both mentally and physically.

All that aside, I still can't help but feel this way, I can't help it and it's driving me a little crazy. I just want to stop feeling this and just get over her but I don't know how. So Reddit, what do I do?



Sorry for the rant and any unnecessary info. Any advice helps. I think writing down why I want to be over this helped a little so that's good. Thanks for reading if you did. Might post this on other subs idk.



TL;DR, I have a crush on this girl I met and for a multitude of reasons I just want to get over her already. Any advice helps."
How do I talk to this boy?,"Hey ya'll, I hope ya'll can help me on this one! As a young girl and young adult, my mother and father never let me have a boyfriend or even a guy friend in general, so I never have had experience speaking with guys long term, if that makes any sense. Plus, I believe since I was sexually assaulted it just made me stay clear from any man in my life, so I never had a strong friendship or love interest even though I wished I did. I am very uncomfortable and weary about speaking to any guys, and I get very easily scared but I want to break this cycle. 

I moved to college as a freshman a few weeks ago, so I am super far away from home (which was intentional) and I want to be able to venture out in the world of boys. Not even for boyfriends, I just really want some guy friends in my life. So, my first target to befriend is a guy who I only spoke to for a few minutes to ask a question which took me a lot of guts to be honest, since I am also very insecure. Yet he was really nice and seemed like a genuine person- so this leads to the question. 

How do I talk to him now? We only have one class together and it's a college success class, and we don't share the same major even though he has the major I would love to pursue (can't though). How do I start a conversation and go about it, and would it be weird to even start one this far into the semester? I just don't know how to talk to guys, and it makes me awkward so a little help would be splendid. Thank you!"
My self worth is shit,"Hi,My name is xxx.
Lately,I've been feeling really worthless even though my friends and family keep complimenting me.Why do I feel like they're just saying this because they feel bad for me? Why do I constantly deny compliments towards me? Is it just teenage angst or what? My self confidence has plummeted down to the point where I just question everything I do.I've tried talking to adults about this but they all just keep saying the same thing over and over again. ""Have some confidence in yourself,you're great."" and then they change the subject.I'm trying my hardest to have pride in everything I do but the thoughts in my head keep piling up and I just-- I don't know what to do with myself anymore.Everytime I make a mistake I constantly judge myself until I just break down.I'm also in constant paranoia that everybody secretly hates me and hopes that I die in a ditch or something."
i dont know how to get along with my dad (really long but plz read. i need advice) i feel hopeless and idk who else to go to.,"im new to reddit and this is my first post. i’ve been dealing with this particular issue for about 4 years now and i don’t know what to do. 

tbh, i don’t even know where to start. i guess i can start with the obvious thing that I don’t know how to get along with my dad. to explain my dad in a nutshell, he’s a military man. he’s almost 50 and has the sense of humor of a 14 year old on XBOX. he’s a good guy, a helpful man. pretty selfless at times. 

here’s where our conflicts come in. as his daughter, i feel extremely emotionally disconnected. it took lots of dwelling and tearful nights to realize that there’s just a lot of disconnections going on. because my dad has been deployed so much, he didn’t exactly get to see me grow. i’m currently 16 almost 17 and he still treats me like i’m a 9 yr-old. 

the conflict truly began when he had to go to this one institute for a military school out of state. in order to keep me in the school that i was in, my parents decided that my dad would move while we stay. plus, the distance was only supposed to be for about a year. kinda important note, that discussion went without my knowledge considering i was 12 or so at the time. 

a little on me, i was used to being with my mom all the time and she was and still is my primary guardian. my dad was always a provider but never took on the role of father authority. that wasn’t ever established really. my dad took on the “fun guy” role. i wanted ice cream? we go and get ice cream. i want a new toy? as long as my grades were good (which they were) then i get a new toy. i was what most would call spoiled. which is true. i just never felt entitled to it because i also just never asked for much. just for my birthday and for christmas. never outside of that tbh. 

well, a little thing called puberty eventually hit. and when that happened, it was like the new hormones in my body had this uncontrollable vendetta against my father arose. i will admit, the beginning of our conflict was my fault. but at the same time, i was only 12 and now learning how to deal with this new cycle of my life. i needed guidance but that guidance quickly turned into an accusatory finger. 

at all started with small things. to preface, my dad has always been the kind of person to swear, but i was the kind of kid to repeat what i would hear and to avoid getting in trouble, my dad put a bit of a filter on himself. well, with time that filter would diminish almost completely. but it started with that. too much swearing. and not even just casual swears, it was honestly very vulgar. too vulgar for a young teen (12-14). and even now, i don’t mind curse words. i swear myself. i’m basically desensitized at this point. but that’s not important, that’s just where it began. 

then i started talking back to my dad when i didn’t agree with something he said. and there were times were i was being a bit of an ass i will admit. it wasn’t okay of me. yet even then, my dad didn’t have the gut to put me in my place. when the back talking started getting much? my mom had to tell me “your father said if you don’t stop with the back mouthing he’s gonna have to lay his foot down” and i honestly just wanted to shrug it off, he couldn’t even tell em that himself. any time in the future, he would sit me down, tell me how he felt, then nothing would happen. everything at a standstill. no progress. i didn’t know how to take him seriously. 

i couldn’t take my dad seriously at the time for a  handful of reason. despite his age, we still acts very immature in situations where that behavior is unnecessary. my mom tells him something he didn’t like? he’s rub his nose or forehead with his middle finger to basically flip her off. he gets confronted about something? turns himself into the victim and emphasizes the sacrifice he makes which has nothing to do with the confrontation. that or he lies. someone compliments him? often times he doesn’t thank the person, just says “i know” or something along those lines. i could go on but then it would be a manifesto. 

the conflict between us has even gotten between my mom and i. im super close with my mom. but recently, i felt heavily misunderstood by her. i would talk to my mom about how i felt and she wouldn’t give my grievances a second thought. she’d explain that i have to accept him because that’s the way he is. i’m not asking my dad to be perfect. no one is. i just ask that he calms down and tones it down a bit. he can’t explain anything without cursing up a storm and being loud as shit. when i was doing very poorly mentally, i cried to my mom twice about how i felt. with school, with myself, with my dad. everything. i’m crying my eyes out to her and both times she told me that she didn’t understand why i was crying, that i should be grateful i even have a dad, and to suck it up. i felt devastated and heartbroken after. i haven’t opened up to my mom since (it’s been about 7-8 months since that). 

i tried to fix my wrongs several times but each attempt was completely overlooked my both of my parents. the worst experience was when my dad was making empty threats about the people sitting behind us in the movie theater. my mom not being fluent in english, i had to explain some things about the movie which i did as quietly as possible. my dad apparently noticed that the people behind us made comments about it (but knowing that my dad thinks everyone is out to judge him and his family, he most likely took something innocent, personally). when we left he made a threat somewhere along the lines of “if they would have said something to you guys, i would have knocked the shit out of them” and said “they aren’t about it tho. no one was gonna say anything. they didn’t the entire movie” and he turns around, looks me dead in the eye and sternly says “watch who you’re talking to” to which he has never done to me. he’s never played his authority over me, ever. so i did what i normally do, just shut down. i became void of showing any emotion to anyone the rest of the day. a skill i got very good at throughout the years. later, we go to a hardware store and a car barely slowed down when we were crossing the street. my dad stared down the car menacingly and i rolled my eyes as he was turning around. he happened to catch me out of the corner of his eye and got in my face saying, “you can decide to not talk to me for the rest of the day, rest of the weekend or even ever. but keep in mind that i just want to protect you” i simple stared back at him blankly and continued to follow my parents around the store deadpanned. like his stare was gonna stop a huge truck from hitting my mom and i. i understood his point, the execution was just not very tactical. then, there was a little situation at the cash register and my dad verbally calls out a lady that left the cashier before the next person (who moved from a different line) could reach her register. im fairy certain she didnt see the man hence why she left. anyway, my dad say the thing and called out the rudeness of the situation without giving it a second of thought. he then shades me to the man, “i had to speak my mind although some people,” he looks at me, “might not like it”. i look at my mom in disbelief and then continue on my deadpan journey. i refused to hug my parents goodnight. i was mad at my dad and my mom was asleep. she’s a light sleeper so i wasn’t gonna wake her up to say goodnight. i said goodnight from the doorway of their room and cried myself to sleep that night. 

my mom told me after that i need to cut out the way i’ve been acting. that i ask too much of my father and that i’m the one that needs to change. i’ve been beat down for simply standing up for what i believe in. i just want my dad to chill out but i can only get a reaction out of him when we’re both upset. civil conversations always end up with no result. 

i tried to get to him in other ways but i always feel like i cant talk to him. he takes anything that isnt ass-kissing his ideas as defiance. we can never have civil discussion about any topic because i am a talkative person (incase it wasnt evident by this post) and i like to use lots of examples to make my point. my dad being such a straight to the point guy, rudely rushes me and gets impatient so he stops listening or interrupts me. but things where always like this. he used to listen to every word i would say when i was younger. but now, i can’t talk for more than a few moments at a time before he feels the need to make comment or irrelevantly add some kinda related experience he had. he’s so full of himself lately that i don’t feel like i can get him to look eye to eye with me. it’s like he cant fathom the fact that “his little princess” would have something bad to say about him. 

i could honestly go on forever and i’ll end this mess of a post with this. i’m leaving for college in less than two years. i want to fix things with my dad before then but i dont know how. he has this wall of insecurities and unresolved trauma growing up (along with trauma from being in the military) that he needs to resolve. he thinks he can win me over with petty little gifts but that’s not what i want or need. but he still continues to do it even after i’ve asked him not to. what can i do? i’m hopeless at this point and i’m in a constant state of self doubt and self hatred because of it. i keep trying to better things while my dad gets progressively worse and idk what to do. 

tl;dr (i think that’s how it’s used) my dad and i cant get along because we can’t communicate and he often sheds the light as him being the victim. (not very accurate, please take the time to read. i’m sorry)."
Stupid question from a middle school girl about a crush,"School started a week ago for me and since last year I've had a crush on a boy at my school, ugh. We aren't friends, I just like his personality and I find him funny, but I ""hate"" him and whatever, so we don't talk, but when we were in two of the same classes (last year) sometimes I would be in his group or I would get to be around him, but now I don't have any classes with him and I only see him around lunch and recess time. Whats some advice to get over a crush or how I can find ways to talk to him or be around him. If you answer my stupid question, thanks, I know its weird, I just don't talk to my friends about this or whatever as I said I ""hate"" him. Thanks."
help me fellow depressed teens of reddit,"I am a 16 year old teen thats turning 17 in two days. Ive changed schools 9 times since kindergarten. Due to some shitty circumstances my aunt(on father's side) and grandmother(mothers side) have joint custody of me. I used to live in Kentucky and went to a school where I got good grades, had good friends, and had relationships with the teachers (like a mentor/mentee) but my aunt had decided that I should go live with my grandmother and said if I didnt like it I could come back. Ive been down here for 4 months and am 2 weeks into school going onto 3rd and she has said that i cant come back. I have a past with depression and so far it's come back to kick my ass. Ive tried to make the best of it by going to school and trying to do what was needed. Now no offense to any florida natives but your schools make suicide prevention seem like a fucking heaven, the kids at the school are assholes and havn't even tried to communicate with me and despite my best efforts to communicate with them I'm left feeling that they just dont give 2 shits about me, the teachers here have a huge tendency to distance themselves from students and make having a mentor/mentee relationship feel like a kill yourself already relationship. I REALLY NEED ADVICE BECAUSE I AM DROWNING IN THIS SHIT and all my support is back in kentucky telling my aunt she is an idiot. Now before people say anything I want to point out, I dont do bad shit, neither of my parents can take care of me, there is a portion of the story that just can't be written down do to all the typing id have to do, and I dont need corny advice like just be yourself or give it time, ive had a shitty life and id like to keep the highschool part of it from being fucked into a gaping mess because I cant take the environment down here."

Idk whats wrong with me,"So I made this account because I have no one to talk to about it. But recently ive been having so many mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks. Nothing is wrong and I'm living a decent life. I know its probably because I'm a teen going through puberty and stuff but I dont see ppl with this problem.

I really need help and advice,"Hi I'm 16 years old and going to be a junior next year at my highschool. I ran track as a sophomore and now am doing cross country try over the summer but I have a big problem. My coach had a talk with me and my mom telling me he doesn't think I can continue on into the fall with the team running without being injured all the time and not being able to run. He said this and my mom agreed with him so now I basically got dropped from the team. The reason he said this is because I have screws in my foot from when I broke my ankle in the 8 th grade because I thought I had to play football and now my right ankle doesn't bend all the way forward which causes loads of imbalances in my running form that cause injuries. I basically suffered through the summer with running and was really stressed out but I worked my ass off and now being off the team I've just stopped. School has not started yet and theirs still a practice meet coming up which I could run in but I just feel so out of shape and my parents are set on me not running anymore. The coach told me I could join back on the team and run but it would have to be okay with my mom. I really wanna finish what I started in training and not loose my fitness but I've just been so unmotivated and seditary not running this week that I don't know if I can even have the ability to run. Everyday that goes by I can't stop thinking about how I should be running and the whole team is running without me. I hated practice when I was running and my ankle just made evei more stressfull but I LOVED everything that came with the running. The feeling of accomplishment after running 10 miles to taking an ice bath after to being able to eat big meals and feeling accomplished knowing how much work I just put in is like an addiction and I cant drop it. But now it's like what's the point of even running 4 miles if I'm not in cross country... I could still join back or just become a regular person and not be an athlete but I hate the idea of that. Also even if I did join back I know that I'm basically at square one right now and I would have to go through all this shit again in putting my all into train just so I can get to a reasonable level of fitness which pisses me off. Schools about to stark and I'm lost. Running did ruin my summer but I'm just to involved and invested in running to just stop.... Forever. I don't know what to do. I thought it would be fun to not have to worry about waking up early everyday and run, but now that's its actually a reality all I can think about is how i should be running. Just any advice would help."
I don't know what to do,"so i created this throwaway to ask this quesiton.  I dont really have anyone to talk to abt this so im kinda desperate.  Im entering highschool and ive been dating this girl for around two and a half months.  Ive known her since i was in kindergarten.  Becuase we go to private schools we can choose what school we go to.  I am going to a school that is around 45 minutes away from my house.  My older brother also goes there so he will be able to drive me there every day.  My girlfriend is going to a school that is around 10-20 minutes away from my school.  Because she has a rich grandmother she will have an apartment out there.  She will be at the apartment Monday-Friday and will be back at here house that is 15 minutes away from mine on the weekends.  There are really two questions im going to be asking. We are really clingy and can barely be away from each other for a few days without missing each other a lot.  I am wondering what i should do.  I dont want to breakup with her because i am not very attractive, on a good day a 6, but she is sooo beautiful and amazing.  I really wouldnt be able to do better than her, which makes only seeing her once a week even harder.  I just don't know what to do.  The second question i have is about her and her friend.  I live in Pennsylvania, about a 15 minute drive to new jersey.  But my girlfriends best friend is going to be moving to new york city for school in a week.  Because my girlfriend and her are best friends, they're both taking it pretty hard.  I really hate it when my girlfriend is sad and lately with her best friends move to new york city its been happening more and more often.  I want to know if there is a way that i can make her feel better about this move.  I would really appreciate any help."
(ADVICE) My Parents Don’t Care,"hi. I just needed to get this off my back. Any advice would be great. ps im not great at expressing my feelings with words. 

I feel so trapped in my own house. It’s to the point where I just feel sad all the time. My parents work everyday (seriously, they have no day off) until 8 pm. Don’t get me wrong, I know they work hard to provide for me. But because they’re gone all day, I’m left home all alone. There’s often nothing to eat at home and because I’m the only one home, I’m expected to take care of all the housework. I know I sound like a brat, but I’m only 16... I wish I didn’t have to cook my own food and take care of the house. Instead of their daughter, I feel like their maid. The worst part? My parents are overly strict and protective (ironic, I know). I’m not allowed to leave the house at all. Sometimes I want to hang out with friends, like a normal teen for God’s sake. But I’m not supposed to leave the house alone and no one can drive me. If I could, I would get a job, take summer classes, or do something to get out of this damn house. But I cant and I don’t know what to do. This isn’t something new either- it’s been going on since I was 13. I just don’t know what to do."
Help a girl out please.,"I need to know if this kid is flirting with me or if he's just being nice. We work together, and he has been the only one to ever initiate a conversation with me. The other people I work with don't seem too keen with me but I don't give a fuck, so anyway. I don't really know if he's just trying to be nice, or if he is... you know what thinking about it, he's just being nice. Who the fuck am I kidding? I am ugly. Nvm, thanks, guys <3"
Me and my friend like the same guy,"So I’m hanging out with one of my long time friends and we both realize that we have a shared liking from one of our mutual friends. We talked about it and she said that should be fine if I went for it and she wouldn’t be upset. But I still feel kind of weird about that and like I feel bad, even though she said it would be OK .  And she is my best fetal I don’t want this to make things awkward bc obviously she still likes him even if I do end up dating him.
I’m perplexed. Help pls."
Update,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/c8abg7/señorita/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share was my last post.

She thought I left the country because I'm moving soon and she didn't even say goodbye. I know that's petty of me to put this up but that kinda hurt. So did her flirting with my mate in front of me. I feel like I should just blank her out and move on. I won't see her in a month anyway."
"My mom is smoking behind my step-fathers back , saying she quit - he quit smoking for HER , successfully.","I need some solid advice.

About a year ago my mom landed in a hospital due to  health issues -  connected to smoking.

She told my Stepfather (Michael) that she was gonna quit smoking cigarettes once she was out - he agreed and said he was gonna quit too - since he runs marathons and it would improve his preformance.

A couple months later my stepfather is smoke-free with iron will , a nicotine spray and a LOT of sport.

He enthusiastically tells me about how much money he's saving , how he can breathe easier and his stamina has gone way up - he drops me off at home and zooms to work.

I go out to the balcony and catch my mother - lighter in hand - smoking.

This shit has been going on for about a year - I tried to talk to her about it , tell her that not only is she ruining her health but also her relationship.
She made promises to quit and failed each and every one of them.

Michael has no clue - they literally got married 3 months ago - I've tried my best to just keep my mouth shut but I know that its only a matter of time until she gets caught - and that will end in tragedy.

tl;dr: My mother is lying to my stepfather about quitting smoking - I am afraid this will completely wreck their marriage."
Advice for family vs boyfriend,"So I’ve been dating this really really great guy for half a year now. He’s truly the best. He’s so respectful and caring and mature. We are both mature people so our relationship isn’t just a fling and we both treat it seriously, which is really great. My parents know he’s nice and they like him and they know how respectful he is. And his parents adore me. They invited me to his family only birthday party and they even invited me to their family summer vacation. They love me and they’re great people! The problem is that I feel like my parents don’t trust me or him. I’m never allowed to go to his house if someone isn’t home and god forbid I go in his room with him with the door closed. It’s just stressful. He’s such a great guy and he would never do anything like rape me or try to convince me to have sex. And I don’t want to have sex either. No thanks. Not at this age (16). But that’s just me personally, just to be clear I don’t judge anyone who is active and younger than me. But anyway, my mom knows I am very much not interested but she still doesn’t trust me. And my boyfriend and I have had the talk and both are on the same page of “hey I’m not comfortable with sex yet” so we both don’t want to cross that line right now. So where’s the problem. They know he’s a great guy, they knows he’s not gonna rape me, and they know I’m not planning on having sex. SO I DONT UNDERSTAND. And it’s not like his parents the are the same. They have invited me over before but said that they wouldn’t be home and they let me stay late (once I stayed til like 11) they’re great people and they respect and trust us as a couple. But not my parents. Ugh it’s just so frustrating"
I (m14) have an active sex life and need advice for buying condoms,"I am a 14 year old male who has an active sex life. Birth control (condoms) have always been provided by the female in question, however I need some of my own just in case. I don’t feel comfortable buying condoms, and there are no planned parenthood locations anywhere near me or free condom machines. What should I do? Buy condoms at the only convenience store in my very religious small town (where everybody talks to ands knows each other) and risk my dignity? Also, is it actually “okay” to buy condoms at my age?"
As a 21 year old (F) would it be better to see a male or female therapist?,"For the first time since i was 14, i’m going back to see a therapist. I had 2 sessions when i was 14 but quit, due to her(therapist) trying to make me seem insane or blame my family. Maybe it’s because i’m born into a muslim family that most females(bosses, teachers etc) try to look for an excuse to blame my family for everything, in short i learned to bullshit with every female authority that’s not family - so i thought why not try a male this time?

Any experiences with male therapists? Is it a good idea if you want to talk about anxiety, past sexual abuse etc? Or should i try again with a female?"
Someone please help me,Okay so I’m a 18 year old male. And I’m very confident around females and will talk to one all day long and be very charming and I am not scared to tell some one I want to have sex. I’m very confident around girls who I have little interest in. If I actually have real feelings for a girl I begin to act very insecure and shy. Why is this?
Family not supporting my choice for adoption,"My family has told me they just want what’s best for me. But I feel underlying pressure from especially my mom and older sister to keep my baby. Actually underlying is the wrong word, they desperately want me to keep this baby. And they don’t hide it at all. It hurts my feelings, because they claim to be my biggest supporters, although they’re only thinking about themselves. My mom referred me to this “adoption agency” so I filled out the form trusting her completely (how naive of me). When the woman from the organization called me, she was only trying to manipulate me to back out of adoption. I’m not exaggerating. I felt completely attacked. When I confronted my mom about it she got pissed at me, said “I think you should know all the facts” she completely blind sighted me. I understand her hurt for this situation, but she’s my mother and she’s completely manipulating me. Meanwhile my sister is knitting blankets and buying outfits. How can I make a choice for myself when I feel absolutely alone??"
What did I do wrong?,"When avengers endgame came out I asked this girl who I was really good friends with if she wanted to watch it with me. She said yes and we agreed on a date. Note: prior to this we always texted and snapped each other regularly. The day before, she canceled with me in favor of some other guy who asked her to go a day earlier than our planned day. I, as the understanding friend, relieved a deep sigh and simply accepted my defeat. I was definitely disappointed but no hatred ever came out. I simply said, “oh,ok. Hf then. Don’t spoil the movie”. After that, things started to go down hill. 2 days after, I asked “wyd”... opened message, no response. *this is on Snapchat rn btw* a couple weeks later I try to spark up a conversation. Same thing, opened message but no response.... weeks go by and I simply stopped trying to make a conversation. I still keep a streak with this girl but, that’s it. 

Did I do something wrong? Did I mess up somewhere? Please help me find the answer.
Much appreciated:)"
how can i help my female friend whose period is late calm down?,"so basically, my friend's period is late (by like 10 days) and i want to help her calm down by getting a test (pregnancy) for her since im like 90% sure she ain't pregnant (she didn't have sex) and her body is just messed up.

i don't know how to go about it. im 15 and she's 16 there's no way we can just go buy a test without being weird and i don't think my or her parents will help us without scolding us a lot (since mine already did this before i don't want to disappoint them) 

what should i do? please help im very lost"
I really like a girl but i don't know what to do,"So there's this girl ive known for years shes so sweet funny a total joy to be around and so beutiful I sometimes just get lost in her eyes when we make eye contact. I want to make her the happiest girl around and pick her up when she's felling low and put her before me and give her all the love she deserves even though I'm not sure its humanly possible to give her all the love she deserves.
And I love making her smile. She has such a pretty smile. I want to hold her in my arms underneath the light of every star in the sky and make her feel like the luckiest girl in the world.
She is so amazing it's hard to do her justice just typing it out but I really think I could make her so happy given the chance and I'm hoping you glorious people can help me out I don't know how to get this amazing girl."
Feel bullied by parents,"Here is some background: i am a preteen going into 7th grade. my parents are divorced and have split custody. I see them each half the week. My mother has a boyfriend who I will refer to as R, who is very close to my brother, S. I have always been close to my dad and go to him for advice but I am being kept at my moms house for later explained reasons. 

 R and S have always been fans of teasing me. In the beginning it was okay but became personal. I told them it makes me feel upset but they continue. R is a believer in tough love and thinks I'm too sensitive. S is sexist towards me and this behavior is encouraged by R. Many times have I told my mother about this but she is too engaged in her phone to even hear me. Today I tried to bring it up to them as a group. R dismissed my feelings quickly. This is another thing they like doing a lot. I'm very sensitive and any time I cry or get upset they yell at me and berate me for being sad. My mother has threatened to hit me before just for crying when she yells at me. Well because of my sensitivity I started crying and they yelled at me. I told them I wanted to go to my dads house and they said I have to stay here and are not letting me leave. My mother even said I'm taking things too personally and overreacting and she yelled at me so now I'm hiding in the bathroom where they can not yell at me.

 I feel so ganged up on, mistreated, and bullied. I feel helpless to express my feelings to them and need advice on how to move forward in this situation."

I need a little help,Hi I’m Bella and I’m a 19 year old girl from England. The reason that I’ve decided to join this site is because I have some issues that I don’t want to bother friends or family with because I don’t want them to worry. Recently I’ve been having some issues socially and quite frankly I’m lonely. I’m usually generally a happy person but being on my own brings me down very low and right now I do feel as though I’m completely on my own and detached from the rest of the world. From a young age I have had problems with fitting in and making friends. These problems have came and went over the years but I always felt as though as I got older these issues would fade and I would find myself some how. I have now reached the age of 19 and I still have very little confidence and I feel as though I am missing out on things that other people my age are enjoying. I constantly beat myself up for not putting myself out there and making friends but I simply don’t know how to. I always have this anxiety around people not liking me and preferring it if I wasn’t there. I feel as though my lack of confidence puts people off being around me and makes them feel uncomfortable but this thought once again just makes me even less confident. It’s starting to really piss me off tbh just taking about it now. I just wanna get on with my life and enjoy it how I should be but I just don’t know how to. Any advice or anything just to make me feel less alone with this would be very helpful! :)
I'm getting irritated with my mom who has stage 4 breast cancer for over 3years now,"I was 19 when I dropped out from college was on my 3rd year. I dropped out because we found out that my mom was sick. She's in abroad because she's supporting us, 3siblings, separated parents she's the only one who has been supporting us ever since my parents separated. By the time I was on my 3rd year college my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer had to stop whatever I had starter to come here in Abroad to work to support my mom. 2 years later we're all here now. I'm a middle child by the way 22 years old. My mom is still here in abroad. She isn't work she's just with us. I have 2 brothers, youngest brother has a son by 17, he's 20 now, older brother 23 but alot happened to him too went to college and got wasted and everything anyways that's in the past now but all I can say was he was dumb and feeling rich kid. 
Anyways I'm developing this irritating and annoyed feelings towards my mom. I'm starting to get annoyed with how she constantly complains about what she feels, the sound, the pain. It's pissing me off. It's mean I know but sometimes it's just really annoying. It feels like you've been working for nothing since she isn't improving. I sometimes feel like maybe it's better if mom just rest for good, it's not something I want to happen but I just wanna live my life and go on with it. I'm tired not just physically but emotionally too plus psychologically. I know she feels more than that too. Can anyone please tell me what to do or explain what I'm feeling? I don't wanna have any regrets when something happens and I'm upset and everything. I love my mom so much more than I could ever love myself but sometimes I wish things isn't as complicated as this. Please enlighten me thank you."
How to interact with my uneducated relatives if my view of life after studying in the USA has completely changed and totally differs from them.,"I grew up in a second world country which is now basically a third world one, people are mostly doing bad, poor,  uneducated, very conservative. Country is religiously diverse, however my ethnicity and relatives(around 500 people) are muslims and extremely conservative and soviet type of thinking(don’t excel, don’t study, don’t think differently, etc.) 
Now, I was always a boy, who was sensitive, weak but enjoying the books. My father managed to send me to the USA at the age of 15 to come back with a bachelor’s in robotics. This is sort of background. I totally differ from teenagers in my homecountry and think differently than most of the people home in terms of dietary guidelines, political views, tolerance opinions and religious points. I do not think that women are worse than men. I do not think that LGBT community needs to be tortured and slaughtered. I do not think that animals are treated the way they should(i am a vegan). I have long hair and like to tie it in a bun. I do not like to fight with other males my age for the status of dominance or any other reasons, however I am not physically weak anymore. Etc., etc. 
Now, the question is how to convince myself that I am no better in any way than them and interact with them as if i consider them equal to me intellectually? I know I might sound arrogant and i want to know what to do about. How to properly talk with my people in order to not get my ass kicked?
What to not say?
Should I mention that I have learnt a new language( I will be in Costa Rica so they are going to be hear about it).
Thanks for attention!!!"
Kinda hate living w/ my mom,"So hear me out I have reasoning. Basically my mom is over religious to the point it’s almost like a cult. So I’m an agnostic/atheist now but I still haven’t told my mom, because if I did she’d go ballistic. But that’s not my main problem. She rejects common logic to the to the point where it’s really annoying. So to give an example from earlier today, my sister made a joke about anti-vaxxers. My moms not a hardcore anti-vaxxer but she responded with something along the lines of, “You don’t need vaccines as long as you have faith in god.” My sister told her actual evidence and my mom neglected it. I know this really isn’t that bad but there’s more. She will physically abuse us and say we deserved it for minor things and tell us that “we’re not pleasing god.” She tells my siblings and I how much of a disappointment we are because we’re slightly overweight. She has kicked me out of the house multiple times even though I’m a minor. After doing all of this she’ll lecture us on how we’re wrong and we need to apologize. (Sorry for bad grammar I’m on mobile)"
Tips for sneaking out,So I’m not allowed to go out ( I got in trouble) and there is a prom after party so I need tips how to sneak out without getting caught ! My escape route is my window which is right next to my bed and I plan on being back by 3 am
I don't know what to do,"Hello people, it's my first post on Reddit, I'm not very used to the platform so, forgive me if I don't know how to use it very well.
I need advice, I'm desperate because I had never had such a situation before... And I sincerely would appreciate someone who could tell me what to do in this scenario. It may sound childish, but it's a deep wound for me.
Backstory: on October last year I started going out with this girl (who was a friend of mine, and my reduced circle of friends) and I had a great time. Things were fun for me, and I got to spend lots of good memories with her. I was happy enough, but noticed some discomfort in her behavior when trying to be a couple with her. She always excused herself in the ""I don't know how to express my emotions"" scheme, and I bought it. I must admit that at this time I had some depression and was toxic to her at times, but tried always to correct myself from that. And also, she dumped her problems with me, to which I tried my best to help her, as I thought that is what a good couple does. Time passed and she became more cold with me, until she broke up with me on December. I was really disheartened because of my low self esteem, thinking that it was my fault for not being enough for her. Yet, we remained as friends.
Later, in a friendly talk (I remained interested in her, despite knowing she might not) she explicitly told me that the reason she broke up with me was because she was interested in another guy (I don't know who, maybe one of her old friends) and that she was really confused at the time, so she decided to break up to clarify her mind. I reacted surprised and upset at this, but decided to still give a shot to the girl as I profoundly wanted to be with her.
This lead to us coming back on February, now with a more mature me knowing more about her attitude and what I didn't like. The first days came good, but as soon as we reached the first week she went back to her old shitty attitude. I still liked her but craved for attention and affection. One day she told me in one of the ""she dumps her shit on me"" talks we had, that she had manipulated one of her close friends deliberately, and kind of non regretful. This was kind of a red flag, but I couldn't or didn't pay attention at the time.
Later on I got fed up with our relationship, but decided I could still give it a shot if we were willing to change. So, I told her about what was I uncomfortable with, and what I needed, and so did she. Not even one day passed before she texted me asking to explain myself, because appearently my talk wasn't clear enough for her, even though I tried to make it the clearest possible. Just two days after that she came back with a response saying that ""she understands, but doesn't know what to do"" thing. I just said that it would be fine as long as she did something. Which happened. For a day. Just one day.
And, at this point my heart was stabbed. It had happened not just once, nor twice, but THREE TIMES. I ended our lovers relationship, but said that we should continue friendship (as I have a limited group of friends, losing one is devastating).
This last part happened over a month ago.
Oh, I forgot to mention that we also had talks where she would start talking toxically, and this time I was more severe and just told her what I considered the truth, but in a harsh way.
The story: during this month I have found out a lot of things about the relationship, about myself and I grew to like another girl (one of our mutual friends). I thought of my ex mature enough to understand that we would just be friends. So I told her that I started liking someone (I didn't tell her who, not to hurt her... This recoiled later). And... After some days, she texted me telling me that she wanted not to be friends with me anymore. She didn't state why, but I accepted it. I asked if it was because I told her I liked someone else, and she immediately went berserk on me. She jumped on my throat, telling me all my flaws, calling me a motherfucker for having played with her feelings, and treating her badly. To which I exploded and told her all I felt. All the resentment I had, I spoiled it all over her face. She told me that she still liked me, and I couldn't buy it at all... And then... She gave me a very hard blow. She stated that this was the end of all forms of relationship with me, and said that it will be my fault what will happen to our friends... And, as they're the only ones I have... I fear that I might be left alone again. And I'm scared of that, and I feel guilty for it... Can someone tell me what to do in this scenario? I can't bear with it"

I haven't seen her in 3 years & I finally did at the airport when she flew back to our home country. She was flying back to her hometown & was transitting through the city I lived in. She told me to meet up with her again on her way back to uni as she will be staying overnight at a hotel in the city I live in before flying international the next day. That was on a Friday night when I went to spend the night with her at her hotel room. I brought wine & pizza & was hoping for a girls night. But she invited her other f-buddy to come over for sex & she asked to me wait outside while she did him. I sat by the pool for over 1hr & was annoyed but still waited. Later that night she told me she got tickets to a club to watch a show & said she had a good guy friend (I'll just call him Jake) coming to pick us up. I agreed to go coz I never party, I'm not that kinda girl but I justed wanted to have some fun & live a little so I agreed. Fast forward I got super drunk & my friend said she'd look out for me. She couldn't be really drunk coz she had a flight the next day. Anyways I ended up going back to the hotel room with a friend of Jake that I briefly met. I don't remember how he brought me back to my friend's hotel room coz I was out. But I do remember waking up unconsciously & realizing he had me on the bed with my legs up & I realized he took down my trousers half way so I was half naked. I didn't see my friend, I think she let Jake's friend take me back coz I must've passed out. I felt pain in my lower abdomen, I think Jake tried to have sex with me & I drunkenly blurted out it hurts. Next thing I remember him telling me to pull up my pants & roll over the bed to sleep. I don't know of that was sex coz I am a virgin. Next morning I woke up hungover & saw that my friend had returned with Jake & Jake's friend was asleep on the floor. I had to sober up so I fumbled around the room looking for water then passed out on the floor. Jake's friend moved over to where I was laying & fingered me & I made a noise so he removed his hands from my pants. My friend & Jake were on the bed.

After I left my friend I was so confused. I don't know if I wanted that. I felt violated & I have no one to talk to coz I am deeply embarrassed. I don't know if that was sec coz I've never had sex. And how am I supposed to know if he came in me. In my country, having pre-matiral sex is heavily frowned upon & is a taboo. Please I need advise it has been a week & I feel like I could just die coz the guilt & shame is so unbearable."
Feelings for both of us,"Feel kinda weird posting on here- anyways, I’m 15, and just moved to League City TX. started started at a new school about a month ago, and on the second day of starting school, I met this one super cool girl. We’ve been talking since, but one thing to note is she has a boyfriend. This dude barely gives her any attention, (even though it may be unintentional), barely hangs out with her, and hasn’t been there for her much– on the other hand, here I’ve been, trying to show how much I care, respect her, and support her. She says she “needs” to be with him. She said it herself though, we talk more than she does with him.
    So last night was this play-thing I went to to support her, because she never said anything about her boyfriend being there— (we had already talked about this happening weeks im advance), and so as I’m chilling at the table waiting for it to start, her boyfriend walks in and sits right near me. Keep in mind, he barely knows I exist. 
    As you can tell things weren’t about to go smoothly, because she knew I liked her & that she had slight feelings for me as well. After the play, she comes off the stage and hugs her boyfriend right in front of me, since I was literally right there. Something hit me at that moment and I realized I liked her more than I thought because I pretty much bawled my eyes out afterwards. So I had to walk out of the school without even getting to congratulate her. I didn’t because I didn’t want to make anything suspicious / out of respect for him & her.
   The same night at around 8:00pm, she texts and asked if I was alright. I was blunt and told her no, and she responded with a ton of empathetic & meaningful I’m so sorrys— she didn’t know he would be there. But I had to tell her how I felt, so I said it. “Maybe we should pump the breaks. I’m really into you, and I’d rather not be the one lurking behind you & him for months at a time as y’all keep getting closer, and then get too attached. I honestly care for you a lot, and I want to be with you. Just let me know how you feel.” — she responds with something along the lines of “I want to be him but I also want to be with you, idk it’s just really confusing.” I told her to give it time, but honestly I don’t know if I can wait much longer knowing they’re in a relationship right now.

   I need some advice right now. I’m having trouble even starting a convo with her again because I don’t know what to say— I’d be super stoked if anyone could help, thanks"
M 19 still out of high school still idk what to do,"19 graduated high school , work a shit job where I get no hours, want to go to school but idk it’s a lot of money also not sure what for ? Also struggling with girls , I usually am good at talking to them and starting convos with no cringe talk or sexual comments but they still don’t like me any advice would be great. :) "
Why am I so tired and unmotivated!?,"Aye what’s up so I’m 17 and I’m actually doing pretty good mentally, like I feel pretty happy where as I normally don’t but it’s weird because even though I feel happy I’m extremely tired no matter how much I sleep I’m tired and I just wanna sleep all day and all night I’m that tired, I have zero energy and I’m unmotivated. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed by any means because I do feel happy! I’m really confused. I’m taking vitamins and vitamin d supplements because I went to my doctor and they said it’s bevause my vitamin d is low but I’ve been on these supplements for two weeks now and if anything I feel more tired. "
"Silly, but I could use some social skills help","Basically here is some information you'll need to know:
- I'm super outgoing, I can get along with everyone(my age or like just a teen or something?)
- I have terrible social anxiety when it comes to adults the monotone in people's voice just freaks me out and it's unsettling to just hold a conversation

Knowing those things, we move onto the actual problem
I like this boy, he's not the best at social skills and he mainly conveys his conversations with memes and jokes. But when he is genuinely seriously he can have a pretty serious conversation, and he is so smart on so many things. And I want to talk to him, I want to ask him so many questions but I get such a block. And I feel like it's because of his mental illness, no its not that I'm unable to look past it or something before someone says it lol. I love and care about every piece of him, but no feel like no topic is good enough to catch his attention or will not make him freak. I just don't know what to do, what to ask, how to learn about him!

I sincerely just want to ask him things that he won't find stupid and small, I want a serious conversation something that can drive us closer or something. I'm trying to see if I can somehow get him alone in person? Maybe he's just a bad texter idk but I'm just super anxious. Àny opinions?
(Thank you for reading lmao)"
I need some advice,Yesterday i bunked school cause i did not study for an exam which was optional but my mother forced me to take it so i went to the park nearby and then today she found out so she completely insulted me calling me a fucktard and then she said she would kill herself and then said if someone with fape me and then said i dont need university and i should stay locked up in my room cause she dosent trust or love me anymore and called me an asshole and a fucking moron and this time she started hitting herself in front of me and this isnt the first she sweared at me she started swearing at me since i was 12 when i got a B in physics she also publicly humiliates me and on the other hand my dad is not saying anything acting like he us cool and says that im hopeless and i should just get married after school. My mom said i should just crush my life cause i dont have one now and so my depreesion has just added on as i kept enduring her harsh words where at this time i dont care what happens to me anymore. And the worst part is that my final exams are no less than 10 days and i have just given up in life now just like my parents did but u really am passionate of getting into a good university and becoming a successful architect but i dont know anymore sometimes my parents make me feel that i was a mistake the only reason for my happiness is my grandmother so i just keep crying in my room in the dark and now i really dont care what happens to me 
My crush vs friends,"I have a lot of mutual friends... I also have this crush, I had a boyfriend for 1 month in the past and it ended because of problems. So I basically know nothing about love. This new crush is not the best looking, not always well known, and not an ideal bf or crush type. All of my friends just “ship him with me” but then also they are only excited since I’m knows to be dull and not very emotional. I know for certain he’s a nice person, he’s super funny, sweet, and just great overall.  I have most of the day with him and that’s also a big factor. I’m probably really obvious. So back to my friends, on the other hand they don’t really know him. You know how girls and guys have different friend groups (I’m not very popular). He also has this “girl” friend that he can talk with for fun. I’m super jealous not gonna lie. One friend of mine asks “what do you see in him?” Another says “it’s cute and all but are you sure it’s him?”. And lots of them judge me for liking this guy, they say stupid things like “he is crazy”(tbh everyone is crazy) and some even say “His nose is weird or something.” Excuse me what? His nose changes everything? What I would like to say is, “Your not that good yourself. You have lots of pimples and a bit of acne. It’s obvious you wear makeup. Your personality isn’t the best, sometimes your like those bratty popular girls. You try to show off but also nobody notices, You make fun of me everyday.” I know what some might think, this is VERY long and she’s a fake friend. Well I just keeps some people for company or support. Well anyways I just want to know what some people think in this situation or have any advice? Should I stop liking him, am I really in love? Should I stand up to them? What should I do, I really don’t like when he’s made fun of. Especially by my friends."
HELPPPP,"Ok, so I used to go out with someone I would call D.H  for the sake for privacy (not that it matters).  We ""loved"" each other.  And I quote that because I really loved him but the things that he do never showed it. There was so many other things that was a red flag to leave him but I never listened. For example, this is the worse he's done to me,  it might not sound like much but it really hit close to home.  When I would be hanging with my friends after school, he would never tag along even after we ALL begged and begged he LITERALLY said he'd rather play games 😒. So I left him. It was sad but it had to he done.  What's the point of being together if he won't even take time out of his day to talk to me? After that,  I found someone new. I'll call him F. D. When we started dating, the very next day D.H went up to me and told me not to date F.D and to be with him instead.  I WAS SHOOK. And at that time,  I still had feelings for D. H because the reason we broke up in the first place was because he didn't act like we really loved me when I knew for a fact that I did.  So,  I broke up with F.D and went with D.H to give him another chance. He was a better person but I started to hang out with F.D again and.... cheated.  I didn't mean to but since I'm still a virgin,  all we did was makeout. So now I'm in this situation where I like both of them.  After a while,  D.H started acting the same as last time (acting like he didn't like me) and I started to hear rumors that he was gay.  It's probably not true but people are still talking about it to this day.  Personally,  I think he's bisexual because of ""things I saw him do""with other guys 🤣and plus he dated a lot of girls.  When my friend said something about his ex, he got really mad and it bothered me that he still cares about her. I can't tell who broke up with who this time because I was talking to my friend and I told her to ask him if we should brake up because I'm a pussy🤣.  He said yea so it was official.  We were broken up now.  Fast forward 1 year later I'm talking to him again but as friends and it's gonna stay that way.  You know that one ex you will never loose feelings for?  Yea he's one of mine.  And I can tell he still likes me too.  I sometime catch him staring at me but I ignore and try not to make eye contact and he smile A LOT when he's around me( I know it sounds creepy 🤣) . Now, F.D is back in my life and he's asking to get back with me but my friends think I'm over him but to tell the truth,  I'm not over him either.  I'm a WHOLE mess 🤣🤣🤣😢.  So they keep telling him to stop asking me out but I'm sitting there next to them hella happy and wishing I had the guts to tell my friends that I do like him and want to go back out with him.  My situation is so bad.  Any advise?  🤔🤔(Sorry it was so long) "
So many bodies..,"Hello its @Fluffabug F19, I recently got into a bit of an argument with my new friend/soon to be Fuckbuddy
    We've taken our new friendship into the sexual realm which was what we've both been wanting, last night we were playing 21 questions and I obviously asked him what his body count was and he was hesitant. He proceeded to say it's pretty high, again I asked him what it was and he says 20+... Um excuse me 👀. I was so taken back of course. Coming from a VIRGIN yes a virgin this really shocked me, I didn't know what to say or feel to be honest. I knew he was experienced but not that much !! Shit I thought it was like 5-8 maybe even 10 but not that high. We talked this over and told each other how we felt and everything is well and dealt with between us now but here's the thing... I don't know how to feel? On I've hand I feel like another number on a sex list when giving away my first time. (Additional info- I've never dated, had my first kiss, nothing I mean literally nothing man.) So giving him my v card away is a huge deal for me. 
On the other I don't really care because it's his sex life and he's allowed to do whatever he pleases.  I'm emotionally constipated and I don't know how to make it come out 😅. My question, what would you do in my shoes?  A virgin willing to give away to him until she finds out his body count? Please help any advice will do, Thank you 😅 🙏🏻✨"

Is it alright for a 15M to have a wall full of posters?,"My family recently moved in an apartment and I have put up a lot of posters from my passions (guitar, rock, soccer and basketball) To the extent that one of my walls is fully covered. Ik i am reaching an age where i can start hosting parties or invite people over. Would it be alright to still have posters when starting to become an adult. I really like the way it looks but if it means i will be made fun of or miss out on opportunities with the ladies i am willing to stick to a more ""boring"" theme."
Alarms,"I sleep through my alarm almost everyday I set multiple in hopes it will wake me up but I’ll straight up sleep through all them I might hear one and asleep press snooze and then sleep through the rest. But if I place my alarm further away I ain’t gonna hear it at all everyone else in the house hears it but I don’t I’ll sleep right through them any tips? Any advice on what I can do and it’s not like I’m lacking sleep I get a solid 8-9 hours 

Edit: I feel like this might be part that i was extremely tired last night since we did have a long holiday break and I was staying up late that whole week but it makes no sense it feels like the day I didn’t sleep at all (yesterday) because I couldn’t sleep since my sleep schedule was so used to going to bed at 4-5am  I fell asleep at 5 and woke up at 6 for school 
But today and every other day I just straight up sleep through my alarms and sometimes it says I snooze it but I have no memory of snoozing my alarm especially today "
Teen advice please,"So... I’m 15 and a guy, and I’m just gonna list a couple “situations” I got and if anyone could help that’d be awesome. 

Okay so one - I am like afraid to masturbate, idk why but I just feel guilty, I watch porn but always stop before I nut. Anyway I could overcome this?

Two, I don’t mean to sound like a dick, but people say I’m pretty good looking and some of the girls I talk to are pretty cute and I would like to date one. My only problem is I feel like it would be really awkward to date around my parents, is that weird or what... 

well that’s all I got for now, pls help :p"
My parents might get divorced,"So my parents have been fighting for probably three or four years. Before it was because my mom thought he was flirting with other people and for a time, he left the house at night and didn’t come home till one or two in the morning. He also drinks every night. I don’t think he’s an alcoholic or anything but he drinks a little beer or wine every single day. Then my dad got sick. Life threateningly sick. And through that my mom stayed by him. During his recovery, they were on good terms and I thought things were getting better. But then my brother, who is in middle school right now, started being so rude. Every day my parents would be so stressed out because of him. He was talking back and wasn’t helping around the house. He was so incredibly rude. They told me hey were getting divorced three times already over the past four years. And now my brother is stressing them out. Recently, my brother was being really messy and my parents were yelling at him to clean up. But he didn’t. After thirty minutes he still didn’t. That’s when my dad got mad. But my mom is always on my brothers side. She said that’s he’s going through a stage. But my dad didn’t agree. So he left. He went to my relative’s house. And he said he’s not coming back to our house unless my mom goes. It’s either him or her. I think this time they’re actually getting divorced. And I really don’t want that to happen. I’m in high school so I’m going to be applying to college soon. I know financially we are going to be strained. And I don’t want to move between houses. We’ve been living in our house for half of my life. I love my neighborhood so much it’s beautiful and safe. We’re not rich, but we’re well off. I don’t know what to do. I hate crying when I hear them fighting, but I love having a family that isn’t broken apart. "
What do you think?,"Hi guy’s I always feel depressed but when I search for the symptoms I don’t usually fall under any category,I have a friend,okay right here some of you would think I’m jelous or whatever.But the truth is I want my friend’s to excel or even do better than me,but it’s so painful when they put zero effort and I worked but butt of only to be in one position,back to my friend,Anytime we go to class she gets high marks than me I’ll be like cool,my teachers award marks randomly,but every time it’s always the same story why can’t I be lucky at least just once,I’m not bluffing y’all,most times people that I’m better than perform lower than me also,must times I’m always the unlucky one even non academically,apart from this my friend in junior and high school i had the same problems I always never had luck,till today I feel like just giving up,I don’t know what else to do,I’m crying writing these things,every one thinks I’m fine but no area of my life is balanced I’m loosing all hopes,I’ve prayed also but it all seems to be getting worse."
I SWEAR I'M STRAIGHT,"Good day fellas. So, there's this girl I'm friends with who likes me but I swear I'm straight. I mean I actually support LGBT rights, I'm an heterosexual ally. It's not the first time someone with the same sex told me the liked in a totally not platonic way and I'm starting to get bothered that I'm turning into a magnet thing or something. That'll be very unpleasant for me to be. I don't want our friendship to be awkward but I really wanna reject her because I cant just tell her to wait(for nothing). Please tell me what to do with this situation and what to tell her. Thank you so much."
How to know if a girl lost interest in you?,Pretty much what the title says. What are some signs that she lost interest in you?
"I (31F) am going to tell my sweet, although very socially awkward coworker that his body odor requires him to wear deodorant tomorrow, how can I soften the embarrassment for him?","As the title says any advice would be welcome, I have no intention of wording it to him like this. I’m not sure what I’m going to say actually, I could probably go to my manager about it but I know I’m closer to him then most and I feel it would be better coming from me. He’s been homeschooled his entire life and from what he’s told me I have an incredibly strong feeling his parents have simply never gone over the importance of personal hygiene. 
So what can I say or at least how might I initiate this conversation?

He’s 18"
This guy wants my number but I don’t want to give it to him,So this guy (16 m) at my school gave me (15 f) this letter on Wednesday basically declaring his love for me but I had only known him for a couple of weeks and even then we didn’t talk that much. So I told him that I didn’t feel the same way and he said ok. Now he’s asking me for my number but I don’t want to give it to him. How do I explain that to him?
Ok so I need some help,"I'm in high school grade 10 if that matters. And I've liked this girl for a really Long time and we've dated from before and I've never been able to get over her. I told her how I feel and she says she still loves me but she wants to stay as we are which is really close friends cause she Doesn't wanna ruin what we have.

So like what do I do I wanna be with her but idk where to go from here. Thanks in advance for anyone who reads this and replies"
I really like this guy...,"I met a guy I really like at a party but the first time I met him I was drunk and very clingy (he called me clingy to a friend that also happened to be his) and I was hugging him around the waist all night ... now we are friends and go to the same parties occasionally and talk sometimes at them but I still really like him, however he likes another girl who he’s linking with but she says she’s not quite ready for a relationship with him (I just know this the girl and I aren’t friends). I’m so embarrassed and I wanna go out with him but I think I’ve ruined my chances, what do I do?"

Someone fucking help me!!!!!!! 
I can't fucking sleep.
So much of shit going through my mind. 
I fucking hate this college's faculty members,all of them are a bunch of refined assholes. I can't believe its 4 am in the morning and I've been trying to sleep from like 1'o clock.For three hours I can't sleep,holy shit. What is wrong with me???? 
I hate this system, I hate this society and I also hate brutal reality of life. All of them is giving me anxiety. What if I have a back in one of the subjects? , what if I don't have enough money to even support my parents? The fucking truth is I don't want to be like those fucking nerds who think that there is nothing greater than knowledge and are constantly perusing every book in the course in stead of ""just chillin"". I fucking hate that. Now I know that whatever they are doing right now will get them a better job than me, and its probably going to be them the world will actually give a shit about. Me?  I'm just waiting for life to give me an unexpected turn that might change my fortune, but the truth is that is not going to happen. O god why is this world so depressing ???Why am I sent here??  I think I should stop writing this shit now....."

My parents don’t like my best friend,"So recently I wrote a post about how I wasn’t talking with my best friend anymore and I deleted that because we talked about it and we are friends again.

We weren’t friends for a while because she had the keys to my house and when we were vacationing with my family she came in the house with other people and my parents found out about it.

Now they don’t want me to be friends with her. And I know what she did was wrong but we have been friends for years and she is like a sister to me and I don’t want to end my relationship with her.But I don’t know how to hang out with her without telling my parents every time.

I seriously don’t know what to do"
not having a best friend,"So I have really really close friends. I was so quick to call people my “best friend” in middle school and freshmen year and they ended up leaving me. Today, I have a group of friends whom I’m very close with. I see that X and Y (example) are best friends, and I also see that A and B ( again example) are best friends. I do love my close friends but I feel like there’s nobody who’s actually my ride or die or anybody who actually connects to me. It feels lonely. Everyone has a best friend, it seems to be a great thing. Am I wrong?"
Pregnancy.,"My girlfriend was on the pill for a few months in order to regulate her periods. She stopped taking them the last week of May. She got her period the last week of June. We fooled around in the shower around July 5, however I didn’t not go inside of her. I am worried about ‘pre-cum’ and that issue. She is 2 days late (usually stars the 25 and it’s the 27) she also says she feels weird. Please give any clarifications and advice, thank you."
HELP ME PLEASE,"Hi, I’m 15 and I’ve known this girl for about 4 years, we are very close and we have never hung out in real life before other than at school.  I want to ask her to hang out sometime, how should I approach this? Help me.

She talks to like 4 other guys on and off but isn’t that close to them, She is comfortable enough to where she can open up to me when she is going through stuff, I am the one who is there to support. She has been there for me when I vent to her about personal things and when I went though family stuff. I trust her a lot.
I like her but some of my friends that I’ve known for a long time seem to like her too, they hit on her and they try and be obnoxiously funny around her and I think they only like her for her body. She’s one of those people who is really nice to people so she doesn’t really notice.  I DON’T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS. 

She’s sent mixed signals to me over the time I’ve known her, we are at the point where we can talk almost about anything openly to each other without it being weird. 
I don’t know what to do about all of this, some of her friends have also said that we would be “cute together” because we have a similar kind of personality. Should I open up to her and tell her how I feel about her because this has been bugging me for a while, I could use any advice. Ask questions too!

Feeling Trapped in my house and Life,"I am 18. I live with my mother, my step father and my baby brother (5 years old). I absolutely have no relationship with anyone in my house. I play and talk to my brother sometimes when we aren't disagreeing but i HATE my mother and her disgusting husband. I am not ever able to leave my house (babysitting and my family is downright broke plus i have no friends) and for weeks at a time i have no communication with the outside world. I dont have a phone (computer) and all i do all day is overthink , stare in space, take care of my brother like he is MY child and wish i could somehow end it all. I FEEL SO TRAPPED in the house as if the walls are caving in on me everyday. Im loosing my mind. I am going to college soon hours away from home . It is my only hope to get away from my suffocating household"
I am longing for a bf,"I'm 15 but I'm really mature for my age. When I say a bf I wouldn't date anyone who I couldn't imagine marrying. However I would never be allowed to date in a million years and I don't exactly live somewhere booming with eligible bachelors. I wouldn't be allowed to date anyway, well I have never been told but u know when u can just tell. I'mnnot allowed to go out to discos or what not tho frankly they r just orgies so I don't really have any way of meeting anyone because I also go to an all girls' school."
Need some advice...,"So I'm a high school guy that's absolutly an anti-social nervous wreck most of the time, but the past year I've really tried to be more outgoing andput myself out there. At the beginning of the last school year, my junior year, I asked a friend, who I've known since kindergarten and the couple years before started to have feelings for, out to a concert, not on a date, but with a group. First of all, she texted me later and said no. It kinda hurt, but that wasn't really the problem. All school year she was friendly once and awhile, but usually tried to ignore me. I even asked her if I had done something wrong, and she couldn't even look at me as she no and ran off. Long story short, we're not as close and I got over it. 

Now, a year later, there's one other girl who just graduated that I know and really like. We've talked a few times, we go to the same church/youth group, like the same stuff/hobbies, but while everyone I've talked to said the first time want my fault, I'm afraid of I try to talk to her or anything I'll ruin it as soon as she figures it out. 

It sucks cause I'm not known for being outgoing in my small high school and people seem to act like it's weird when I'm anything but shy. How do I get to know her better and eventually let her know how I feel without coming off as weird?"

Jerks,"I have to go after school to my dad's work. There is this one jerk named Josh and he has a ""goon"" named Grady. Josh and Grady are more jerky when my brother isn't around, but still are jerky. Josh is the main jerk and Grady is a decent person when he isn't around.

I hate my dad?,"I really hate my dad. Its more like i have grown to not like him?

I'm the only female and middle child to an asian family. I have two brothers one older and one younger as well as half siblings (they dont live with us). My parents are still together.

My dad isnt entirely bad. he works full time to provide me with as much stuff as possible and take us on holidays and helps us learn about our asian cultures as well as other cultures. He shows that he tries and everything.

It kinda started around the start of secondary school when I realised how I felt. My dad has always been extremely controlling, he doesnt like to take anything from anyone, and hes always been strict. 

It first started off with little things, like for example, i was never allowed skirts, make up, a phone (i did for a while but not now), a boyfriend all the usual things. he used to jokingly make jokes about the not having a boyfriend when i was younger.

The thing is as i grew older I started seeking a little bit more independance, like wanting to go out with my friends without having to constantly check in like every 30 mins or being able to be trustworthy of things. By the time, I realised that my dad was already used to me being controlled in a sense? i never used to talk back to him or go against him or anything.

One example of him being controlling was my first boyfriend. i mean i realise he was stupid now, and i appreciate the concern and stuff, but the intent he had i was bothers me. a few months ago i was in a relationship with him and i intended to tell my parents. Back then i thought he was a genuinely nice guy and my parents could probably like him.

when my dad found out he immediately made me break up with him over text and smashed my phone. he blocked him on every social media and stopped me from attending the youth group that we met in. he threatened that if i didnt, he would go over there and smash his face in. it had turned out that my dad had spoken shit about me to his parents so that they would enforce this too.

obviously i was terrified and in tears, so i did as he said and i missed out about 4 months if this group and it absolutely killed me. i loved this group and the friends i made in it and all. i was so angry, but he kept explaining that its for the best, its his job to be protective and that we're in an asian house then whatever he says goes.

that was the first time that i ever said i hated him. not because of the boyfriend but because of how he handled everything.

another time was when my brother refused to go to university cause he wanted to pursue a piloting career. he made mistakes along the way but my dad was always there to shove his morale underground. he would always say shit like how he is going the wrong way and that he will never make it and things like that.

ive never accepted anyone making my brothers upset so i snapped.

i shouted how its not fair for him to be like that and he took it out on my and immediately cut off everything like internet and youth groups because i said something against his opinion

it came to the point where i packed my bags and threated (i was going to go through with it) and run away to stay at a nearby friend's house. he threated to call the police and put me into shit so i didnt go.

when it comes to arguements, he refuses to let anyone else talk. it always has to be 'his opinion is law'. ive never had freedom and its so hard to be the only kid who's never had outings with their friends, or the person whos limited on what they can wear, who they can be with and what they see.

its made me someone who is genuinely scared to let out my feelings and its so fucking shit. what do i do? am i supposed to feel this way? am i doing something wrong?"
[M15] Everything about life just kinda seems to suck. I'm almost confident but really I'm insecure that I'm just too sensitive and that I shouldn't make a big deal about what my life has been. Am I?,"When I was younger, I used to be very outgoing, but not very liked. I never had a lot of friends that I considered close. I went to elementary and middle school with very small group of kids (like 30 in the entire grade) and everyone knew each other very well. I never really established myself socially until middle school, and even then, I feel like most people just talked to me because they tolerated me compared to how annoying I was as a kid. A lot of those people were sereously toxic to me, and by last year (grade 9), I lost everyone that I could actually trust and tell my problems to, and I was around a lot of fake people that took advantage of me, and I kept everything in and I just grew angry at everything. I made a lot of mistakes and got taken advantage of really hard over a few years by a girl I thought I loved. Over the summer, I gained a lot of anger issues at home, and I got a really shitty outlook towards life. When high school began, I went to a high school that most of my other classmates didn't go to. For a while things got better, and I thought that my life would be diffirent. But over time I realized that I'm too reserved (socializing mentally drains me a lot, and I'm a very cringey / nerdy person when I'm really being myself) and I feel like none of the new people in my life are really my friends. I feel like when shit goes downhill, these people would leave me out to dry. All of my old classmates that I hear about are always doing better than me (popular, in a relationship, lots of friends, parties, genuinely happy, active social life) and it makes me feel really shitty. I promised myself that I would be way better off, and I am, but compared to everyone that I've been around most of my life, I seem like a complete loser. I blend in socially, and I have groups of friends that I can talk with and stuff, but I'm very smart (as in I get good grades with little effort), and that makes me stand out and come off as nerdy. I'm also p ugly and socially awkward, and it seems like everyone always likes me for my humor and awkwardness but doesn't appreciate me past that for who I am as a person, or the way I am. I defenitely have a social life outside of school, but it feels forced. I'm always the one making plans with others, and it's mostly the same people because In afraid to try to be better friends with others because I'm worried they'll bail on my plans, become fake friends, or worse like people in middle school would do to me. There's so many new attractive girls, and I feel like I'm too ugly and irrelevant to have a chance with any of them. I constantly feel under pressure to be succeeding more than these people that I used to know, or I'll be the same person I used to be. I feel like everyone else is out there having the time of their lives, and I'm just apart from them, being at home or being anti social. I'm not completely shy, and can be very confident and outgoing at times, but In not taken seriously in the way I want to be. I defenitely talk to people, and can tell that some genuinely like me, but I feel like it's the fake type like that people do to the advantage of you. I can't let go of the natural hate of people that I developed over the years, and I think it's really holding me back, along with stuff like social anxiety from being a better person.

I know this post had been a complete rollercoaster, and maybe it was mostly so I could rant everything out, because I don't trust anyone else enough to tell them what I just wrote. Whatever the case might be, I feel like I've been going through some tough times recently, and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice?"
Im really stressed,"So im 13 and i just got accepted into an advanced math class. At first i was fine but than we got double the homework than a regular class and its so hard on me. I know the material very well and im getting good grades but i just feel really stressed and i just started puberty, I cant relax at all. When I go home. One of my two friends moved and middle school feels like hell."
I have a Predicament,"Okay... I'll make it simple. I've been dating my girlfriend (we'll call her Jahna) for 8 months now, and I love her very much. Buttt my darned brain is screwing me up. It's insisting on keeping a crush on this girl (we'll call her Cassidy) that I liked before I started dating my girlfriend. Any advice?"
I need to find balance in life,"All my life I have been a good straight A student who never gets into trouble at school. I am currently in highschool and have a great passion for sports. This highschool I attend is much more prestigious than my elementary and middle school. I am currently in all honors and AP classes. They are getting to be extremely difficult and although I am not failing anything my grades are dropping from As to Bs. I know this may not sound bad to most people but my parents are extremely strict on this subject. They are blaming it on sports and are threatening to make me quit. I am working extremely hard to go to tutoring before practice after school but despite my best efforts my grades keep dropping. I don't know what to do anymore. I am constantly up till midnight or later with my work because I just don't understand it but my parents can't see that. They only see how ever since I joined a sport team my grades are dropping because I spend too much time with sports. 


Should I quit my sport ? How can I get my parents to see that I need balance in my life ? Although my grades are very important to me and always have been, how do I find the correct amount of time to spend with friends and to spend with academics?
"
Ho should I skip a class and is it acceptable?,"So on the next upcoming school day which is Monday since I'm on spring break me and my friend are going to skip a class to hangout in the library. I get good grades and I never have to worry about studying because learning comes easy to me. I am in all honors classes. The reason I am skipping is simply because I am bored with my life. I want some excitement. I was an introvert and socially awkward. Now I have mostly gotten rid of my constant blushing and awkwardness. Now onto my friend. He is always skipping class and school I guess because he would rather have a good time. He doesn't like his parents checking on him and is failing school. He is most likely staying back. Don't get me wrong, he a great person but simply doesn't care about school.  
My plan is to get an appointment with my guidance counselor so I can get a pass. Once I have said pass, I will calmy walk to the library which is en route to the guidance office. I have never been in major trouble before and have never broken any big rules. 
TL;DR What are some tips to skip class? What's the worst that could happen? Why should I not skip class?"
Need some help on meeting people,"So over this summer i have had a bit to much ""fun"". Overboard with the partying and going to house parties thing so my mom felt as it was best to send me to live with my dad for a bit. It has been fine i had no problem meeting new people, usually. But i just dropped out of high school as i needed to get a full time job to help with the bills and cost of living etc. I have no idea how i meet people now without going to school anymore. Just looking for advice on how to meet people as i just moved into a new city (the city is huge like biggest city in my state, Seattle if anyone was wondering). Any Advice is greatly appreciated."
Weight loss/gain help,"I'm 17 years old and I have noticed I've lost a lot of weight since I was maybe around 16. My arms are so skinny and I am around my neck, collar bones, Back and hips.
I don't have a problem with eating food. I eat loads of it. But sinces 16 I've been losing it very fast rather than putting any weight on. 
If I do manage to put any weight on its only on my stomach which annoys me alot.

Has anyone experienced this problem? Should I see a doctor? Both of my parents are getting worried about me."
"Reddit, i have an emergency and need help. I need to write an appeal letter for my reasonable absences. This can make or break me graduating.","Hello reddit! I am a senior in highschool and only have about a month of school left. But the problem is I have about 30 absences in two of my classes and 25 in the rest of my classes. This year has been hell for me and my family. My grandfather and aunt passed away and it really was a powerful blow for all of us. But before I make this a sob story I want to ask for help. I have a chance to graduate but I have to write an appeal letter for my school saying why I was absent and basically ask the principle to pass me for the year. I'm begging anyone out there to help me make a well written persuasive letter to him. The letter would include the following: -I was absent because of family death -my immune system is weak -I have many allergies such as; pollen, any seafood, and any nut. -Also I would have had a doctors note but I have to pay 20$ every time I go there and my family isn't exactly ""well off"". -I attended a Saturday attendance program for nine days which is used to recover absences. THANK YOU so much for anyone who chooses to help. Any help is appreciated.

Just realized I have no social life. Help?,"So, i'm a junior and go to an all boys school. My parents have been making me focus so hard on my school work that my social life is nonexistant

Do ypu know if it will hurt those chances?,"I really want my boyfriend to do well after college and highschool  so i hope he will get into a good college with a possible scholarship but will bad grades for the past smester hurt those chances?

I have like 3 friends max that i could do stuff with, but 2 of them are out of town and the other is always hanging out with other friends and doesn't have time for me.

i think my boyfriend might be into someone else what should i do?,"alright, first thing first, everytime i see him i always look like shit, maybe once or twice i actually looks presentable, but other than that i looked like a ferret (she never does...), but he seemed to enjoy my company, yknow? we did fun things like tickle fights or wrestling, etc,etc, but lately i noticed he hasn't really been into me all that much, i mean on facebook(its one of our only means of communication since we were caught making out on my bed and he was practically banned from my life by my step dad whos some ex drug addict and looks at me weird), he added this girl that i KNEW liked him and they seemed to always talk, and now, these days, every time i try to talk with him or tease him on msgs or status updates he ignores it or just says something irrelevant like 'derp' or 'whelp'
It makes me tear up inside and i start to wonder if maybe he was starting to loose interest in me because when they talk he always smiles and acts how he usually acts back when I was amusing (which was not that long ago... well it stopped when she came along) 
we use to make out every chance we had, but since the last i saw him when i tried to kiss him he'd do it quick and would pull away and pat me on the back and give me this weird half assed smile...
since he started showing interest in him ive gone into a huge mess of stress (still going through it ) where i stopped eating and stopped working out or caring about the way i looked and when we talk it just makes me feel worse and worse, i just want to confront him and ask him to limit his attention towards that girl, but at the same time i dont, because i dont want to seem like the jealous type, like my mom who yelled at my step for having an old friend from highschool on his facebook and beating him down for every chick who talks to him.

i dont know wether i should leave him or just deal with it and see how it turns out (she might take him if i do that though...) or if i should confront him about this mess and we'd have this huge make out session, but at the same time if i do that he's gunna think i dont trust him which i do! also everytime im around him i always feel so nervous to the point where im saying stupid stuff like corny jokes or awkward laughing or lately a need to be alone to get rid of the empty feeling in the back of my throat and dropped stomach...

Chronic liar won't shut up.... How to deal with her? ,"A girl that I know (and can never avoid because she is clingy) is constantly making lies about herself to maker herself seem ""cool"" and attempts to degrade everyone by showing off how supposedly smart she is. Everyone I know who knows her are aware of the lies that she puts up, but she seems to be unaware that everyone sees through her. 

An example: she says she received 2220 on the December 2011 SAT, but when she was calculating on my laptop her most recent SAT score (I just looked up sat.collegeboard.com to see my scores, I calculated mine, and she asked if she could go on hers to see her score) , I saw her scores and watched her add up to a 1450, painfully low compared to her brilliant ""2220"" score. 

Another example: She told everyone that her parents are getting her either a new BMW, or a new Lexus (when both of her parents are nail salon artists, and clearly will *not* get her a brand new car.) She doesn't even have her permit (she told me herself). 

I don't have high tolerance for her and her lies anymore, and I'm resisting calling her out (as much as I freaking want to.) How do you deal with people who are constantly clingy, lying, and condescending? I have her in one class, and the only friends she has are my friends (she knows I don't like her, so she doesn't talk to me as much. But when she does talk to me, she tries to flatter me to get to my good side which is purely restricted to her.) I'm being civil, and I'm only coldly civil to her when she tells her lies constantly, over and over again. 

**TL;DR** - I don't have high tolerance for a girl who never stops to keep making up lies about herself to make herself ""cool"" and outrageously smart. How can I deal with her? I can't seem to completely avoid her. How do I get her to stop, or resist being mean to her? "

how do I handle this news?,"let me start by making things clear - I've done wrong here. I won't shift the blame, I won't sugar coat it, and I won't start pretending its ok. I messed up. I've apologized and I apologize again.  I've had issues mentally (anxiety) for a while now, but this particular issue started nearly a week ago.  I was feeling particularly bad leading up to this, so I decided to visit a friend (person one) who is quite good to be around (to make this better, this person knows I've had a crush on them before but we were over that). through the day we hung out, talked, I taught them some self-defense and we had fun, and that was it. the week went on fine, and then 5 days later was my birthday party. myself, person one and a few others (including person two).  we had an attempt at a game, which dissolved into drunk comedy and fun, though I noticed at one point person two was a lot cuddlier that night. I didn't think much of it, however, as most people who were there are very physical like that platonically and I knew person two definitely didn't/doesn't have feelings for me, which is fine. the following dad, myself self and my dad were discussing the night and laughing about it when he said that apparently person two was being cuddly to distract me from person one. this didn't immediately say anything to me, but between then and me messaging them earlier tonight it started to grow on me. it soon reached me messaging them about my head, and I also mentioned that I heard about the planned hugging. to abbreviate what they said they were actually quite uncomfortable about what happened and didn't want to make things awkward between us by saying so, so I asked person two to make sure nothing stupid happened. again, what happened was clearly my fault and ill hold my hands up to it, but my problem lies with the fact I now have to think about what I trust. can I trust my friends to be honest with me, can I trust myself to not take things to far? can I trust that I'm not going to depend on people and that I'm not going to cause harm around me? how do I go about this?"

Do I have the right to be made at her for that kind of stuff even after i told her I didn’t like her using those things? 

TL;DR. Do I have a right to be mad at my best friend for drinking and using a pen after I told her I didn’t like it?"
My art teacher gives me constant anxiety and makes me feel panicked.

Now im not gonna get it back and it just threw me over the edge and i had a breakdown in the bathroom. I know the year’s almost over but could i use mental health issues to drop this class? Coming to art throws off my whole day and i just cant cope with it anymore."
I need help!,"Oh God. This will be a long one. It's crush problems. Yuck. I've never liked romantic movies or books, they always disgusted me. And kissing was way worse! It made me nauseous to think about any type of kissing or anything romantic. I know, I know, I should grow up. I'm just so bothered , though! I did have a crush, though. I was 10. We were friends at first and then got to know each other. He was caring and surprisingly mature for a 10 year old! Anyways, he kind of flirted with me. I still thought it was gross. I followed him around a lot and one day I asked if he promised to be my boyfriend and marry me. He said yes. It was cute, buy then we got older and just forgot about it. We didn't like each other anymore. It wasn't a dramatic breakup, we were 10! Now I'm 14. Never had a crush since, although we are still friends and hang out at lunch. As friends. I'm still kind of disgusted by relationships, although I'm waiting for when I won't be. One day I was texting someone because we had to work on a library project together. I had never met her in person, buy she seemed pretty cool. In my mind, we bonded immediately. We both had a lot in common: we both drew anime, both loved cooking, and hated relationships. We both thought we were too young for relationships, we were still children, after all! And I was disturbed whenever I thought about 4 years ago. Anywho, we planned the whole thing for the book fair and that was that. Never saw each other, never hung out or texting again, until the next week when we planned to meet up and discuss the book fair. When we got there, I was horrified. I saw her and I completely lost it! She was so perfect looking, and her smile was so kind. I'd never even seen her before, but I acted as if we had been friends for ages. I was completely obsessed with her, I practically stalked her. It scared me a lot. I could barely speak when I was around her. I had dreams about her when we were in romantic relationships. I know this all sounds like I have a huge crush on someone, but actually, it confuses me. I wasn't lesbian. At least, I didn't think so. Relationships disgust me, so I never even thought about my sexuality. It can't be a real crush. I still can't decide if I like her in that way! We only talked for about a day on text, and when we met up in person we barely looked each other in the eye. She doesn't really say ""hi"" to me when we're at school and she never texts me. Ever. We are hardly friends, we're just acquainted and have to work on a school project. I feel so pathetic. I want to see her so badly! I don't know what to do. Please help!

Re do,"Ok so i just posted it but i reread it and it was really confusing so I am going to retype it. 

Me ( F 19) and my friend M ( M 17) have been friends for about 9 years. I had a crush on him for a good amount of time and he recently got in a relationship with V , a mutually friend. At the beginning of their relationship i acted out of jealousy and i was very cold to her. After a little i realized my mistake and i talked to her about this. I never told her that i had feelings for him but i apologized for my rude behavior. I thought she accepted my apology but for about 2 months of trying to talk to her and hang out with her she would just ignore me so i gave up. During christmas i decided to throw a small get together and i decided to invite M but not V. Before i sent out invites i asked him if this was okay and he understood and said that it was okay. After about a week M and V were being kinda rude to me and i asked him what was up and he said she was really hurt that you didnt invite her. I was confused because she had actively ignored me for over 2 months. I apologized to her and invited her to my party. That same week our mutual friends N (F 18) and S (18) told me that she decided to throw her own party on the same day and invite all the people i invited to mine plus more. I just decided to cancel my get together to try to get away from the situation. After this situation i tried again to become friends with V and her friend K (f 18), K and me were really close but she has been pooling away lately. Everything i tried got denied and i was sick of it. I didnt tell M, N, or S this was happening because i didnt want to ruin their relationship with K and V. A month ago N and S came to me and told me that V and K were talking crap about all of us ( me, N and S ) I wasnt that hurt because i expected this but it really hurt N and S because they were closer to them. we tried to get over it and make things better between us but it didnt work. 
2 weeks ago we all went on a trip to disney with our band and of course we were all put together in a room. Me , V, K, S, N, and my new friend E (f 16). We all tried to include V and K into things we did but they ignored us. During the trip we really wanted to hang out with M but V is a super jealous girlfriend so we thought it was better to not talk to anyone in her group. M thought we were mad at him but i explained why after the trip. V and K told M that we were the ones ignoring them. This got me frustrated because they were ignoring us the whole time and they were whispering about us in our room. Me, S, and N are so frustrated with what is happening and we decided to talk to M. He was curious why all his friends were leaving him and we felt like it would be better to tell him what is happening. He suggest all of us (including V and K) talk together and my group agreed. M was talking to V about this and she got pissed at him and yelled at him for talking to us. 
Lately me N, and S have stepped away from the group just to get rid of all the drama. But to day things happened. S's birthday is coming up so she sent invites and since her and V and K are not in good standing she didnt invite them (also should be known that they didnt invite her to their party), but she did invite M. V found this out today and is no longer talking to anyone and she is putting M in a hard situation. It is like she wants him to pick his friends or her. Seeing all my friends so upset and sad really gets to me and i need fix this. I am moving far away in 3 months and i would really love to leave knowing that there is no bad blood. Please help if you can. Thank you 

also sorry for the long feed"
Should I quit softball?,"This season is coming up and starting in 3 weeks. I still don’t know if I’m playing and I’ve been thinking for the past 3 months and been unable to decide. I am in desperate need of some help

Summary of my situation:
I’m a sophomore this year and I was the only pitcher on my team last year. I was overworked and got an injury near the end of last season from repetitive motion in my shoulder. I went to PT all fall/winter and still can’t pitch or throw without pain. Anyway, last year I was miserable and was under so much pressure to constantly perform perfectly. The coach was also mean. I started to lose interest in softball, the sport I’ve been playing for 10 years. A lot of my friends are on the team too and I don’t want to let them down. I’ve talked to my coach and there most likely aren’t any other positions for me on the team, other than bench, since I can’t really pitch. 


I need to decide wether or not to play this season. I honestly can’t make a decision and nobody is really helping me. I am being persuaded to play by everyone I talk to (including my parents). My parents keep telling me to do it and sit on the sidelines all season and be a “team player.” I get how this is important, but it seems like such a waste of time to me if I’m going to be committing so much time to just observe.


Reasons I don’t want to play: 
- I’m worried about my shoulder and making it worse. 
- I hated it last year and didn’t have fun. 
- It was too stressful. 
- It took up all of my free time 6 days a week for 3 months. 
- I would have to quit my job that I’ve been working for 3 weeks at. 
- I wouldn’t be able to focus on my hobbies or school 
- I would be happier and better mentally. 


Reasons I want to play/things holding me back from quitting: 
- My friends are on the team and I might feel left out/ regret quitting 
- things might be better this year 
- I’ve been playing for such a long time and idk if I’m ready to let go. 
- I don’t want to piss my friends off and let down the team. 
- I would walk by my coach everyday and have a really awkward time in her gym class senior year. 
- I wouldn’t see a lot of my friends often. (I’m kind of introverted and don’t have many friends, so it would be hard for me to go out and make new ones)
- I would feel very bad for quitting and leaving the team to struggle. 


If anyone is still reading this and has anything to say, I would really really like to hear another perspective. Especially from someone who isn’t biased one way."
How do I take a step forward with a girl. I'm 15 she's 17,"We didn't talk at all. One day I go to get my backpack and we get a huge eye contact, she just stares at me. Next time in the disco we were in one place so we had a small chat. I said some kinda joke and she said she liked me. After the disco next days in school she didn't even say hi to me. Next time we get a huuuuge eye contact she stares at me for like good 4  seconds. On valentines day we were in a group of like 6 people and I asked who could help me deliver love mails to teachers, cause i didn't know some of them. She volunteered to help me. I don't know if these were good signs and how should I take a step forward. We have a couple of mutual friends. She doesn't even say hi to me in school."
My ass burns everytime I clean it,I don't know why but everytime I clean my ass it burns like hell. I have a suspicion that I didn't clean my bum properly and now there's an infection or something like that. In need of help.
How do you shave your bum?,I know it's weird but I noticed that cleaning my bum takes longer and longer so I decided to take a look at it and I found out that there is way too much hair on there.
How Can I Help?,My friend started dating this guy and then after a month he broke up with her. She really cared about him and now a couple months later it’s still hitting her hard. Is there anything I can do to help her or is this one of those things that take more time?
please help me,"my friend has completely disappeared. i have no means of contacting any of her friends/family. she lives in a different state. she has made a suicide attempt in the past, but she seemed very happy the past few weeks. it's been 2 days since i've last heard from her. yes, she could be busy, without internet connection/phone. but, she never has disappeared like this before. what do i do? she's one of my best friends."
How should I convince my parents to let me hang out with friends?,"Recently a girl my age moved a couple blocks away from my house and we became frinds. My mom wont let hang out with her and I am really anoyed. How should I convince her to let me hang out with friends. I am 13 btw and we live in a safe neighborhood.

I have been getting so much anxiety from this because i build up the courage to ask my mom and she says no and then i feel bad and have to tell her no and i have been so stressed becasue i feel like my mom should trust me. I dont do the kind of stuff the kids at my school do and I have all A+ or A- grades. Please help me"
18m uk,"Hello, I just turned 18 in October and since then have been wondering what the hell i am going to do with my life. I dropped out at 10 because of anxiety and depression and my parents tried fo put me into private tutoring  but i stopped going because i was too depressed.
 Since then it's been a blur and I'm just now realising playing games in my room and fucking around with my friends will get me nowhere. 
 But the thing is I live in the wales, uk and have no idea where the fuck to start. I enrolled in a act trade school and have zero Gsce's i just don't know what the fuck to do idk what the fuck to do i am not really interested in trade jobs"
Extra aggravating crush,"I am freshly 18, and ive never ever been interested in someone more than a year younger than me before, but now im interested in a 14 year old who i think is also interested in me.

I thought he was 16ish, not 14, when we started talking, he kept making sexual comments to only me, no one else in our group. Me and him have similar interests and sense of humor, he acts and looks like hes just a year or two younger than me, not 3 and a half... I feel like an awful person for feeling this way but i thought he was older when it developed and the crush has stuck.

Opinions on this and what to do :("
a guy i think i love,"i have been friends with this guy for a little bit of time and we have spent a lot of time together. whenever i am with him i am happy and i can tell a difference in my mood and whenever we are in the same place i just want to be around him. i feel like he’s the only one who knows how to make me feel happy and he makes me feel like there is actually a purpose for me being  in the world. I know i am in love with him but i don’t want to come out with it because he also dated one of my friends. i don’t know what to do because something has happened recently where he betrayed my trust but part of me still likes him/ loves him the same as i did before. I don’t know what to do and am lost because i have never felt this way towards another person before, he’s on my mind all day and he’s basically all i talk about. i really need advice because i don’t have anyone i can talk to and all my friends wouldn’t know what to do either. we have also flirted before but i feel like guys around me are using me for my body which has destroyed my self confidence level tremendously which is making me scared to tell him. i feel like i’m stuck and i need help/ advice on what to do."
My friend has anxiety and recently just told me that he’s suicidal,"A friend of mine admitted that he was feeling suicidal. I already knew he had anxiety. We’re in middle school (getting ready for HS) and I’m terrified he’ll start cutting himself or try to commit suicide. His parents already know about the situation, at least I think so, but they haven’t taken him to get therapy or to the doctors. I told him he can text me during school if he needs me to help him calm down. I have no idea how to calm someone who’s having an anxiety attack down, same goes for depression/suicidal thoughts.
Just the thought of him having an attack and me not being there to help him makes me sick to my stomach and I feel really guilty when I’m out of school sick.
How do I help him? I’m so scared every time I don’t see him at school that something happened, and that it was my fault for not being there often enough."
My mom won't let me post pictures of myself.,"I'm a 15 year old girl and my mom doesn't let me post pics of me on social media. When I do she tells me she is going to take my phone away from me. When I ask her she just tells me the classic ""Because I said so."". Anyone experienced something like this or knows why she does it?"
I need some sugge4, So there is a girl she's heart broken and I don't know how to help her cause anytime we get anywhere this guy shows up and ruins all of our progress and I really care about this girl so I want her to be happy again but I don't know how to help her. Anyone got any suggestions
Hoe do I respond to learning about someone's depression?,"There's been multiple instances where I have learned that a friend is depressed or something similar and and I honestly don't know how to react. I've noticed I'm not the only one too. I overheard someone telling their (and my) friend that she had cut herself. My friend just responded, ""oh... don't do that."" I was thinking, ""that was a really horrible response"", but at the same time, I don't know what I would've said that's better. Glad the girl at least had someone she could vent to though"
Sorry I know it’s an awkward question,"Hi, so I just wanted to ask, how do you hide a bulge? I’m really uncomfortable about it being seen and sometimes it’s really awkward because of how noticeable it is but how do other teens on here hide it? What’s the best way to hide it at school

I’ll answer any and every question,"
How To Have Success With Women,https://youtu.be/QaileTRj7oE
I’m unsure about an idea,"So, I am a sophomore in high school and really love history. I want to study history in college but have heard stories of history being a useless degree. So recently, I began thinking to study something else when I went. I don’t know anymore and I hate that. Can someone please give me advice?"
Getting another job,"Over the previous summer i worked at a Walmart and absolutely hated it, i was an awful employee, called in sick a bajillion times and just ghosted the company instead of quitting respectfully. I realize what i did was terrible and i think it's making it harder for me to find another job.

So i guess my questions are:

1. is it even worth it to put my time on Walmart onto a resume?
2. Will a prospective company find out if I exclude it?
3. and what types of jobs are available to someone with a bad track-record?"
Bashed by ex friend for something I didn’t do.,"Sorry if this is a bit long, I barely post on Reddit.

So today, at school, I was bashed by my 
problematic ex friend on the basis of the statement that I supposedly shit talked all my friends. Which I didn’t, besides one, the girl who bashed me, and it was more like criticism because she has been doing lots of bad stuff recently, and all the others had been talking about her too. But I didn’t talk about the others.

On Sunday I get a dm from my best friend, saying that I shit talked her according to problematic friend, not to deny it because she know what I had said, how I better be careful what I do next and how it really hurt. I thought back to see if I remember doing so, which I didn’t. Got a bit mad and explained I had not done so, which didn’t garner a response. 

I send the dm to my other best friend, who said she believes that problematic friend is trying to both kick her and I out of the friend group, and I agree. However she comes back with a dm from the previous friend explaining that I had also shit talked about her?? Which I also knew I hadn’t. Confused. I said that yet again, I didn’t, and I get left on seen, twice. So then I asked the problematic friend nicely at first whether she had said that I shit talked my friends to them. She denied, and instantly said “I don’t need your bullshit, fix this yourself” and stuff like that, even though first friend explicitly said that problematic girl says this.


I leave it be, and announce how I’m leaving the group as I had other friends that treated me better, and I didn’t need toxicity and how they didn’t listen to me. No response either. Whatever, I guess. Then today came, and problematic girl told my boyfriend that I was to be bashed. She sees me, and starts yelling obscurities, and I told her to piss off. She comes up to me, and I try to de-escalate by saying how I didn’t want to fight, and how I wouldn’t hit her, and we could talk about this normally, to no avail, she threw a punch to which I blocked. However I’m a really really weak fighter, so I lost, she threw me to the ground and I just shielded myself as she threw punches at me and kicked and pushes, left school after that with all the kids laughing and filming.


I know I’m not in the wrong. The situation they brought up where I supposedly talked shit was misunderstood by a metric fuck ton. 
I went to get books from my locker, friends ditched me, and I was too tired to look for them. So I found problematic girl and her friend, sat with them for a bit. I brought up how I was ditched, but I didn’t really care and how I thought they were mad at me or something, and they must of taken this as shit talking. But I know I didn’t, I have no reason to, and I loved these friends. 

My question now is, what the fuck do I do? I’m thinking of moving schools, because I have no other friends, my bf is possibly going to break up with me after this, and getting those friends back is not an option sadly.

TD:LR; accused of shit talking friends, did not do that, problematic friend bashes me for said situation."
Quiet rebellion,So I've been cutting my hair for the last three days and my mom hasn't noticed. I've been wanting short hair for awhile but my mom said no very disappointed. I don't really know what I'm doing. Should I find another way or continue until she notices. I've told my dad and he seems chill. I plan on asking a friend to even it out so it doesn't look bad while im cutting it during the night time. Does anyone know what I can do to prevent my mom from knowing sooner than wanted?
Clubs and Nightlife,"Hi, I'm Jane and I'm 19. I moved out of my parents house for college last year. Currently I am studying and living in quite a big city. 
So, I join my friends to go to bars and clubs lately. I was wondering is there any hack or safety tips I could use when something happen or for me to use for my safety. I usually went to clubs with my guy and girl friends that I really trust. Fortunately, so far nothing happen. All is fine. 
I usually went to a club where there is a lot of foreign people and students.
Can you guys please share your tips or experiences during your nightlife? I would like to know and probably learn something new from you guys! ;D
Thanks

I have a crush on my friend and I'm jealous of his new crush," I've been low key sad (*very* sad) for the past few days, and I couldn't figure it out. I think it finally hit me today why...

This started a few weeks ago.

My friend and I were messing around during lunch and somehow it ended up with him hardcore flirting with me as a joke. At first, obviously I knew it was a joke and didn't take it seriously. But as it went on for a couple of weeks, I kinda started having some feelings. But, he has a different lunch now, and he told me two days ago that he was hardcore flirting with someone else, and she actually flirted back (I didn't; I'm too awkward to flirt back). I thought nothing of it until, today. My other friend told me that this girl told her that she was dating him. I thought nothing of it again. But, as the day went on, I slowly kept feeling worse, until I talked to him. He said that she reminded him of his ex and was falling for her. I thought that I didn't care, but when I got home, I felt really down and I had no idea why. I'm usually not like that at all. I had some time to think over things, I realized that I was feeling so low and sad for the last two days *after* he told me about this other girl.

I don't know. We're friends, but I have no idea how these feelings developed. And because he's falling for someone else, I feel worse. How do I deal with this? Should I just keep my feelings repressed? I don't know..."
The MOST important mindset to be in if you’re single and new to dating,Here are some levels to stay in abundance https://youtu.be/QwzWU6i-Zl0
My ex's best friend,"(17/F) Soo I'm friends with a group of guys, we're classmates. I talk to them almost every evening on discord, and we play together. About a year ago I had a crush on one of them, but nothing happened (although he was probably into me, too). After I'd moved on (or at least I tought I had) I dated his best friend for 4 days, but then I realized I didn't have any feelings for him, so I broke up with him. Since, he's said that he was over me, and we're still good friends. Now everything is the same between us. We're a month later in the present and I've fallen in love with the first guy again. I had no idea what to do. One evening he was left alone with me on discord. We were talking about our lovelives and how we were both really unlucky. I said if neather of us would succeed, let's go on a date. He said not that he wouldn't want to, but he wouldn't date his best friend's ex. Do you think his opinion could change? Or that with this hint I planted a thought in his head, that could bloom into something in the future?"
Long story but 15 and need advice?,"Pretty much theres one guy who at least to me seems amazing. He is really funny, nice, has the same music taste as me, makes amazing music, plays instruments (including saxophone like ahh i love sax so much its so preeetty), apparently has a really great family, has some of the same friends as me, is v cute oops, gave me butterflies for the first time (i thought that was a made up thing wtf), and more. So after posting on my spam account that I didnt want to like him anymore because im too awkward, one of mine and his friends said that i should do something because he wont be in my school next year. SO  I did probably the most brave thing ive ever done (im not brave if you couldnt tell ahha) and went up to him in person in front of all of his friends and spoke to him i was so nervous lmao; the full palms sweaty moms spaghetti. I then spoke to him after and he was so nice to me and ah. Its just that we havent spoken since and its too awkward to talk in person (he literally said to me ""sorry if it was awkward"" so, well...). So if you couldnt tell by now im 1.a naturally nervous person 2.someone whos never been in a relationship or anything like that. I dont know what to do now. We dont sit next to each other in class, and ive been told i give off a very shy vibe but then when you get to know me im surprisingly talkative (just dunno how to get to the point where he knows that because he makes me 10x more nervous than I already would be). Its weird because I always think to myself that nothing could ever happen between us but then there will be times where ill see him looking at me and that one time he spoke to me he was giving me loads of compliments (things that friends do too so i should stfu ahah) but like honestly id be just as happy just being his friend he seems like a great friend. Do you have any advice on how to actually talk to him properly in person and not just every once in a while over dms?"
Want to be alone at school,"Hi, I'm 18 and currently in my last year in school. I have A-levels at the end of the school year which are basically major exams. I'm quite sociable in school, I can pretty much talk to anyone about anything however, lately I've been feeling a bit drained when I've been having conversations with people. I always feel like I'm the one that's initiating conversations and I really can't be bothers to do that anymore. I just feel like being alone at school for a while to kind of ""recharge"". Just have minimal contact with other people at school and just focus on myself. Is that normal?"
Without purpose,"Hi there! I'm 18F. In 5 month I have my high school graduation with a big exam. I don't have dreams or something to live for, only my sister who is pregnant (Yay). I got these stupid disease, Lupus for life and I think that this made me give up living. It's not that dangerous for me, but I wasn't looking up to future before being diagnosed. I got no friends, I like being lonely, I have a boyfriend who could be happy without me. Don't think I'm gonna kill myself, I'm a chicken, I just need an advice to get out from this sad circle. Thank you!"
Fustrated about College and Mom,"So I recently found a college that I want to go to. It’s a semi big university, 21,000 students. I told my mom about it then we decided I might potential go there. Now that I got my fafsa I realize that I don’t have enough money to go and neither does my mom and I don’t want loans. So I apply for a community college and I told my mom that I wanted to go there first both because we don’t have the money and it’ll give me a steady start to college. She continues to try and push the idea of going to the big university on me and gets upset because she really wants me to experience the big university life. I really dislike having to argue about my future with her when she’s not gonna be stuck with the bill later on. What should I do?"
People accusing me of lying about sexual asssult,"About 2 years ago, at my college a boy a year older than me pressured me into having sex with him.

 I went to his house for the first time, and I sucked his dick, and that was fine, then I went there a second time, and I sucked him off again the night before and he tried to fuck me but it wasn't working so we stopped, then in the morning I had a drink so I was slightly tipsy, and he was like, I wanna try and fuck you again, and I was like, ""I don't really want to, I mean, if you really want to but I don't really want to"" and he was like ""Okay, turn over and get on your hands and knees"" and the whole time getting into the position I was literally begging in my mind for my mom to come and pick me up. And he didn't actually get it in my vagina, but he fucked my thighs until he came I think, or he stopped cause it wasn't working. I've pushed it out of my memory. And I went home like almost right after. And the whole way home I was wondering if I should tell my mom. Then like a few weeks later I'm like, I don't wanna date you, I don't like you like that, and then he started being an ass hole. I was worried he was gonna tell everyone, so I told my friend (Let's call them Alex) what happened because I didn't know what to call it, she said it was rape. So I told one of my ""friends"" about it because I didn't know what to do because the more I thought about it and the more I saw him the more I wanted to fucking die. Someone overheard me saying it to Alex, and started spreading that I was going around telling everyone I was raped by the guy, then I looked into it more and was like. I guess it was just assault. So I said to everyone, ""no he pressured me into it, I think it was sexual assault"" but I didn't wanna press charges and go through all that because it would of gone no where. And now, 2 years later , this one girl, is still fucking talking about it. Saying ""I don't like them because they lied about rape and someone heard them confessing they lied about it over the technician's headset."" 

I don't want to be confrontational to the girl who's saying this about me, but I don't know what to do. I have 4 months left, and I know I should push through but 4 months feels like forever.

I starting to wonder what I should call this as well. Am I wrong? Did I over react?"
Hi im a teen girl and i want to be infibulated,"Hi i want to be circumcised to be pure how do i ask my parents or where can i get it done
im 14 btw"
Am I selfish? What can I do to make things better? (Long post) (Trigger warning?),"About a year ago my parents got into a nasty divorce (I’m talking about the whole fighting over custody of my little sister, making eachother bankrupt, and dating ex’s type of stuff) so in order to get some income for me(19F),my mom, and sibling I got a job. As time went on I wasn’t doing well in my classes and stoped showing up to Lectures. My job got terrible and the boss gave no shits about how the work environment was. About 6 months after the divorce my parents made up and got back together. I wanted to be happy about it but It was still tough for me. I felt like I had no where to go and I felt I needed to work to be useful, my classes were going awful cause I never showed up, and I lost interest in all my hobbies. (I had planned a couple a days during this time when I was going to overdose but I couldn’t bring myself to do it) Eventually my parents noticed my health state and decided it was time for me to leave my job. 3 weeks after quitting I have got back into my Art (this is my career choice my major is Graphic Design) and started joining art shows. My parents support my art but they are now saying they didn’t want me to quit my job because I do nothing around the house and sleep all day. Since quitting my job I have done more in the few weeks for my career than I have done in the whole year, I have been going to my classes again, and when I can I clean the house and make food for the family (It May not be spotless cleaning but it is enough to make the house look nice) I tried telling my mom and she felt betrayed that I didn’t tell her I was having problems with school and stuff before I quit my job and she is mad at me for not saying anything. I don’t know if I should tell my mom how messed up my mental state is right now and how it has been because she will feel betrayed but I don’t want to disappoint them either. Are there any tips on how I can motivate myself to do more and be more useful rahter than doing the stuff that just helps me? Should I go back to work to be useful again"
My Mom Hates all of my girlfriends.,"Hello. I don't really know how to start this but I guess I'll just do a quick rundown of who I am. My name is Noah and I'm a 16 year old honor roll student. I enjoy school, art, and like every other human romance. Recently I've been dating more often and I've been having issues with my mom. I understand why she didn't like my last ex. The last girl I dated was extremely rude and was different in text. However now I'm dating a new girl. We've been really close friends since last year, and I had my first kiss with her. She means a lot to me and I really love her. Although my mom dislikes her. The craziest part is that she has never met her. Not once. Yet she will consistently say things that hurt my feelings. Ex: ""She's ugly"", ""she makes you have an attitude""... 

Non of this is true. At least in my opinion. I always want to improve for my girlfriend and she is a major reason for me being happy right now. Sure we have our ups and downs but I never let that get into my life after school. Yet my mother persists hauling these insults my way. 

If anyone has had a similar situation please help. I really hate my mom's disapproval for no valid reason. Even if you just heard me out I appreciate it. It feels really frustrating at some points. Thank you a million times."
How should I tell my crush I like him on Valentine’s Day ?,"I (13f) am making him (14 m) cookies and I’m not sure if I should just tape them to his locker or give them to him in person, and if I should tape them to his locker, should I include a note saying I like you, etc. /what should it say?

Compulsive(?) thoughts about nonexistent thoughts and feelings about crush that need to fuck off,"Background- teenager in British school in class
Basically I get these annoying thoughts and feelings when I walk by someone I used to have a crush on who didn't like me back. If I have her clearly in my sight or closer peripheral then when walking past her I might walk faster becuase it's uncomfortable but I'll think to myself how this is becuase ""I really wish she liked me"" and its like an outsider perspective really, but it's instantaneous and I can't really stop the thoughts becuase it's just in the moment and completely throws away my sense of honest character and becuase I think I'm concerned about how they might judge my actions (walkingfaster) and what I think it looks like even if they don't care/notice which is where they arise from (the thoughts)

Dead social life, poor social skills, not great friendships so it just sucks man,
Anyway appreciate if you do have any advice apart from meditation, awareness of the moment and reaction in it, and prioritising other things to focus on in moment like friends or things I'm going to do/in middle of doing. Also apologies for phone formatting btw
Anyway great appreciation if you do try and help, really nice and sound."

How can I earn some money for myself,"So I (13F) am going on a class trip to Costa Rica this year. Next year my school has a trip to Greece, which is my dream vacation destination. I would love to go but 2 international trips back to back is not something my family can afford. My mother said I can go, but only if I can earn some of the money for myself. I am a straight A student and would potentially be interested in tutoring but not sure how to get started or even if I could make much money from tutoring. Are there any other ways I could earn money to go on the trip? I can play play piano and a little flute but I don’t have either of these instruments anymore. I did dance for many years but I don’t think I’m good enough to teach. Aside from my smarts I don’t really have any talents so I’m not exactly sure how I could earn money. I have been selling crochet and macrame work that I do but it’s not making enough money for me to put a lot of time into it."
Where do I go from here?,"It’s my second semester of grade nine, and since it’s my first year of high school I’ve been trying to settle in but a lots been happening. I’m a pretty below average kid, I have good literature skills and an ok natural voice, maybe some other minor intellectual skill as well but either than that I have nothing. I have ADD so studying and keeping consistent grades is a really difficult task, I’m not a sporty person either. I’m introverted which already whines off the idea of joining the band or drama club. Worst of all, however, is my friend situation. I got into some drama with one group I hung out with surrounding my crush so I’m kinda isolated from them, and my group of popular friends feel too awkward to be around, after seeing them smoke weed and stuff while I just was there with them. In summary, what I’m saying is I have no friends to hang out with and no skills to really count on. Does anybody have advice on what I can do to cope with the loneliness or maybe improve my situation?"
I don't know what to believe,"There are people at my middle school who say their depressed, it's confusing. There so open about their ""depression"" but wouldn't someone depressed not want to talk about it? She tells me how she was depressed when she came overseas and when she was finally out of that state people actually thought she was depressed and harassed her back into depression again. I don't know, it seems far fetched, and then she says that she has voices in her head. I've heard from someone else she claimed to be molested in the U.S before coming overseas. But then how has no one found out about this? She never reported it? I can see it but then she says she doesn't trust therapists because one elegantly told her she was being overdramatic. I agree with the therapist on that one. And then she almost got me in trouble with another friend, she lied and said that I talked shit behind other friends back. So it may be that she just lies for attention/pity. And then she says she's bisexual at age 13, how do you know? You've never held hands with a girl let alone dated one. But I don't know, it all seems far fetched for some middle school girl to have all this shit. And its not just her, its like every girl says their depressed, bisexual, and have  a mental issue. And other than these claims and how annoying it gets to hear about the shit that's wrong with you and how you don't trust anyone but half the Fucking school to tell your depressed too, a lot are actually really nice people! I don't know, I need a 3rd opinion wise redditors."

Strategies to get laid and the number one trait to attract more women,Here are some tips https://youtu.be/4FBpi-sxnPA
"I feel hopeless, what should I do to help?","Recently I (F18) have been struggling to pay a medical bill from my car accident. Reapplied for health insurance because I was dropped and got denied because my parents make too much. It's so frustrating when trying to talk to them because it's either ""everything will work out"" or ""don't worry about it because it doesn't affect you"", when in actuality it affects me so much more then they know. It feels like I am talking to a brick wall.  I'm just lost on how to feel or what to do. I've been saving up to help with expenses but it is SO hard when I have no job or ways to get places."
Difficult Sports Decision,"I'm a sophomore in high school and I've been struggling with a tough decision for a few months now.

I haven't played school sports until this year, and I picked up running cross country and track and field. Since I started in late August, I have progressed from pretty awful, to the point where I am competing at varsity meets. I show lots of future potential (I seriously have improved a lot, which I am happy with). The high school I go to is top 3 for running in the entire state, which is already a competitive one, and I just made varsity. At this particular school, those who run are *somewhat* obligated to run all three seasons, meaning cross country and both track seasons. My coach is quite pleased with how I've improved, and my parents are off the walls about running this and running that since I have gotten pretty good, and no one ever really thought of me as that great of an athlete. So, physically speaking, my life is dedicated at the moment to continue improving as a runner. 

&#x200B;

Additionally, I have high hopes for the future which aren't running related, and involve me showing that I can be a good athlete. Hence, I need one or more varsity letters to apply to specific colleges. 

&#x200B;

So the thing is, over the course of this year I have gotten to the point where I just about hate running. I've lost 10 pounds while trying to maintain my weight (I didn't really have any weight to lose and I wasn't half-assing my effort to stay the same size, either), I have gotten weaker, and I feel like a pussy for it. It sounds stupid, but for the longest time I have absolutely loved lifting weights and training my physique. At this point, I know for a fact that I could continue where I am going, but I will genuinely hate the way I am; a sacrifice to be an elite-level runner. I have decided personally that it's just not worth it, and I want to finish this outdoor track season, but I don't want to run cross country. And after that: I would like to do wrestling in the winter. 

&#x200B;

My school has a great wrestling program, and I have always wanted to try wrestling, but I haven't done it before. The coach is notorious for being a tough guy with tougher workouts, and that's what I would want to do more than anything: a combative sport where I can get stronger, instead of a sport that I am good at but hate doing. I have spoken to people on the team and they all said, for what word of mouth is worth, that I would make the team since I'm a pretty small guy (118 lbs and 5'6) but am strong and lean.

&#x200B;

I have no idea how to really tell my parents that running isn't something that I am invested in anymore, and on top of that, I want to start something brand new. I think I want to wait until after the track season to tell them (so in mid-may). 

&#x200B;

Any advice on, if you can tell, I made the right decision: Do what I want to do, not what I am good at but dislike? And any advice on how to break it to my parents who won't shut up about my future in running? P.S. they are pretty supportive of any decisions, but I have never dropped a bomb like this before."
He's fucking with my head and it sucks. Pls help,"F(17yo)
So...context. This starts with a crush on an exchange guy, he also liked me at the start of the school year but I wasn't aware of it. 
I don't know how to process feelings, I just don't realize I like someone until it's too late, so ofc even though I smiled every time I saw him and all  that cheesy shit I just wasn't aware.
Enter other guy, this one was making his move, he was shooting his shot with me and wasn't afraid to be obvious so I went with it cause, ""yeah, why not? it's easy ik he likes me and I'm sort of attracted to him, yh sure let's do it. "" BAD IDEA ( turns out he's an asshole I ended it quick). This made the 1stguy who I actually wanted, give up on me and start talking to some girl, a week or so later they're dating... yay. 

Fast foward 2months later, 1st guy and me are at a party, his girlfriend isn't there we're a little tipsy and he pulls me away from the rest and tells me he had a big crush on me at the start of the school year. WHY WOULD U TELL ME THAT?!?! WHAT'S THE POINT?!? THAT'S JUST SELFISH. But anyway, that night we talked about the whole thing until we fell asleep... in each others arms, we basically cuddled and then something happened but, we didn't kiss or make out we just kind of touched eachother, he was incredibly cute about it he was asking me if I was okay or comfortable etc. After that we didn't even mention it, well just casually said  we remembered everything between 3am and 7am which is when all that happened. 

A month or so later there's another party, and again we cuddled and we danced and he pulled me in by the waist etc. Next day all he does is talk about his ""ex-girlfriend"" (they broke up but they still talk and they're pretty much still together) TO ME AND IN FRONT OF ME.

When she's there he completely ignores me, but ofc at a party without anyone that knows her it's all good WTF. IM SO CONFUSED AND I HATE SEEING THEM TOGETHER. 

My questions, 
Am I being played?
Should I completely stop talking to him?
What tf is going on?
We haven't talked about any of this and I'm so mad at him, I want to give him a piece of my mind  but I can't."

"So i have a Guilty conscious, Advice?","
This is a bit long, TLDR near the bottom


Ok so a few years ago me and my internet best friend (i only have internet friends) were talking and he had expressed that he liked me, i kinda picked up on some vibes here and there but i chalked it up to me being overly confident (not confident) or me being narcissistic (kinda am) so i wasnt sure, anyway he confesses and out of the heat of the moment i get caught up and convince myself that i liked him too....I DONT! We flirted fo a solid HOUR then he says hes going to sleep, cool thats how we usually end our conversations cause we talk for a while, anyway a few hours have passed, and the absolute wooorst heaviness in my chest, and guilt set in, because i was finally like ""oh fuck"" cause i didnt want to hurt him but i wanted to rip the band aid off so i wouldn't lead him on, sooo i kinda end up texting him a fucking essay basically saying im sorry for getting caught up in the moment and i hope we can still be friends yada yada yada, And. Then. I. Block.him., like Wtf how shitty is that?!?! Ughh anyways i un block him, he also blocked me, i was depressed for months, i contacted him through other means, and we start talking again and it was like we never stopped talking. 

ANYWAY we are super cool he has a girlfriend cassy (such a sweetheart) and i have tried dating but i still feel too guilty and i worry that ill do that to someone else unintentionally and hurt them!!!

:TLDR: I want to get back into dating but i feel guilty and i dont know how to stop feeling so guilty, like i can feel guilty for not getting through the level in panda pop because the pandas were in the buble too long, and it takes at least a hour to stop feeling bad so i dont know how to stop feeling guilty about this


Also im sorry i rant so much

Oh and me and him call this the ""incident"" or ""what happened"" and joke about it"
It is possible to get over this type of rejection?,"So what happened, i like one girl but she was trying to hook me with her cousin because she had feelings for me. One day she told me over text during casual conversation that she liked someone. But I don’t why my stupid ass next day texted her that i want to meet her so we decided to meet after her work,

But when i told her that i have feeling for you. she was like i told you that i like someone else and you are still asking me. And she was like i am sorry.

while leaving she said you are joking, right. I don’t know why i was like it was a prank and i had an bet with my friends that i had to ask one of my close friends?

But now i am feeling like first, i got rejected and second i even made a joke of myself by saying it was a prank now i am feeling like stupidest person in the world and pretty sure she is thinking the dame too cuz she is not even replying to my texts.

I don’t know what to fo anymore ☹️."

How to make a girl fall in love with you.,Here are some tips https://youtu.be/_go4uBNx2b4
I need help please,"So I’m 16 and I met this girl through my friend. We haven’t met before, she lives 6 hours from me. We started talking and FaceTiming every night and basically falling in love. I just assumed she was 16 also but today I found out she’s 14. I don’t know what to do because it’s just awkward because we were planning to meet up some time but now it just seems weird."
A lot has been going on and I’m stuck.,"I never thought I would ever be in this position, but I am so here we go:

Some context — I’m a middle class person of color (15M) who lives in the United States. I go to a super preppy, expensive as hell, private school (got in on a partial scholarship). You can probably expect that there’s not that much diversity, which is where my first problem arises. I’ve heard a lot of people talk about this before where they ‘find their people’ but there is not a single other person in my grade who looks or talks like me. I don’t feel in place at all.
 On top of that, school has been really stressful recently. I haven’t been doing poorly, but it’s super stressful. It seems like these things are temporary problems but I feel like the reality is that it continues throughout high school if I don’t address it, and maybe it might chase me for the rest of my life. 

Oh, and on top of all that, I have some serious problems at home on both sides of my family. My sister is super spoiled (goes to the same school, but has been there for longer) and she has lost all respect for our parents who sent her there. She’s just plain nasty to them and it hurts me. Also, my uncle on my mom’s side is struggling with obesity and had a heart issue recently (he’s in the hospital rn), and my uncle on my dad’s side is an extreme alcoholic who’s had liver failure and probably gonna die before his parents.

Meanwhile i’m stuck in between all this. If you were amazing enough to read all of this, I could really use some help. Everything is appreciated. <3"
I’m having doubts about my relationship of 2 years.,"I (f16) have been with my boyfriend (m18) for two years. He was the first boy I ever kissed and seriously liked. We started dating like a week after we first kissed and we’ve been together since and that was 2 years ago. I used to be so excited to see texts from him and to meet up with him but it feels like all that magic has been fading recently. We used to never run out of things to talk about but lately I feel like I’ve been having much less fun around him and I feel like I don’t have anything interesting to say. It just doesn’t feel right anymore. However, he is such a nice guy and I don’t want to lose him. He has no idea I feel this way and is constantly telling me how perfect for him I am and how much he loves me but it just doesn’t feel true when I say I love you back. He is so good to me and I’m so so lucky to have him but I feel like it’s not fair to stay with him when I’m not invested in this relationship anymore. It scares me how he’s so committed too. He’s openly told me that he can see a real future with me and that without me his life would be meaningless and he would have no one. I told him at the time this was crazy and he is valued by so many people, but I know that breaking up with him would shatter him. Like really break him. He’s not super close to many other people but we’re sort of in the same friend group so it’ll be awkward for us to break up. To be honest i feel stuck. If I don’t break up with him then I won’t be happy and I’ll just think about this all the time, but if I do then he will take it really badly and I’m so afraid of being lonely. I’ve known him for about 3 years altogether and I feel as though I’m too used to having him/I’m reliant on him. I’m terrified of being lonely and regretting it if I break up with him. Being with him is all I’ve known for so long and I think losing him would feel like such a hole in my life. I value having him around and he’s so supportive when I’m down. I would love to go back to being best friends like before we got together but that’s probably impossible now. I really don’t know what to do.. please help"
People accused me of stealing stuff,Okay well I've graduated high school for a couple of months now and this has kinda bothered me for a while. When I was in high school my friend's phone got stolen and I was accused of stealing it.well obviously I've stopped associating with them but I'm still kinda pissed. I don't know whether I should get revenge or confront them or just let shit go. I'm gonna go to college in a month or two btw.
Homie broke the bro code,"One of my good homies is trying to take the girl i want before i can get to her even though he has a girl.

We met her around the same time and he introduced her to me he told me it qould be good if we started talking maybe something could start between us. About five days ago him and her were chilling with her and her friend things were going good for me until he found out she smoked weed and wasn't as innocent as she was leading people on to belive. He started to get super flirty towards her which pissed me off

He the type of guy that puts hoes before bros and loves the attention girls give him. Whenever he arounda a girl or a group of girls he always switches up making himself seem more grand than he actually is which bothers me.

When they left i tapped him and asked him what he thought he was doing and he just told me ""maybe if you get better game and stop complaining so much girl will stop playing you"" which obviously pissed me off even more

The next day we were chilling at my house and i noticed they were snaping all day.

He broke the bro code and i dont know if i should try and take the girl by force or if shoukd just allow it and move on.

Any advice would be appreciated thank you"
I need of help/advice to save a friendship,"Alright I posted this on my last one, about me and my best friend’s(perhaps ex) relationship. What should I do, when should I tell them that I love them. I gave them space but I said something that I shouldn’t have on Thursday. Should I keep giving them space or tell them immediately?"
My parents are threatening me with my university application,"I (17F) recently got accepted to my dream program. My parents were originally happy for me, but they’re now threatening me with it.
I have chronic depression. While I’m high-functioning, it can be really difficult for me to find motivation. My parents know this. I’m medicated.
I do not have a job. I have sent out numerous applications, even gone out once or twice with a bunch of copies of my resumes, handing them out to every retail store available. When I did this, the stores either told me that they only hire online, or they’re not hiring at the second and will give it to the manager/keep the resume on file.
My parents don’t believe I’ve even applied. That, or they think I’m too lazy to reapply at every given time.
Anyway.
They’ve recently started telling me they’re going to call the university if I don’t get hired by a certain time. I have savings to fall back on, and OSAP (I’m Canadian), and yet they’re insistent that I don’t have anything, no ambition, and don’t deserve university. They’re genuinely going to call the freaking university and reject the offer of my dream school!
I don’t know what to do. Are they even allowed to do that? As a minor, can I stop them?
TL;DR My parents are threatening to call the university and reject my dream program’s offer if I don’t get hired. Can they do that?"
Sexting,"So I'm actually really sad that my guy best friend... Who I talked to after a year almost asked for sexting and sent kinky stuff. Told him I was gonna sleep n das it. But I'm just feeling sad n sad thinking of that. Another guy I talked to.. Bestie again.. All of a sudden is just ghosting me like I dun wanna even ask him why coz he'll reply with a lool n the end.

My girl squad doesn't care much.."
My almost 2 years relationship ended,"I can't accept the fact that its ended. Its like, she is still there. I don't have friends, I dont have anyone but her, so i don't know what to do. I was prepared for this. So I have no intentions of runing after her. But I miss her, I miss how we were. She just sid ''I don't have feelings for you anymore.''.

I always felt unworthy, and unloveable. But now, I dont even know if I have a life worth to live... Is it toxic, am i being obsessed...??"
I don’t know if I should change schools or not,"I’m having trouble making a decision on whether or not I should stay or leave my current school. Im in year 10 this year, living in Australia and i’m currently going to an all boys school. I have good friends there and I enjoy it well enough but i’m worried that it might not be the best for me for my final two years of school for these reasons
1 - Subjects
I’ve been told by some older friends that the subject selection isn’t great and that if you pick one subject you can’t pick the other which screws everything up and also the teachers and curriculum is average at best unless you get lucky with a great teacher and at the school i want to go to it looks like the subjects are a lot better.
2 - Religious School
The school I am currently at is catholic and I am not completely apposed to going to one it takes up a lot of time when we have mass and Religious Education is a compulsory subject through all years and it is a really dull subject with really bad and boring teachers. Also annoying little touch, where I live gets really cold during winter and all we are allowed to where are these crappy thin pants with no ability to keep anything warm and the uniform is overall bad.
3 - Social Skills
This is a big problem for me right now but I’m really bad socially. I have friends  and I know how to talk and make friends but i haven’t been to a co-ed school for over 6 years and I never really talked to girls then anyway. I feel like if I stay at this school I am going to not know how to talk to girls properly and not have good social skills in general. I don’t have any social media besides reddit and don’t like to use it anyway and I don’t know any ways I can meet girls otherwise.

My parents don’t care what school I go to they just want me to be happy and aren’t really religious. I really like the look of this knew school and if I can manage to get in I think I might go bit any advice would be much appreciated. My parents left it completely up to me"
I think I broke my TV,For some context my family recently moved to Canada (5 months or so) and were currently living in the basement of some family friends and paying rent. The place is alright but a bit small. We only have one TV and I think I broke it. I was playing fifa and I think my brother accidentally touched the plug or something and it turned off during and important game. I threw my controller on my TV stand thing which I usually can egt away with cuz the controllers quite durable. But I was not prepared for it to bounce off the table and hit the TV. The screen is cracked and currently my family don't know. They're like 10 feet away from me rn. What do I do? Does anyone know how much it costs to fix a TV and how long it takes?
2 years of this is too long...help,"Alright so here’s the thing. I’m a (F) in highschool and my best friend is also a (F) in highschool. We’ve been close for a few years but in 8th grade, I started to question my true feelings for her. I thought nothing of it really at first but when we went roller skating with our friends, that’s when I realized she may mean something more to me. We did the couples skate because that was the last skate of the night and we didn’t want to stop skating. We had to hold hands the whole time because that was the rule to do the final skate. I felt really nervous for “some reason” but again, didn’t think much of it. In 9th grade, things got interesting. She shared some really personal stuff with me, one thing being that she was confused about her sexuality and everything. She even said that she thought she liked one of our friends (F). That night, I did something bravely stupid. I almost kissed her. I got closer and closer but I ended up not going through with it cause I didn’t want to ruin our friendship or anything. At this point, she thought I was straight which confused her even more. After that night, she texted me as soon as I left saying that she missed me and everything, we also shared overnight phone calls moving on after that. Long story short, things were revealed and she implied that she might feel the same way that I thought I felt about her. This little flirtatious and leading on stage went on for a few weeks. All changed after she “talked to a school counselor” and revealed that they said she was just confused. She told me this of course after I fully confessed how I really felt which took a lot. She sent me really long paragraphs basically praising me and saying that she needs me in her life basically. After that, she started acting a little differently towards me and I noticed right away. She wasn’t as touchy and she just treated me very differently overall. It made me really sad. We had a sleepover with our other friend and we had a 4am “confession” time and she revealed that she doesn’t wanna be gay but she doesn’t know her sexuality. She also revealed that she thinks or thought she liked this one guy in her class. After our friend fell asleep, I started blabbering and talked about that night and basically revealed that that night was messing me up and I’ve been feeling a certain way ever since. She acted like she was asleep for a while but after I put a blanket over her, she said very sleepily, “you should’ve just done it” of course I was shocked and like so confused. That all messed me up even more. She started acting so distant after that confession night and she ended up taking a break from me and our other friend all summer. The WHOLE summer. No contact with us at all. It was later revealed when she came back into my life that it was partly because of me and everything that happened. A guy friend of ours that just recently came into our lives (whom she had feeling for apparently) helped us kinda get closure from that whole situation but I’m still left sad. Ever since she’s been back, she’s been acting more like how it used to be. Overnight calls every night, she wants to hang out all the time, engages with me, all touchy and stuff. I feel like there’s no way she doesn’t at least feel the same even a little bit. Not with everything we’ve been through and everything we continue to go through. I’m still confused on my feelings for her constantly but I know that I love her. I don’t know if it’s in a different way than a best friend but it’s a strong feeling. I get jealous and upset and sometimes mad at her for no reason which I feel really bad about...what do I do and what does this all mean??"
Am I weirdo for constantly looking at my crush,Hey I have a class with my crush. He’s so hot in my eyes so it’s really hard not to look. Every day I glance at him like every other  min in the class. He recently got a gf so oof. But i just want to know if a girl you don’t talk to glances at you all the time when you clearly notice is it considered weird or creepy. If so I’ll force myself to stop. It’s just that sometimes hell glance at me or we’ll make eye contact
My crush is touching me even though he has a girlfriend,"Okay so the boy I like has a girlfriend. His girlfriend is in another school, so they only see each other in their free time. The thing is, when I’m at school, he touches and leans against me A LOT. I don’t know if these are signs, or what those are. Some things that he does are:

When we are sitting on the ground or next to each other, he tends to lean his thigh agains mine so they touch. He often puts his hand behind me, so he is closer to me. I move away from him and he follows.

When I walk by him, he sometimes rubs his hand against my thigh. He does it discreetly, but I see it. Also he sometimes just grabs or *gently* slaps my thigh.

We don’t really talk too much anymore, but he has asked me and said that we are friends with benefits to me, and quickly brushes it off my saying “I’m kidding”. Once he asked if I was a virgin (yes) and if I wanted to wait until I was 16 (also yes) and he said to me “I’ll wait for you”. 

It’s not like I get uncomfortable from these things, I mean he is my crush. I just don’t understand if he is doing it on purpose, or if he is doing it without realizing. I want him and his girlfriend to break up, but I also don’t want to break them up, if that makes sense. I just need advice; is there a possibility that he is doing that on purpose? Does he like me, or is he just mocking me? If he likes me, should I go for him?"
How to talk to a shy guy? (F),"How to talk to a shy guys? (F)

In recent months, I came across a old friend on social media I haven’t seen in years. Over this time I developed a attraction for him, sparking a conversation with him I later realised he’s pretty shy. Most of are conversations are on text due to the distance, I really like him and don’t want to mess it up by scaring him. 


Please help? Any shy guys?"
There is this guy and idk what to do.,"He is so cute, and he really likes me, and I thought I liked him too but now I’m not so sure. At first I friend zoned him before he got the chance to tell me how he felt ( because I knew already and I wanted him to stop wasting time with me) then we went to a youth conference and we might have held hands ( he was trying so hard, how could I not ?!) and later I friend zoned him again. Then a few months later at a dance we hugged and I thought I felt a connection and he texted me later and said he still had feelings for me and I said I might have some too. He said I could take my time figuring it out ( how cute is that ) and then we went on some dates, held hands a few more times but then I told him I wasn’t ready for a relationship and we needed to stop. It’s almost been a year since I found out he liked me and he still isn’t over me and I’m so confused as to how I feel. Can anyone help?"
I think my friend is being abused,"Okay I’ll try to not reveal too much info.  So I have a good friend, she comes from a a strict religious family. Her parents are not her real parents keep in mind.  

The children there have a  certain age and requirement to have a phone which is fine. It’s 16+ and you have to have a job to pay for phone bills. That’s fine by my standards. 

However, my friend had turned that age and she has a job at a local store. So she does have the funds to pay their phone bill and they have do WiFi at home. She was finally given her phone and we were able to text easily.  

Texting is easier than having to physically walk over to the place (which is a mile away) and see if she’s home.  

Age had their phone for a while until it was taken away for no reason. They didn’t misbehave or anything (this is isnt the first time something like that this happened I’ll explain further). They had came over to my house, their sibling comes with her every time they come over.  Which is strange because there’s no one around their age to play with any of my siblings.  It’s really weird.  My two younger brothers are two young to play with the sibling while my two older siblings are older.  

I had asked about her phone and they said it was taken away for no reason. I asked if she had misbehaved possibly and she said no.  She said her parents decided to take away her phone despite meeting their requirements of the ability to have a phone.  

Then I asked what if there’s like an emergency and you need a phone (they drives alone to work late at night around 10 in a rural ghetto sorta neighborhood.) she had stated that her parents told her if it happened she should knock on every door to get help which is totally unsafe for a 16 year old girl to go to strangers houses let alone at around 10 PM.  However the houses are like at least a mile apart in this area.   

She then told me another story where her headlights had once gone out.  She didn’t have a flashlight or a phone for that matter, she had to drive on the pitch black.  

Another case where I suspect abuse is once I was over at her house, one of their kids (who has a problem) had wet their pants.  They began to scream at them for wetting his pants and told him to wash up. However I read that like screaming at young children for wetting their pants is bad. However this kid is slightly older. 

Another was I invited her to see a Disney movie. Her parents agreed to let her go the day before.  She was excited since she had wanted to see the movie. 
Next day we go to pick her up and she has tears in her eyes saying she couldn’t go at all. Later a few days ago I went to her house and asked about the movie.  She stated she didn’t get in trouble and her parents decided to not let her see the movie. 


So basically having a phone is good for safety. What if she got into a car crash? She couldn’t call for help. Even a. Flip up phone could be used but she doesn’t have that. I wouldn’t want my future 16 year old daughter walk at night all alone or drive at night alone with creepy people who are out there in the world."
Asking a girl for her number,So I asked this girl for her number. (She speaks only spanish very little english while i speak only english and very little spanish) I did this using google translate. She then wrote she didnt know how to write what she wanted to say. Was this like a friend zone? Is she trying to say she dosent like me or has a boyfriend?
To Teenagers in a Toxic Relationship,"Hi. I would like to share my story of my toxic relationship. I am creating this post to inspire people who know deep down they need to leave a relationship but think they don't have the courage, or think they will regret it. 

I currently will be turning 20 next month (I'm female). when I was 17, I started dating this guy. I was really into him. 

Soon enough, he began telling me things to make me jealous. he would tell me when he thought girls were attractive, he told me there was a cute girl in his class that he considered being with instead, and that there was a girl in another class who would always stare at him and that he began to have feelings for her but was ""fighting it off."" he told me I had to be more enthusiastic over text, or else he would start having feelings for other girls. once he even told me he ""would be tempted to hang out with other girls"" if I went to visit my friend at college. He told me he was having feelings of breaking up with me, but was trying to fight them off, putting the burden on me to help him figure it out. He has made me cry COUNTLESS times. each time I did bring it up, and he would start crying and tell me he was sorry and that he did care for me, and that he was tempted to harm himself if I broke up with him. I KNEW deep down that I should break it off, but I didn't want to. It was my very first relationship and I thought I might regret it if I broke up with him. I really thought this was the person I was going to end up with. Hell was I wrong. 

Every terrible thing he has told me, he would say, ""I promise I didn't say it to make you jealous"" and then after a while, he would confess and say he did, indeed, say it for that reason. He would tell me I need to show more physical affection, and that because of this, he is tempted to date others. That's fine, that he wants someone who shows more physical affection, but it's a shitty thing to do to put the burden on me and making me feel like I need to fix that part of myself. It was things like this that made me feel bad about who I was. I was incredibly stressed out over these things he constantly told me. I lost sleep, and I stopped caring about pretty much everything else. all I wanted was for him to accept me as I was, but instead he was constantly putting me down and making me feel absolutely worthless. 

My dad was my hero with this. We went to a target parking lot and I cried and he comforted me. 

From this shit show of a relationship, I have trust issues, a heightened anxiety, and overall regret and frustration. I am so angry that I let him do all that to me, and this is why I am posting this. if you are experiencing a similar thing, PLEASE FOLLOW YOUR GUT. The entire time, my gut was telling me ""end this now. End this now. End this now."" but I didn't listen. It was my first relationship, and I truly thought we would last forever, even though my gut told me I was not doing the smart thing. I KNEW this was a bad idea to continue on with this person. I KNEW no one should treat me this way. 

And last thing. Let me tell you. Now, looking back on it, it is INSANE to realize how differently I feel. I am so secure with my decision. Once I left him, it was like a breath of fresh air. It took some time, of course; it took a few weeks, but once I truly realized it, it's like I can't believe I ever wanted to stay with him. When you're in the stage of ""I am infatuated with this person; I want to work it out with them"" you really do not realize how much better it will feel letting them go. But when you're out of that stage for a while, after breaking it off, you truly realize what a wonderful decision you've made. Never again will I let someone treat me this way. This was definitely a learning lesson in my life. So once again, please, if you're experiencing something similar, PLEASE follow what your gut says and if you're being treated wrongly like I was, END IT NOW. I promise, you will NOT regret it. I really hope this inspires just one person. feel free to pm me if you want to chat."
I don’t know how to change,"I’ve had crappy people as friends my whole life. My insecurities control my life. I can have a good time with some people but I think I just get sick of them. I’m about to turn 16 M. I hated every single year of my life in school. I hated school so much that I got admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Now I’m at a smaller school and trying to recover credits. I like to believe I’m usually a really nice guy but I know I have anger issues with others and especially to my self. I don’t have a problem talking to people I don’t know but either I’m not motivated to do so because everything is good for a bit but shit usually always goes south. People make me feel shitty I wish I could spend the rest of my life locked away. Maybe I can have the courage to end it one day but I know my family loves me. Life just feels like complete bs. I understand why people don’t last long around me. If I could leave me I would too. Never dated, was bullied and constantly I get reminded of everything I’m not and everything I haven’t done
Edit: I also have a bad porn addiction because it seems to be the only thing that makes me feel better yet I tell myself to stop but I relapse. I don’t do drugs but I do take prescription meds"
Help me decide if I should spend money on a new tooth or not!,"Ok the title is pretty funny ngl but I actually need your guy’s opinion on this serious matter.

Background: i am a senior in high school and i just got my braces taken off a few months ago after having them for like 6 years. I also do not have my upper left incisor tooth (the one right next to your front tooth) because my mouth was too small and it had to get pulled. 

So when I got my braces off, I had to get a retainer with a bar across the front of my teeth with a tooth attached (so It looked like I still have all my teeth).  I didn’t mind the retainer too much bc I figured i could live with the bar across my teeth for a month for so. Then, my doctor just told me that I will have to wait until the end of April to get my actual implant so I will have to keep the retainer with the bar across the front until then.

I hate to smile with my teeth and I am very self conscious about having my retainer in all the time. I realize this sounds stupid but I just feel like the only person in the world that has to wear a retainer and that doesn’t have a perfect, metal free mouth. And again, I know it might sound dumb but this retainer really impacts my self confidence. I thought that when I got my braces off, my hatred for my smile would stop, but now that I am supposed to wear this for longer makes me want to cry.

Although, my doctor gave me the option of keeping the retainer with the bar across the  front of the teeth for the next 3 months OR getting a retainer without a bear across the front with a tooth still attached but for $250

I do have the money (my parents aren’t paying for it) but I worry that I’m spending a lot of money on something that I will use for 3 months only. BUT I am going to a trip to London and Paris in the beginning of April and I really really do not want to go there looking and feeling like this.

So, I need to decide if I should keep my retainer with the bar across the teeth OR buy the $250 one without the bar?

Pls tell me what you would do!!!!"
Periods,Okay so I just got my period this month yesterday it came fairly early and I have the worst cramps I’ve ever had in my life and I bled through a tampon and a pad what should I do?!!

Hello this is my first time here,I am 14 years old I’m in high school and me and this girl have been dating for 2 months now and I really love her and I feel like she delivers that same loving energy back but me and this girl get into arguments pretty often and I’m always the first one that apologizes and sometimes I feel like that doesn’t even work and I try to show her that I love her with my actions and at this point I’m just confused cause I really love this girl and I feel like this one is the one but at the same time I’m not sure because all my last relationship I’ve been cheated on and I’m just looking for advice that would help me last long with this girl because I reallly do love her like I would do anything for this girl some advice pls
19 (M) Looking for advice.,"I recently broke up with my girlfriend of a year, and now i feel so lost. I don’t know what to do with my time nowadays, all I do is work, go home to sit in my truck and just wait for the next day. I already suffer from severe anxiety and depression and I don’t have any close friends now besides the 2 or 3 people I occasionally smoke with. I just was wondering if anyone had any advice for meeting new people/ making new friends. I’d like to figure out who I really am and what my true interests are but I just don’t know what to do with myself. Any advice please?"
Confused,"Im 22 and there was a female who we were little more than fwb, there were mutual feelings but never acted upon them. Now after basically ghosting me for several months she messages me sending signals like before, slightly flirting. I offer to come smoke her out but she says ""im kinda seeing someone, i think we should match from now on"". Im so confused like why add me back flirting just to say. There is no way her and me could just me friends. Not sure how to approach the situation. I just ""aight just lmk wassup"". Not sure what else to say."
I’m sick of my parents doubting me,"I’m in college, currently in my junior year. My parents keep doubting that I’ll be able to get a job on my own and they believe they have to give me/get me one. It’s beyond frustrating, I’m a perfectly capable kid, I have a fellowship lined up for the next two semesters as well as an internship over the summer. I network with my professors and TA’s and will be getting my resume underway this semester. I just hate how my dad keeps thinking I can’t get anywhere without him. I’m sick of them having a hand in everything I do. I just want to find my way without them forcing me into this or that which they have done my whole life. I want separation and independence."
Moving out young,Okay so I want to move out of my house as soon as I’m 18 but I’m not too sure where to start. For those reddit users that moved out young if any can you give me any tips or advice as to what to start with this is really important to me thank you. I also have a buddy or 2 that may want to join me as well because obviously I can’t do this alone and I’m also 17 about to graduate soon as well as I turn 18

My Father read my WhatsApp Chat,"So i left my phone with my dad for a few hours and he somehow knew the password.
I come back and he hands me the phone back without saying anything.
I later check my screen time and find that he looked at my WhatsApp for a little more than an hour!!!!
The problem is that there was this awkward chat with my crush where i had told her about my 'made up' girlfriend 😶 and told her all sorts of things related to that 'made up' gf (why i did that is a different story leave that for now plz).
That chat (it was all done by one of my friends cause i didn't wanna make that story and things like that) contained some things like how close we were (it's all fake.... nothing physical ... probably a kiss idk but still ...that i was quite close to her ..u know) and now i know that he read it all😭.... I don't know what to do...he didn't say anything and probably thinks that it all was me whereas it's all fake and plus written by my friend....and i feel very weird about it all😔.
I never did it yet he will think that it was me!
He won't say anything i know but what will he think of me😭.
Should i talk to him about it(will be very hard for me) or what should i do????

P.s.- I don't if it's normal for many but i don't have this type of image Infront of my parents and am pretty stressed about what will he think of me..!!"
How do I uninvite my friend from something she’s already invited to?,"So I (19F) have a friend (19F) who I’ve been friend with for over 7 years. We used to be best friends but recently things are gone SUPER downhill. At this point, she is just intolerable to be around. She’s an alcoholic, a compulsive liar, manipulative, depressed and more. I’m not saying this to be mean, it’s 100% true. I have tried getting her help NUMEROUS times, but she refuses every time. 
We have made a bunch of plans for the future, I still want to go to all the plans with my friends, just not with her. Her coming literally makes doing anything unenjoyable. 
She is friends with all my friends (all 19F) ... but my friends are done with her too. We feel bad basically. We don’t want to really be her friend anymore but we feel like we can’t completely ditch her because of her problems. 

Things I need her uninvited from:
- concerts 
- a vacation 
- clubs

Please help!! Any idea is a good idea at this point."
I think i have SOMETHING,"Ok so i’ve been thinking i have depression and/or anxiety, which are probably the causes of my medical issues rn, but my mom won’t even let me talk so what do i even do in this situation, because i wanna ask her about me seeing a doctor to be tested for it"
I'm in several pickles,So theres a girl that thinks shes my side chick and knows I have a girlfriend. Were close tho and I dont know how to tell her I like her but csnt be in a relationship. I'm really stressing about this right now
Friend Advice Please!!,"So recently, my friend got into a new relationship with one of the boys in our class who has liked her for a while. They never kept it a secret, but they only told a few people they were together, and that later spread. Once the ""popular"" group caught wind, they decided to talk to her boyfriend and about her and why he was dating her (I say popular in quotations because they aren't really popular, they're just a large friend group that has been together all through kindergarten, but most of the new kids who come into this group think they are popular because of the way they act.) Anyway, apparently a few of these ""popular"" kids and rando people in our class think that my friend is not good enough for him because she won't give him anything. My friend's bf told her about this and once she heard this, she has been very down lately, but she thinks she needs to confront them about talking about her behind her back to her bf. However, once getting advice from her bf, he told her not to tell them about it, because that would only create more drama, and he thinks it would backfire. What should my friend do, because she's decided to dm them, but realized that talking them in person would be easier, but she's very introverted so she wouldn't know how to confront them."
Help me!!!, So I have been crushing on this girl for a while and I only recently hung out with her one on one. And we hit it off great it seemed to go really well. But the problem is I don’t know if she thinks of me as a friend or more than. Also if she thinks of me as a friend is that subject to change but I also don’t want to push her away. To sum it up how do I figure out if she likes me or not without loosing her as a friend?
Happy New Year!?,"Sooo my life is a total mess atm. On new year's eve me and my friends went  for a drink .Drunk too much said things I shouldn't have to a girl.The  next day one of my friends whom I considered close showed some of the text messages I sent him about that girl to her bf and her. So yeah we wont be hearing from him in a while (my ""friend"")

my mother and i,"I just started crying in front of my mom today for several reasons but none of which my mom thinks it is. I might think nothing of this tomorrow and will probably delete this post tomorrow but for now, I need a source to get it out somewhere so I can study.

  
I come from an old school Korean background so it's typical for moms to not really listen to personal stories of their children unless under VERY special circumstances. My mom is pretty nice and unique so she likes to be more friend-like with me so we talk (one way) to each other a lot (and I'm an only child so things can get boring). I like to tell my mom frustrating stories of my friends which I empathize about because it's fun and sometimes helpful to hear her opinion. She rarely does give any comments to any of my stories. My mom's not the type of person who speaks a few words, in fact, she talks a lot. The problem is she likes to talk a lot about things she wants to according to her mood. I've always been matching myself to riding her tide in a conversation and I feel like that habit gets her into some trouble at work. 

  
Recently, I've been \*blossoming\* into my late teens and my relationship with my mom has gotten better. Amid my puberty, we were literally at each others' necks (ok, well, to be fair she entered menopause too). When I'm giving her one of my stories of the day, the glint in her eye tells me she's somewhere else in her world. I don't know if it is because I'm still immature or not, but I find this unfair. For years I've been listening to her stories whether I liked it or not but that's not exactly the reason why I'm upset. My mom likes to do many activities after work, like exercising, shopping and learning more English (through Netflix shows). I'm totally okay with my mom wanting to do the activities she wants to do but I just wish she would listen to some of my stories. I never ask her to listen to what I'm stressing about at school because that makes me more stressed out, but I just want her to listen to one of my random stories. This really helps out a lot. On purpose, I try not to talk to her when she's busy doing something at home or when she's enjoying her free time. I only try to talk to her when we're finishing off dinner and that's when she's in her greatest mood. For all the Asians out there, you might tell me to suck it up, but I really don't have anyone to talk to because this kind of links to family stuff that I don't want to share and my dad worked far away since I was small so I don't feel any connections to him (all he talks about, IF he does, is world history which is probably inaccurate on his side).  
I've tried to seriously talk to my mom about it, but she would make a huge turn in the conversation and scold me for something recently I did wrong, which is always linked to Korean manners and I always don't understand what I did wrong because I was born in Canada. 

  
I know talking about this sounds like boasting but compared to other kids I don't really ask for much (although I should ask myself about why my marks are like that in school). I earn my own spending money and the only time I really get anything from my parents is during Christmas and my birthday (and those two are in close proximity so I really just get one big gift). This excludes the afterschool activities I go to and the very few vacations I went on when I was younger.  
My mom likes to focus on how much money she spends on me because I go to extra math classes after school. What I really want is for her to realize my mental health would do so much better if she could listen to my random (maybe boring) stories once every day for a maximum of 15 mins.

  
Oh, and my mom only listens to me when I give her advice about socializing at work (she's bad at it and she admits it too). I really don't like that because my mom knows I have scarring memories from fRiEnDs using me as an advice bot. 

  
How can I get the message across to my mom that I need a little time to vent in front of her?"
I don’t know what to do with my grumpy dad,"Hey guys,

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to deal with my dad. He’s always yelling at me and he rarely ever smiles. 
He is always grumpy and angry and he never ask anything in a polite way, he just starts yelling at me that I should’ve done something, even if I did something else (like chore) or if I’m injured (walking hurts due to my knee being hurt). 
He’s always been somewhat aggressive towards me and my brother but I’ve always been the one he seems to care the least about. He scares me sometimes as well. 
I genuinely feel like he doesn’t care about me because I have the same character as he does, and my family feels like he does not like it as well. 
Can somebody please give advice?

Ps. 
Sorry for the weird sentence-things but I’m not sure what to write."
I’m starting to hate my mom,Ok for background information It used to just be me my mom and my two brothers my dad was an abusive drug addict who spent most of my like in and out of jail they have been divorced since I was probably 3 I’m 16 now and my mom starting dating this guy around 8 years ago and we have lived with him and his son for about 6 years and my mom had literally become insane since being with him he’s a few years older than her the same as my dad and like she is constantly starting arguments and hitting him and breaking stuff he is a nice guy never just her back or anything but she is like crazy now and I hate being around her for context of how my mom is last year they were arguing about a bathroom window being left open it wasn’t a big deal at all but she made it one she kicked down their bedroom door and threw it at him it was a thin hollow door but still who tf reacts like that and it was mine and my brothers bathroom so it definitely wasn’t him that opened the window but anyways earlier tonight I was asleep and I woke up to screaming because my mom wanted the dog to go in her cage to sleep my dog isn’t aggressive and could have very easily put the dog up herself but ofc she wanted to make a big deal out of it so I obviously being annoyed came out of my room and asked why everything needs to be an argument and she fucking runs up the stairs and start screaming at me about how she’s tired of all of us and she hates us I swear every time I’m in a good mood and I get around her I end up crying in the bathroom I really don’t know what to do I’m so tired of being around her my mom used to be such a nice person she wasn’t like this at all I don’t think anyone is even gonna read to the end if this but please I need advice and I have nobody else to talk to about this

I need advice on an argument with my mom,"Hey everyone. So recently I had an argument with my mom. Basically my mom and I don’t really get along great generally. The other day I was doing my homework. Mind you I always have a lot of homework due to the fact that I’m in high school and take many advanced classes. Anyways across the hall to my room is my brothers room. He is 14 and games. He was non stop talking very loudly to his friends on the mic and periodically yelling. I don’t have a door and neither does he so, I could here everything clear. I had asked him nicely to stop 2 or three times. He ignored I even said anything. Then I yelled for him to be quiet. My mother heard me yell and starting yelling at me to stop from downstairs to stop and that I was breeching her peace and to be quiet. I explained I was trying to do my homework and my brother wasn’t being quiet at all. She said he can play the Xbox whenever he wants and told me not to do my homework the last minute. She was aggressively telling me this. I was not doing my homework last min. I was doing it at the end of break because I wanted to enjoy my Christmas break. Doing it the last two days of my break gave me enough time to do my homework therefore it was not last minute. I said that is crazy and unfair. She then came upstairs and continued to yell at me saying she would call the cops on me. I said the cops would call her stupid for calling about me yelling at my brother to stop yelling. She said “NO YOUR BREECHING MY PEACE THATS A FELONY” I said you insane let me do my work leave me alone. She continued to yell saying he can play when he wants. She was mad at me for doing my homework while he was playing. I said he can play but I want him to be quiet. She continued to say he can play whenever. She said I’ve had 2 weeks to do my homework. I said he’s had 2 weeks to play the game. She replied yelling “NO no your doing it last minute he can play whenever he wants this is your fault. I continued to yell you’re crazy that’s not fair leave me alone let me work. She then ripped down my curtain rod my door that I got for Xmas (not from her) she didn’t get me anything and broke it, leaving me with nothing to cover my door way. Then she left. story of my life. Then she goes and talks with her friends, propaboy lieing about the situation. I hear her whispering to them today about it and say “it’s just the age” I’m so confused am I in the wrong here. Please help. When my older brother ever needed silence for work she enforced it always."
I’m not feeling so good,"My girlfriend of nearly a year broke up with me a week before Christmas and I haven’t been taking it well I’ve fell into a bad place and I’m really scared I can’t get out of the house I can’t eat I can’t sleep it’s horrible. I also have a very large history or depression anxiety suicide and anorexia. I was also in a mental health hospital of almost a year. And the worst thing is she was my only friend, so now I literally have no one, and I’m really scared of the feeling I am experiencing now because I know from experience what they have led me to do. I just want someone to talk to"
feelings dude,"How do I deal with feelings

I feel. I feel a LOT for this guy. I am also a guy. Do I ask him out/confess, or wait for him to make a move? (The rest is lowkey a rant) My feelings get so clouded, and I push away anything that could mean he reciprocates it. I have a lot of it, but I push it away so I don’t risk anything. He’s also one of my very best friends. I can’t read him, but maybe he does. He says he trusts me the most out of our friends, and we always plan things together. He wants me involved in his life, like his friends and gaming. He sends me memes and puts in a pretty good effort into our friendship. His eyes dilate when we talk but it could be the sun. I don’t know. I don’t want to risk our relationship either. We’re pretty close.. I don’t want to lose him as a friend. What do I do in this situation? And what do y’all think?"
What to do with my life...😁,"My mom and I got in a physical altercation earlier this year and life's been messy since then. I was always a good student but I have two uncompleted classes from that semester. I have mourned the death of out relationship (that was never really there or never capable of being there) and I understand my mom more and what she went through, why she is the way she is. I'm living with a long time friend a couple days a week and plan to move in there when I turn 18 while I go to school, get myself together, and decide what I want to do. After two years of community college I'll decide where to finish school wether I wanna move out of state or what I wanna pursue/if I have a serious relationship I want to follow. My friends mom has been a huge resource through this process and her view was that getting Social Services involved could be benificial for my mom getting the help she needs bc it's hard for her to exist in the world. She once told me she's exoirienced every ACE (Adverse Childhood Expirience) and so I know both she and my dad are trying their best but it's not good enough to be suficient parents. (My dad's verbally abusive which I am reading can have lasting affects that outweight or equal physical abuse but he is a stable parent, comes from a more stable family, is resonable in comparison and doesn't have mental health issues other than anxiety which makes him indecisive and submissive to mi mom) Her and her siblings were removed from their home when she was abiut 15 and she moved out on her own with a family she knew... i feel like I might be her but that is ok if I can be a little *less* her. All I want is to be happy. They are always confused on what they want. And take their problems out on me every day it kinda sucks. In deciding what I want to do with my life (and this situation) I talked to multiple caseworkers, gathered information and concluded that it is essentially (at this moment) not usefull to get social servuce involved because it would either a) only complicate things b) if I were removed from my home be put in foster case or c)emacipation is nearly imposible in the state I live in and even if possible a social worker told me that most teens end up worse off aka homeless or struggling with different things. It is hard to live in an unsafe enviroment but that enviroment could be just as unsafe. Right now I am thinking my best bet is to keep learning about personality disorders to understand my mom and hey maybe it'll lead me to a career (maybe not but at least I can share the knowedge with others to help them in the future). They only part that is really hard for me is that I think I can orevent anything from happening to put me in danger but this means that I have to bend to my mom's every mood and that means that I can't really commit to anything, I can't really build anything that is substantial and stable like being in a relationship or anything else that is planned. She refuses to schedule anythign and that means outside of school I can't have anything reliable and that I have to come whenever she calls for fear of anything bad. She does a lot of normal parenting things for the wrong reasons. I know this has/will/might cause a lot of issues for me so I am weighing my options supper carefully but the alternative (going to SS) from my research could possibly be just as problematic/traumatizing. All my options seem ahrd but I feel like there's got to be a third option. I want to get out of this. I want to have a happy prosperous life and I am willing to do anything to get it. 
Any tips or advice? Anyone see a third option? 
Also would you say it would be bad or benificial for me to be in a relationship in this situation? I feel like it could be unfair to the other person thought they know me well so I feel it could either be a really positice thing or go terribly wrong. Lemme know if you have any thoughts!
How do I heal after I get out of this?
Am I throwing away my life? Will I really be able to pull myself together if I wait this out and all I have to show for it is a bunch of journals filled with depressive stuff and ig some life lessons:)
Thanks for anything🙏"
"Sooooo I went to hang out with the teachers son, turned out it was a date and was REALLY touchy, turns out he was doing the same thing he did with his ex-GF","So the teacher’s son(who I had been texting for a year and had met up with 4 times) asked me to go to the movies to HANG OUT so I said sure. We got food before and he put his arm around me a couple times but let go quickly, obviously nervous.

When we got there he put his hand on my thigh and I acted as if I didn’t notice. Once the movie started I put my hand near his and he grabbed it and held it. Then he put his arms around me and put his head on my shoulder, eventually he started lightly kissing(and I mean I couldn’t even feel it I thought it was an accident) my neck, hair and shoulder. I was trying to lean away from him(so his head wasn’t resting on my shoulder) but he had his arm around me so I couldn’t.

I went to the bathroom to freak out to my friends. When I came back I grabbed his hand and held it. He started rubbing my thigh, slowly inching up and kissing my shoulder leaning his head on my shoulder for a second and then sitting back up. His hand got really close to my crotch and I tensed up, he noticed and stopped about 2 inches away from my crotch(*). Then leaving the theatre I grabbed his hand and held it. He was fully aware I had never dated anyone before so I thought this was normal first date things. 

After I wanted to know what he was thinking so I texted him and he replied(his old Gf is called Chloe)
“Idk I basically acted like I acted when I was with Chloe and when I realised that in fact you are not Chloe and that you are different it was too late but by then you had reciprocated and then I just went with it”

So I acted like he didn’t just say that and went along with it, until I told him I didn’t want to be a rebound, he said I wasn’t but he knew why I would think that. I basically just went off on his and we argued for another hour. Then after all that we both kept saying “we can just be friends if you want” and then I eventually said that and he replied “ok gn” and I said “goodbye and sorry”. I eventually apologised(**). 

Aftermath:
I cried a couple tears because I didn’t want to stop dating him, but then I realised I didn’t really like him, or maybe I do? I’m not really sure tbh. He still likes me and thinks I like him. I’m keeping up with this whole ‘just being friends’ with him and it’s going really well.

WHAT I NEED ADVICE ON:
Did I overreacted? So now what? Do I tell him? Keep him thinking I like him just incase I change my mind? Do I like him? Did he act inappropriately? If i do like him should I let it continue? I NEED HELP



* He actually ended up apologised for that after via text and I said it was fine but he said he was really sorry. I’m still fine about it he was watching the movie and wasn’t paying any attention, don’t know why he didn’t just move his hand down after tho.

** I said “Look, I’m really sorry about yesterday. I wasn’t really angry at you thinking I was Chloe or whatever I was more upset that I reciprocated and you didn’t want that. One of my friends says that I tend to ‘deflect my problems into other people’ or ‘blame myself for things that aren’t my fault’ so I think that’s what just happened. Sorry. Also I’m off my pill and it’s shark week so I’m incredibly impulsive and all of my emotions are revved up, complete with mood swings. I know it’s not really an excuse but just thought it was relevant information.”"

Life advice?,"So New Years just passed and I just went on a former close friend on mine’s instagram page and I was just on social media in general (and before I even finish this, please don’t give me, “everyday goes through life at a different pace”) I noticed that her and other people seem to have actual lives. She performs songs plays, etc , has a relationship etc. and me? No guy had ever looked my way, my life is literally wake up , school, come home, homework, rinse and repeat. I also have social anxiety so it’s hard for me to go out and even then still, I think I’m grossly unattractive. Have never ever taken a good picture, last picture I took was for the school yearbook months ago. I simply just don’t take pictures. I feel behind everyone and everything. I realize how at my age this decade is literally the decade on change for my generation, but I haven’t don’t anything. Never been kissed, held hands, complimented, looked at. And it doesn’t help that I’m a dark skin girl and nowadays boys and men seem to go out of their way especially black men, to point out how they believe dark skin girls are unattractive in all ways. I just feel behind. I mean the girl I was talking about was the girl I did everything with in elementary and middle school till we moved for high school and she had the most basic things that I can’t even get. I mean high schoolers get to y’all about relationships, and me, I’m here too ugly to even be given a second glance. 2020 is off to the worst possible start.i want to be someone’s first choice. I have friends but I know I’m not their first choice, I feel like the leftover friend. I feel like if life is literally not happening for me, I shouldn’t even be alive, what’s the point. And I release that yes I need to go out there, but how do I do that when my head is constantly telling me all my flaws, from the shape of my nose to the darkness of my skin, to my introverted personality. I feel defeated, cause I don’t want this life if it’s all I’m getting, watching every body progress and experience while I’m stuck and I feel I can’t get out."
Thoughts on what to do or feel about friends?,"My group of my friends and I were talking and I ended up bringing up something that really affected me and was really personal. One of my friends began making jokes at my expense, and I got really upset. I asked them to stop, but they kept going and laughing at me, even after I began to tear up and had to go inside in order to not cry. A few days have passed since then, and the friend who joked about me hasn’t brought it up, and probably won’t ever bring it up or change his behavior or apologize. Because of that, I want to leave my friend group. But, am I being too sensitive here, wanting to leave over one thing one person said? Should I give things more time? I’m kind of biased so I need some advice from someone else. Any thoughts are very helpful, thanks."
I need advice on this friendship,"Theres this girl I've been friends with for over a year now and it started back in june 2019 when she was supposed to go to this place with me for a week well at last minute she went home and it was early in the morning and we  Leaving As we were in the hotel Room she  Text is mean a bunch of pictures of this girl and her and saying how much fun she's having knowing I'm in this hotel Room by myself but I was like OK don't matter then a day later sends me a picture of this guy she says she likes him and wants me to talk to him well she adds me into a group chat with him and has the last name of my sisters husband so I asked if he was related to my sisters husband and he says yes that made the girl really mad she stopped talking to me and me and my cousin got really close and he and her got into a fight  
And then me and her got into a fight so we called the friendship off a month later its July and were supposed to go to camp so were both in the same cabin and was in the same color group so we decided to be friends after camp got into more fights school came around more fights now its January next month would be 2 years and we just decided to be friends again and weve already had 3 fights the first one was about how I dont believe in the god everyone praises but I believe theres a god up there and she starts telling me how the bible is real and everything about god she makes an account that she told me to look at talking about how god saved her and everything  well I let that go and then today she calls me fake and then proceeds to text me about how shes looking up unhealthy friend ships but please I need advice can someone message me or comment"
I want to get revenge on a guy. Should I? How can I legally do it?,"This guy who screwed my mental health more than it was has been making me angry for never getting what he deserves, I’ve changed school now and I want him to know that he messed with someone he shouldn’t (without him knowing who was), maybe just ruining his day or just one minute of his life. 

My older brother has told me that it’s wrong to think this way, but I cannot help it.

What should I do?

I might provide certain information about me if anyone has an idea of anything I can do. And I won’t mind if someone tries to help me stop thinking like this (this might sound contradicting but I really want to get revenge or feel calm with myself)

I ask reddit because you give great advice, thanks."
I need help,So there’s these two girls that I like and one of them told me they liked me but I still want to see if the other one likes me
How to make best friend like me again,"My best friend is mad at me. I mean we started talking again, but when I asked them if we're friends again they just said ""idk"". What can I do to help them like me again? I said sorry, I tried to give them cakes and cookies but they said they didn't even want it. I've done ""gross things"" for them and that kinda help, but what more can I do? :("
Ex Bestfriend,We had a friend group which was me my ex bsf and two other friends we were pretty close but my ex bsf always said if we created a group chat to not add her cause she was really busy so over this summer i created a group chat but i didn’t add her. It was just me and the other two friends. Everything was going great my ex bsf and me became closer over the summer but that soon came to an end on October she found out we had made a group chat without her so one of my other friends made a group chat including her and everything was fine until a few days later she got all mad and ignored us for 2 weeks and even unfollowed all of us. I decided to confront her about it and she ended up saying that she was mad because we added her to a group chat after we realized that she wasn’t in the other one. It’s been almost three months since that happened we haven’t actually texted since. We’ve invited her to a few events but she never showed up. she said she needs time to think but it has been almost three months should i just move or do i try one more time or should I just wait and see if she ever has an answer? I never really apologized for what I did i know i was in the wrong.
A girl is ignoring me...,Why? 😔
I’m 17. I need advice.,"To everyone else I’m strong, confident, a leader. I walk around like nothing bothers me and I just live my life. When I’m alone. That whole persona of me shatters. I turn into this alone, Unhappy, Hurt, toxic person. I don’t know why it happens. I don’t know how to fix it. I hurt the people closest to me. I admit it’s a problem. I just wanna fix it."
I need other people’s opinions so I know what to do,"Aita for being dumb

Ok so this started back in early December on Snapchat when I added my crush and started talking to her. Context we’re both 17 and I met her at my old school 3 years ago before I moved 2 years ago, we weren’t very close but we kinda knew each other. But anyways this convo started out when I asked her if she remembered me she said no. (Red flag 1) but my dumb self didn’t think about that. But we talked for a little bit after that and she eventually said she remembered who I was after hearing about some of the classes we were in together and other stuff and after that we talked some more. About 3 days later when I was over at a friends party drunk and high off my ass I decided it was a good idea with my drunk self to confess how I felt since freshman year. And how did that go. Awkwardly as fuck. She said I don’t know you which with my drunk self I didn’t think was a no but I was drunk so I started asking other questions like if she already had a bf or if she was interested in one or why not. Ps she said no she didn’t have a bf, that she really just felt like doing her own thing and just because she didn’t feel like it. But when I woke up sober the next morning I texted her a apology and didn’t get a response so I kinda just went on about my day. After that day though for like the last 2 weeks I decided I was going to give up on being her bf and just try to be her friend. I tried a way too often to try and start conversations by saying things like hi or what’s up or stuff like that and sending streaks or sending good morning or goodnight. But either way this went on for about 2 weeks without any responses until yesterday where she unfriended me on snap but still let me follow her on Instagram.  So I sent a paragraph long apology on Instagram and now I’m waiting to see if she’ll look at it or not. I’m emotionally confused, is there anything I can do to fix this situation or is it just done if you read thanks and please if you can leave honest feedback. Ps I don’t know if this is the right area for this but it seemed like it"
My “best” friend has been ignoring me.,"My “best” friend has been ignoring me

Me and my best friend have been friends for 4 years, we took her to see a concert for Panic At The Disco for her 16th birthday. She was my friend when I stopped seeing my father and has been there for me. Over the summer I took her to counseling (which my mom payed for) because she was self harming and super depressed. That was in June. 

She moved away to Baltimore and has been doing A LOT better, she’s not depressed, not self harming and recovering from an eating disorder. 

In August we got into a HEATED argument over what I’m going to tell you today. And we stopped talking for two months. 

Recently she hasn’t been texting me. She’s been ignoring me and leaving me on read, she doesn’t text me unless she has something to talk about. Any time I have something to talk about it’s always “that’s nice/cool/good” or if I’m sad “I’m sorry” and then change the subject. When SHE is having problems I try to come up with solutions to her problems and when she’s excited about something I try to act excited also. 

She’s stopped referring to me as her best friend and only her friend whereas I call her my best friend. 

Last night I texted her this: 
“i love you and I know you probably don’t but I do and I don’t want to ever lose you again so I’m gonna keep fighting to keep you in my life even if you don’t want to be in my life anymore I’ll still fight to keep you in it because I love you so much and you’re my best friend even if I’m not yours” (I copied and pasted it) and she left me on read and hasn’t answered me. But she’s been sending me Tik toks all day through the app. 

I know people can grow apart, it just hurts so much when you’ve done so much for someone, spend hundreds on them (she used to spend weekends with us because her parents kicked her out and we’d take her out to eat a lot. Which my mom couldn’t afford any ways.) and it feels like it’s all thrown away. 

Please help me. What do I do? I don’t want to loose her. I’m just scared of confronting her about it because I know she’ll get mad."
How do I come out to my parents that I’m having problems? (read the post),"So like, I’m in a spot of trouble. 
Background I’m 14 biological male. 

For like maybe 5 ish years, I’ve been thinking if my life would be better as a female. I personally HATE with almost all of my being the male human race. I can abide being male. I haven’t started anything in terms of the process to go trans; I haven’t even told anyone. 

I can’t decide if I want to be trans (FTM), and if i do decide, how should I come out? Is it wise to do so now at 14; am I too late?

I need advice because I can’t keep living how I am now."
Life right now isn't great,"The series of events that lead to muy current situation of discontent with muy life begins in September of last year, I went abroad to Canada for 11th grade, in the time I was in Canada (which was on itself a rather unpleasant time) everything changed back home.

Before I left for Canada my best friend stopped being friends with me after 13 years of friendship because ""my family and I were a bunch of ungrateful people for what he had done for me all these years"" and other stuff he said influenced to him deciding to stop being my friend. So after this I only had 3 friends left (I am not very sociable person and tend to be very shy with people) which are good friends, but the thing is that in my year in Canada they started to hang out with people I don't get with. So by the time I came back from that horrendous place they had over 20 friends all of which I don't know or dislike.

So 12 grade starts and slowly but surely I start to realise that I honestly have no friends for my 3 are always with this other people, I don't speak to anyone in my classroom and if I do is just because they spoke to me just to laugh at what I say or do. Plus the girl I like who likes and thinks literally exactly the same way I do, thinks I'm kind of a creep because I don't talk that much. 

All of this plus bad grades and pressure at home to decide what I want to study in college is destroying me."
I don't want to go to school,"English is not my native language, so sorry if I made a lot of mistakes.
I'm in my first year in high school, in my country it's ninth class, and I can't get used to high school after middle school.
I was a loved student, I wasn't the best and I was not very successful but my teachers liked for who I am, but now even when I wave at them because I want to say hello to them, they think I am a teachers pet.
And I can't make friends, I tried my best but, none of them really liked me, nor I liked them. I don't think I am truly a bad person, nor them but we don't match each other.
I got into the school I really wanted but my family made me change my school so, I don't like my school either.
I am not brilliant but I'm not stupid. I can easily understand something by myself. I offered my family to be homeschooled and they told they will consider this.
I have three older sibling, two sisters and one brother. They think I am being dramatic but I really don't want to go to school, I don't want to be alone and I don't want to be a loser.
What are your thoughts about this situation?"
Increase in pimples?,"Just like my mother, I’ve only had about two pimples at most at the same time. However I currently have nearly 10, I’ve never had this happen before. I haven’t had any diet changes, although my diet isn’t necessarily the best, I’m confused as to why I suddenly have so many? I’ve been stressed recently, but I have been for the past few years. Does anyone have any idea why it might have suddenly increased? Any advice for getting rid of pimples is also appreciated, thank you"
blueballs,"So whenever im with my girlfriend and we are making out and stuff, after i go home i always get blueballs. What can i do to prevent or negate these effects?"
Grades,"I'm a junior and I just got two B's this semester. I had one B last year and now, I'm very worried I won't be able to go to the college my parents want me to go to (which is a very good Stem school and would be the most convenient). I don't really do many extracurriculars so I'm really just banking on my grades and now I'm very anxious."
Bad feeling because I left my friends early on a night out.,"Yesterday I (M/19) went to a dinner location with my friends/coworkers/boss. We ate a delicious Menu and after some glasses of wine and 2 liquor we went to a small place where we ordered a Gin Tonic. Everything was fine till that point. Then 2 other people joined the party, my coworkers knew them very well but I didn’t.
So I was sitting in this bar and all of a sudden my 2 friends left the club to go sit outside, which I totally overlooked. So I was left with the 2 other ones not knowing what to do... At that point I called my brother on the phone out of instinct. I went outside in order to hear what my brother was saying and I told him to get me, and ended the phone call. Then on my way inside I noticed my 2 friends sitting outside next to a fireplace. I approached them and said that I’m going to leave. Then my 2 friends started to down talk me like I’m the worst person of the night. Which I probably was... but this whole ‘let’s party and pretend that everything is fine’ is just not my type. Im not like that.
Anyway, my friends then said ‘You need to come with us, it’s gonna be fun!’ 
And my other friend said that’s really uncool from me to go home. 
I said ‘Please don’t be mad with me, but I’m not the right type for that...’
Thy then continued to try to get me to go with them.
‘You’re part of the Team you can’t just leave us, you gotta do the things you don’t like, maybe you’ll enjoy partying a lot’ they said.
I felt really really really bad from that point because I was leaving. I went inside to get my coat and umbrella, went outside again and said good bye to them and they were just ignoring me. Didn’t even say bye to me. Which did hurt me a lot actually.
After I left the place I felt so bad that I repeatedly hit the my umbrella to my head. 
I just felt soooo bad.

Now, I need your guys opinion on that or some advice on what I should have done..."
A call for help from an emotionally exhausted teenager (pt.42759154),I need some advice on what to do about this boy that I’m still in love with. He confuses the fuck out of me and I don’t know what to do. I’m willing to tell my story if anyone’s willing to help!
I'm having trouble supporting my friends,"A lot of my friends have recently been going to me for emotional help and such. Even if we aren't that close. I'm having trouble supporting them all and it's been making me feel worse and worse. I can't seem to help them all and it makes me feel awful. It's been getting to be very draining and stressful and I don't know what to do. One of my friends recently tried to commit suicide and I don't want to lose any of my friends. How can I comfort them? How can I make sure I have the energy to do so, and effectively?"
Crushing,"Hi, I'm (17 B) and I like a (17 F) . We know each other for some time but only for a few months I got feelings for her. I tried few times to get out with her and I tried telling her my feelings but always she politely declined with all kind of excuses. So I was trying to forget about it and move on, but recently she just kind of get in my group of friends and now we kinda spend some time together and she started to DM me in IG or answer on stories.
I also forgot to tell you that she texts back, (maybe just a bad texter, not really a problem) but I also heard that she liked a guy few weeks ago before starting to text me
What should I forget about it or make a move?
Thanks"

Boyfriend v. Friend issues,"So here’s the thing. At the beginning of knowing my boyfriend i HATED him. Some of my friends were in relations to him despite my hatred. One of these friends, (Kaitlyn) had a HUGE crush on him. So much so, she continually “touched herself” to the thought of him to supposedly “get him of her head”. This occurred last year, My boyfriend and i are amazing together and he even distanced himself away from him after she tried to “cancel” me. By the power of having mutual friends we ourselves are forced to be nice to each other now.  Although this is old news, you can tell shes still has obsessive thoughts about him. Recently this was all brought to my attention and i confronted her telling her i deserved an apology. She of course refused. What can i do? All of my friends love her despite her manipulative ways."

I feel like at one point of my life my parents switched their kids because I was a lot better as a little kid than I am now. Now I’m starting to get more responsibilities but I don’t want it. I think life is pointless I want to die. I don’t have confidence I’ve been going to the gym hoping it’ll help a bit but I want the easy way out. I’m socially awkward now. Idk but I hate my brain. I’ve never fit in anywhere. I’m a loser. I’m not shit. I’m not nerdy and def not popular. I’m in the middle I’m probably the most average guy at everything. I don’t know what to do in life 😕
Edit: shit got so bad I was sent to a psychiatric hospital and haven’t been in school in 2 months I would be a sophomore"
Boys always go for my best friend,"Hi, i’m F15 and my best friend always gets the boys. she doesn’t even try. i just want some advice on what to do? it really lowers my self esteem"
My girlfriend reminds me of my ex and I'm falling for a friend...,"Well this happened in that last few weeks or so. My current girlfriend has started to show the same behavior my ex did (super possessive, trying to guilt trip you, controlling who you can hang out with, saying that she'll kill herself constantly and telling me that as long as I don't leave she'll remain alive) honestly I don't know what to do since I atributed everything to her depression , social anxiety and other mental illness (depression, social anxiety, abandonment issues). But recently I feel as if I've started avoiding her in order to hang out with a friend that I feel that I'm falling for and I think she likes me too. What should I do?"
I need help with this girl I’m taking to,"hi I’m 14 years old and I really like this girl we’ve been talking for about a week or two, I want to ask her to be my girlfriend but can’t seem to find the courage,I feel like if I ask her out and she says no our friendship will be ruined as she’s one of the best people I’ve ever met."

Why do I fuck everything up?,I love my boyfriend but sometimes I feel like I don’t want a relationship. We took a break a while back and I missed him so we got back.

"Weird dilemma about my relative, and how it's causing problems in my life.","I refuse to give specific personal details on this subject (like names, places etc.), but basically I'm in a frustrating dilemma. 

I'm related to a nationwide known politician, who was recently accused of fraudulent money handling, and while there's no hard evidence that shows this (atleast according to the court proceeding), my classmates have started bullying me thinking that I've benefited from corruption. 

What scares me even more is that people think that my accomplishments (ie. high grades, math competition wins etc.) are due to systemic nepotism done by my relative. It seems like it bars me from taking pride in any of my accomplishments.

Even though I try to bring up my case in defense of my relative, they scoff and think that I'm just biased. It's like that one accusation had already made it seem like it happened. 

The thing is, it's like I'm being blamed for something my relative ALLEGEDLY did. And what even scares me the most is if the accusations are true (which is possible but improbable).

So what do I do? How do I deal with this?
PS: I don't live in any western and/or european country."
My ex came back asking to be friends,"I dated my ex for two months and she dumped me, said that wanted to keep me as a friend and I refused and then I blocked her in every social media.

Yesterday (less than a month after the break up) she contacted me again with another number asking again to be friends when I started to move on. 

Now I don't know what does she really wants and I'm still a little mad, because she dumped my ass over a WhatsApp chat. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks for reading and have a nice day."
Help,"So my parents go to church and me and my siblings are always dragged along. The chruchs we go to are always full of people and it's always has been uncomfortable for me. Lately i've been having panic attacks or what seem to be them anyways and whenever i go to my parents about it they just tell to suck it up or that i'm being silly. I dont know what to do about and i dont even know if i should do anything about it. 
How do i even start getting over the panic attacks?"
Not sure how to do this,"So I have this unknown crush at school right. I have told absolutely no one because I just want to keep it to myself. But I’ve been seeing a lot of stuff online about how the only thing guys want is a heartfelt compliment. I really want to say something to him because I genuinely think he’s amazing and want to make his day but I’m afraid that if I do I could come off as weird to him or his friends, all of whom I kinda know and talk to. What do I do and how do I do it? (...please)"
Exclusion from group,"I'm going hiking to earn a DofE award. There are 2 groups. I have already done a practice with one group. Now someone else is doing the award. This means that 1 out of the 5 people in the original group have to leave and join a new one instead.

The reason I don't want to move is because the new person joining is highly irritating. We are all aware of this. The rest of the group are supposedly good friends and don't want to do it without each other.

To give everyone a fair chance there was an 'informal' name out of the hat type-thing to decide originally. It was my name pulled out. As it turns out the teacher wasn't aware of this so he did his own one that pulled out another person's name - Darren. The reason that the rest of my group didn't tell this teacher that it was already sorted was because Darren felt bad for me as an outcast.

So now Darren is supposed to leave but is trying to push me out. His reasoning is strong to be honest. The rest of the group don't want me there and resent me for not moving. Apparently its a '3 man group' out of 4 with me there.

Sorry that was long, I just really would like to know, what would you do if you were in my shoes? Thank you :)"

For those of us that can't donate to team trees,"We all know the problem, you're broke, or your parents are horrible boomers. So ya can't donate to #teamtrees. Fear not! You can still do something for the environment

When you're free from school early and you live in a temperate climate. Just go to the patch of forest on your route and clean that shit up, I just cleared a patch of forest of half my body weight in plastic and old newspapers. It might be a bit of a task but you can't say you didn't do anything.

And if you live in the city, do it the next time you come into the forest"
Need Advice about Love.," 

So, in the winter of 2018 a girl (well call her G) moved to my city and we had a few classes together and since she was different from al the other (mostly Basic) girls i've started liking her. We've started to hang out and i've developed feelings for her, which i've confessed to her this summer but she rejected me. We've agreed to just stay friends, which i've thought we are to this day. Later this year she invited me to have dancing lessons with her and I agreed. But as its usual where I life i've had a Different dancing Partner. On this Saturday we had a Dance ball. My Mom (who is a Psychological Therapist) observed me and had an deep talk with me about love and stuff. Her words were that almost everyone can see, that i am in love with G. I’ve said that were just friends to which she replied, that i've buried and bottled my emotions for her to which i’ve started crying bc it's true and i did everything with her thinking were just friends pushing away feelings and subconsciously still loving her. 

She rejected me once saying that she doesn't want a Bf at the time and now im too afraid to ask her about it (and don't even know how to subtly ask if she has feelings for me). She thinks (afaik) that i'm decent looking and that we fit together perfectly. Heck even if we dance together it looks like we’ve never did something else (which is an big sign in my opinion). My problem is, that my feelings are still buried and I really don't know what to do or how to sort or unbury my feelings. I would say I love G and I can tell that she has a lot of fun with me if we spend time together.I know, that she has a really low self esteem and Likes to play with other’s feelings. 

I'm floating in a big void of questions, so if anyone has tips or advice please share it.

Thanks for reading"

Birthday gift too mature?,"I just turned 18 and got this ring as a gift from a close relative and as much as I love it I’m not quite sure if it’s suitable for my age? I kind of feel it looks a tad bit too mature maybe or a bit too big. I’m also thinking it looks a bit gaudy for my age. Thoughts please? ( Inserted some pics in the link below ) I really love the design and it suits my style I’m just really having reservations about it. Lastly, considering my age I think others might think of it as fake partly due to it’s size when its not. Thanks! Will really appreciate any thoughts and comments!!

i just want a distraction,"hi,,??   
this is my first time asking for advice, its kind of a last resort ditch effort type of thing for me

to put it simply, im not happy. with my life, myself, anything

the days just slip by and they're all the same, parents fight every single fucking day like clockwork, sisters off at boarding school and i have no where to go. nothing to do

atm im homeschooled and have no friends outside of the internet, my closest ""real life"" friend being four hours away (and i can't drive legally)

i think because im alone so much, i obsess over everything concerning me. i'ts been a year, i developed an eating disorder and without help it's not getting any better. my overall view on myself is horrible, i just want - i need something to do to distract me from everything. fucking, anything

my neighborhood is pretty safe, i live in a suburban area w/ a park close by and town within biking distance. but its also winter and cold as balls so the motivation to bulk up in clothes and go out to.. do what??? exactly - i dont know what to do 

fuck i dont even know what im asking for??? suggestions??? ways to get out of the house??? god damn just a fucking hobby maybe jjsfsjgfsngnsgsn"

2. We dont talk

 Like what do i say, or what will he say
Like ""how did you find my insta"" and that kinda embarrassing. And like im afraid he'll see me at school and be like, freakin weirdo

First Kiss,"Okay so i just had my first kiss with my first ever boyfriend. 

Popular media and culture has made me believe that it was gonna be this great magical moment and that im gonna feel amazing. But tbvh, it was just kinda underwhelming. It felt literally like pressing my face up against his face. That was it. No spark, no tingles. 

I do like him very much though. Just to be clear.

Is this normal?"
Am I Allowed to Buy a Nintendo Switch?,"So I’m anticipating a lot of graduation and Christmas money this year since it’s all I asked for.  From parents, relatives, etc.  My parents said I can’t have a nintendo switch several months ago before I turned 18.  I offered to pay for every cent.  I know it’s messed up and I’m honestly out of energy to tell you why my parents are the way they are, maybe I’ll feel like it later if someone asks, but just accept that my parents are crazy and I’m trying to keep the peace.

They got me a Nintendo switch for Christmas last year but I left it on a plane on the way to japan, and since then they’ve changed their minds on video games.  I had a PS4 that they hated me having since I had a FPS (Overwatch, lol) but eventually I caved with stress and pressure and sold it to make them happy even though I loved overwatch and didn’t spend too much time on it. I wanted to use the money to get a switch since the games are more family friendly and we can all enjoy it together, but no. 

So anyway, If I get enough money for Christmas/graduation, can I buy my own Nintendo switch at 18?  Are they allowed to tell me what to do with my money, can they take it away before college or should I get it, keep it at a friend’s house, and pick it up on my way to college?  The trouble is, no matter what I do they’ll have to know I got one, and again, trying to keep the peace.  They WILL ground me, take my phone, keep me from friends, keep me from my car, and even keep me from college, but idk if they’re that serious since they didn’t give a hard “no” earlier today when I asked if I could buy one. how can I persuade them to let me buy. A family friendly game. WITH MY OWN MONEY. AS AN ADULT. 

But if I get it w/o them knowing, can’t just have the money disappear and when my Mom tells me I should get more clothes for college have to come up for a reason why I can’t.  It’s literally the only thing I want, I’m desperate and don’t wanna wait till I get a job in college next year or next summer.  But if I can’t find a solution, I guess I wait?

TL;DR:  Parents won’t let me buy a Nintendo Switch at 18 with my own money and it’s literally all I want. How to convince them?"

Mother is in a “safety bubble” HELP,"I’ll give some context, my father passed away from a hard childhood,  a distant and mentally ill father who never gave him the time of day or the rest of his siblings and he had no real childhood aside from finding any friend and a more self destructive behaviour. To make the long story short my father committed suicide the way he did it was the worst part, the gun cabinet opens the night before a day of work for him and I don’t know why, the next day he doesn’t come home, I don’t think anything of it I just stay quiet as it was late. After another day my mind went to the fucking worst, I couldn’t help but assume something terrible happened. The whole situation was fucked and there was no indication or note or goodbye, nothing to give closure or conclude anything, I went to bed arguing with him earlier, couldn’t even fucking say goodbye, my mom has had it rough for a while but recently in the last year she has taken it out in a “dictator” mindset and couldn’t be wrong or argued with, no rule needs explanation and all her “expectations” are completely fair. Some are completely normal but I had an argument with her and my vehicle being 3 weeks away from completion she forced me out of the house to the fastest apartment I could find and I can’t really work much without a vehicle, I have some anger issues and don’t react too calmly but she’s takes every criticism as “I don’t know anything, I guess I’m terrible, I can’t hear this anymore and walked away, she tends to just leave when it’s hard or true I don’t want to hurt my mom but nothing was stopping her from the unfair treatment of me and my sister and her instant critical tone to every conversation, like she expects me to wake up at the crack of dawn to be criticized, I lost motivation from a few things a while ago and have recovered on a steady rate but this keeps pulling me back to dark emotions, hate, fear, lack of empathy that it’s my mom, as in I can’t take being talked down to, I hear her and my sister having conversations regarding my “completely inappropriate” behaviour but in such a way none of my reason where at all legitimate, this is long but one more example for context, I had a bad fever, told her all day the day before and she still with some tone of i haven’t done shit wakes me up before I even got to pass out, I had so much trouble sleeping and I was 3 days with no sleep and she called my slight raised blood pressure and freak out insane basically, my sister and mom team up and I’m essentially alone in the situation of my vehicle being incomplete I just don’t want to hurt my family relationship by being there, she said she needs space but I can’t lose my mom and am I being cruel? I don’t want to be someone who doesn’t know the context of what they are saying"
I want to talk about bigger topics,"I know there's a small chance this will reach anyone but here it goes. I want to talk about bigger things, but I'm just a teen. Maybe I've been watching to many ted-talks but, as I watch more and more of them I've gotten the urge to speak out about my views on stuff. When I say stuff I want to start conversations about taboo topics. I've tried having discussions about it with friends but they get bored and it's really discouraging. I want to spread awareness for things that not many people are talking about, or they haven't had much recognition when talked about. I want to make my voice heard but I don't know how. 

Tdlr; anyone have any tips to get their voice out there as a teen?"

He doesn't show any signs of being gay/bi. Recently in the past few months, I've started feeling even more attracted to him, and it's not just ""yeah I like him he's cute"" it's a really strong feeling, when I see him I get kinda sad knowing I'm probably never gonna get close to him, and idk what to do, I've thought about telling him how I feel but I can't bring myself to do it, bc idk if that's the right thing to do. I want him to know but I also don't want to risk out friendship. I'm stuck and need help."
My (27F) kid sister (14F) is out of control and my Mother (46F) is doing nothing about it,"So, first and foremost, you need to understand the living situation. My 2 sisters (14F) and (11F) are living with my grandmother (67F), and my mother (46F) is partially living with her bf and my grandmother. Now when I say partially, I mean she spends the days and evenings at work with him (they work together) and then sleeps over at his house. She goes back to my grandmother’s house at about 7am to get my sisters on the bus, and doesn’t leave her boyfriends house at all on the weekends. (This has been going on for 4 years, and yes I know she IS practically living with her bf but she won’t admit it)
So, let’s call my sister M. I’ve gotten to the point where I just don’t know what to do. M is constantly having her gf (13F) over at my grandmother’s and having her spend the night for weeks at a time, even though my grandmother has expressed countless times that she doesn’t want her gf there. (The gf has a habit of being a very negative influence on M and being severely disrespectful as a whole) M is also blatantly smoking weed, stealing my grandmother’s cash and keys out of her purse (she now has to hide any and all valuables in her own home), and verbally abuses and curses at my grandmother whenever she doesn’t get her way. I’ve tried SEVERAL times to get my mother involved and explain the severity of M’s behavior, to which she always reply’s with empty threats and small slaps on the wrist over phone calls, only every so often does she actually make an appearance, and that’s after my grandmother has begged her to come over and deal with M. 
I don’t know why my mother hasn’t moved my sisters out with her to her bf’s, according to her they are very much in love and a marriage proposal and moving in is on the way (she’s been saying that for 2 years) but something always comes up, or it’s poor timing. 
I’ve had serious sit down talks with my grandmother, and she’s at a loss too. I absolutely hate seeing what’s become of my family and I just need advice, ANY advice on why M is acting this way and how I can fix it.

Quick background on myself, I have 3 small boys and honestly I have no desire to move M in with me (it has crossed my mind for my grandmother’s sake) but with the way she’s acting, I can’t and won’t let my children around her or in that environment.
Also, M’s father is not present so there’s no other parental figure to turn to."
My mom doesn’t want me to go into the field of work I’ve been dreaming of doing for years.,"I’m a senior in high school (17f) and my dream job is being and embalmer/ funeral director. I know it’s off-putting and kind of dark but I have a really deep respect for it and it’s the only job I can see myself liking. My mom wants me to go to college, I do too I guess, but more importantly I want to go to mortuary school. I want so badly to go to mortuary school. The high school I go to right now has an internship program and I had one all set up to work with a funeral home! I was going to be allowed to see the bodies and help with simple embalming tasks, I was so excited I couldn’t believe it. My mom came very close to signing the permission slip but decided against it for a few reasons. Embalming fluids (such as formaldehyde) can cause brain cancer after a long exposure, and drug using can be a bit of an issue in the mortuary community due to the numbness the job can make you feel, or not feel. She said she doesn’t want me doing the internship and she said if I want to go to mortuary school it would be disrespectful to her wishes, which I understand, but she knows how much I want to do this and how long I’ve wanted to do this. She also said she wouldn’t help with the cost and if I decided to go, I wouldn’t be allowed to live with her. For a little background, my dad died of brain cancer. Which is one if the reasons this is hitting so hard for her. I don’t know what to do. I really want this internship and I really really want to go to mortuary school. Anyway this was kind of all over the place but I’m just looking for advice, I don’t know exactly how to navigate this situation. I understand her concern and where it’s coming from and I know that I’m not an exception and that I would be at risk too. I’ve never wanted anything more than this, this is my whole future and I don’t want to be stuck with loads of student debt for a degree I don’t care about. Any advice is welcome, thanks for reading all of that if you got this far."

I Don’t Know What To Do,"This might be a little long but I honesty just need to get this out.

So I’m a high school M, and for over a year now I’ve liked this guy, let’s call him Pat. Now, Pat is the first guy I’ve liked seriously, and I didn’t tell anyone about it at first. I’ve never been super private about who I’ve liked with my friends, but something felt different this time. I didn’t talk with him that much, and we didn’t have too many common friends, but even if he paid me a few seconds of attention, let’s just say my day was made. He’s funny and smart and just flat out attractive.

A few weeks into liking him, I found out my (F) friend liked him to. I didn’t know what to think or how to respond to her, so I kept quiet. Turns out Pat liked her too, and a few weeks later they were dating. 

Eventually I told my friends, excluding the one dating Pat, about my feelings for him, and it kindve became a running joke in my group. Over the course of them dating, I came to terms with my feelings. I still liked him, a lot, but I realized that I would never date him, and just wanted him to be happy.

They broke up a few months into the relationship, but it didn’t change the way I felt about him. Throughout the rest of the year, he dated one or two other girls, and my group kindve forgot about my problem. It didn’t really matter, nothing had changed. It was weird because even though I knew we would never be together, I couldn’t move on. I didn’t like anyone else, and I felt strangely fine just liking him without him feeling the same way.

Fast foreword to this year. My feelings remained strong over the summer. I still liked him, but finally things and changed. I was no longer content just liking him. I know he wouldn’t date me, and I just want to move on.

Along with this development, I met another guy. He’s also straight so it doesn’t matter that much, but I guess it’s a sign I’m moving on? But I still feel just as if not more strongly about Pat.

My mom found.. indecent photos on my phone.,"Background: I'm 14 YO, come from an african background. My parents have rules that my peers see as ridiculous - \*\*\*sleeping\*\*\* by 8, which implies bedtime is 7:30 PM, no going out with friends unless one of my parents are there, ZERO PRIVACY for the children(We know all your passwords, we randomly check your texts, you get punished if you lock a door), et cetera. I have a phone, I'm 14 years old, did what any 14 year old male would do with access to such pictures and tickled the pickle. My mom took my phone in the middle of the night, found out, and subsequently flipped out. My parents are heavily religious, although I don't agree with Christianity in the slightest - to me, the whole thing is just an unreliable telling of a fairy tale. If you do anything bad in the 80-ish years you have to live, and despite the monumental evidence telling you god doesn't exist and you believe that he doesn't exist, he will send you to a place of fire and flames and pain and death for the rest of eternity - but he *loves* you.

Please Help,"So, I’m in a unique situation. I’ve been best friends with this one girl for 10+ years and I’ve had a crush on her for that period of time. Well, it’s to the extent where I’m willing to say I’m deeply in love with this girl. And she’s not just my friend she’s my best friend. Even considers herself to be my sister. Well recently we hung out and we play wrestled and cuddled and watched Netflix. And now I think she may like me or I’m very deep in the friendzone. Can someone please give me some advice on what I should do?"
Odd request for advice.,"18 M here. 

I remember this girl from my childhood who i dont kw right now and would like to meet. I wanna try a way to find her and the only info i have is the school we both used to attend. Literally, no names from any other person who used to go there since i moved away after attending for 1 year. Any ideas on how i could find her??"
Help me pls,"
So I guess I’ll just get to the point. There’s this girl that I haven’t known that long but it’s pretty obvious we have a connection, at least from what my friends have told me. So I like her, I don’t know how much yet but I definitely do, and Im pretty sure she has some feelings for me too. But main problem is she’s got a boyfriend, and I’m definitely not the type to be with someone who is cheating to be with me. I’ve had that happen and it basically destroyed any sense of confidence and feelings of worth in me. I haven’t even dated anyone since and it’s been like a year which I guess is pretty stupid but I trusted her so it hurt, any advice my trusted allies on reddit?"
MY PARENTS HATE MY BOYFRIEND,"backstory : 

my friends come over to my house really often and my parents were super nice to them and always invited them over. my family, parents and sister, are really friendly and my friends treat my family like their own and described it as their “ideal family”. i was only friends with 2 of them who were my classmates and they got closer to my sister eventually and hung out often without me since i was out a lot with my exes and was rarely home. one of my friend has a girlfriend and he brought her over to my house often too. then, his girlfriend brought another friend over (currently my bf) and they all hung out at my house with my sister and family. 

when i broke up, i stayed home really often and got closer to my sister and the mutual friends who are at my house a lot and we eventually hung out almost everyday. then things started going downhill. me and the guy who i wasnt really close to started to get closer and eventually had feelings for each other. my parents are okay with us being friends but specifically informed my friend’s gf to keep us apart and only stay as friends. but everyone else, my sister and my friends all shipped us together. we dated and eventually got together and the thing is...

MY PARENTS HATE MY BOYFRIEND!

since i study in a junior college in singapore, and JCs are apparently considered for the “smart ppl” in singapore due to the low scores u have to get for O levels. and my boyfriend, 19, while im 17, doesnt have a good educational status as compared to me. his family is really fucked up too. his parents are divorced, currently lives with his mom, stepdad, biological sister and 2 step sisters. however, his mother does not give him any allowance and does not pay for anything for him and even wants to kick him out. 

my boyfriend is really hardworking, nice and kind. he’s literally an angel sent to me. he works to support himself but its a freelance job and there are often he doesnt earn anything and i’ll have to provide for him. but i dont mind because i know he’s alr doing his best. when he earns, he takes me out to have food and pays, and buys me stuff too. im really grateful but most of the time i ask him to save it up. 

the reason why my parents hate him is because they look down on him. educational status, tattoos, smoke. but i swear on god he’s the sweetest and the most loyal person i’ve ever met. he’s not just a good boyfriend, whenever his friends are in need of help, he helps as much as he can. his friend was kicked out of home and needed a place to rent and was short of money so he lent $200 just to help her out. he puts other before self and i just feel that my parents should not judge someone based on how they are on the outside.

i have tattoos but do not smoke. my sister has tattoos and smokes too. i just dont like it that my boyfriend is being looked down on and HATED by my parents. my mother was diagnosed with depression because of me. she was so against it that she went full on CRAZY whenever my bf and i hang out. i feel so suffocated. i love my boyfriend so much but my parents dont understand that and my mother wants me to get back with my MENTALLY and PHYSICALLY abusive ex just because she thinks he understands me the most and loves me. and he’s also in JC, 19 too and lives in a landed property. i hate that my mother hates my bf and even wants me to get back with my crazy ex that she even became crazy herself!!! 

my bf and i talk abt the future and marriage a lot. and i cant help but overthink about it. although its a long way to go, i just cant help but think what will happen. if my parents hate my bf and his parents are NOT SUPPORTIVE AT ALL, i feel like me and my bf shld just have a wedding with friends and no relatives since friends were the ones who were supporting us all the way and not family. 

help please. what do i do? what is ur experience?"
"People that I see almost every day at school send me this on my YOLO, an anon app connected to Snapchat, and I don’t know what to do.","Hey y’all, I just hope one kind stranger gives some advice because I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. For context I’m a short, average looking (in my opinion) white girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. Classic American I know. I’m not popular by any means in school and I’m pretty sure this is a joke but it’s disgusting and disturbing and I don’t know what to do anymore. So anyway I’ve been getting messages like 

“Wanna masturbate with me” 

“Nice ass”

And

“U thicc, got them curves”

Which the latter(last one) of the two is relatively harmless compared to the first but those are just some of the most recent and I’m lazy. I know I could just delete the app but honestly I get a lot of positive stuff on there and I have a ton of amazing friends that don’t say stuff like that and I would love to be able to block the actual people saying that stuff on my snap but since it’s anonymous I can’t. I know I could block that user on yolo but I’m pretty sure it either “expires” after a while or there are ways around It. Anyway I would love any advice I can get."
My entire life is toxic and I'm not too happy about it.,"So hi, my name is Abby. I'm 16 turning 17 soon and I live with my parents. I'm pansexual. I knew I was pan in about 6th grade and thought I was bi for a long time (First female crush in 3rd grade).  Luckily throughout middle school my friends we're very supporting and nice. 

My parents on the other hand are not. My sister is bisexual (remember this) . My mom was raised Catholic so she's homophobic. Though I can't really blame her, she was practically forced to be. My dad on the other hand, is a known racist atheist. I am also an atheist.  My father and sister the other day had a whole conversation about how pansexuality didn't exist. Bisexuality is binary. Boys and Girls. Trans people is iffy. Pansexuality means that I don't base my attraction on gender identity. 

I'm so afraid of the reaction I'll get if I come out to my family. Afraid to the point where I'm tempted to wait until I move out to come out to them. My parents are also mentally abusive to my sister and I. Telling us both how useless and worthless we are all the time. My sister gets more than me since she's an adult (20) and they can threaten to kick her out on the street. My sister abuses me, but I don't blame her. She's doing a lot for the family and it all goes unnoticed and ignored. So even though we fight and I hate that she does this to me, I know that not all of her aggression is completely towards me. 

Getting past home life, one of my best friends is EXTREMELY homophobic. Even telling me that if I marry a female she won't come to our wedding because ""that's just dumb"".  I once tried to explain what Non binary and gender fluid meant and she again just said ""that's bullshit that makes no sense"" and ""there's only 2 genders. You're either born female or male and that's what you are"" so I can't even get support. To the point where whenever I have a girlfriend and I try to talk about her she fake gags and tells me that it's disgusting. 

How do I get rid of all of this toxicity in my life? Any help?"
I have depression now help me,"Hey everyone,
     
                  So I just got home from school and from a bad day. I have been accused of cheating in a test and that isn’t normal for me. My teacher took a video of me acting funny and suspicious. It wasn’t cheating I swear. Need all the help I can get to cheer up"
Not good friends,"Not sure how to go about this. I have or had some friends but they always picked on me, I guess because I am just overly sensitive. I tell them to stop or I let them know I am not okay with their behaviors, and even when I go away they'll follow me. So I am lost here. What do I do?"
I need help... seriously,Okkkk I need help. As you can tell the title says it all 😂. But seriously I have a guy best friend and I didn’t think I would grow feelings for him... but here we are and I’m seriously in love with him. I am wayy to scared to tell him how I feel. So anyone got any ideas on how to either sneakily tell him I like him or get him to say who he likes. Thanks my fellow friends
Lonely,"(15, bi, female) I haven't dated anyone in over a year and I'm really missing the connection that I had with my last girlfriend. Several months after we broke up she reached out to me and we were like best friends again for a few months, and I fell for her again, but she's just stopped responding to me entirely like a week ago. It's really upsetting because I don't have many friends and it almost feels like she's just dumped me again. In english we had to write free verse poems and I unlocked my mind and wrote about what it feels like to miss her. Idk what to do, I really want a girlfiend but soo shy."

Emergency question!,"Hey there. Throw off for obvious reasons. I have a quick question. My gf has herpes on her lips, it’s second day since it came up. We had sex and we gently kissed on the lips.

Edit: She’s taking antiviral meds as so as she noticed herpes on her lips."
How to keep holding up the world when your arms start to hurt.,"So I like to think I’m a pretty good person. I strive to get better every day, and my conscience naturally gives me hell when I go against it.  One of my top reasons to live is even the people around me, and in my mind I could never do enough to return the favor.

I grew up in my life pretty early, so I’m constantly helping my friends with their teen issues.  If someone falls an inch I crawl from my hole of Coke 0 and anime to give them a stool. 

But... for some reason no matter what I do, my friend group keeps getting more negative. From hating themselves to weight disorders, even that hits me deep. I still jump in, but it sucks watering the fire all by myself. 

It’s not like I don’t get any credit... they cling to me pretty tightly.. but if I walk away for a while then they act like I just stabbed them in the back.

I have some home issues myself that drag me down every day, and it just feels like two black holes fighting over my head. It’s bad for my heart. 

I can’t keep doing this forever, but I also can’t turn my back on anyone. It’s immoral and a jerk move. If I don’t keep talking and talking and talking every day, they start to get worse and worse. What can I do...?"

Ex friend,"There was a girl that I was super close with at the beginning of last year, we had sleepovers at both of our houses multiple times. (we had also been friends in 7th grade but lost touch) I decided to tell her that I was bi, and she completely cut me off and stopped talking our entire lunch table. I hated her for so long. We have floral design together and the teacher assigned us seats next to each other. At first I just stayed silent, but she's been making an effort and I think she wants to be friends again. She's been seeing me do art on my iPad for years so the other day she logged into her account to download procreate for me so I didn't have to pay for it. I do usually give people second chances but never this quick, I don't know how to feel yet, if she's actually been able to change enough for me to let her in again."
My Life is Completely Consumed by School and I Hate It,"Hey. I’m a freshmen in high school, and my life has been really frustrating recently. So, in class, I take all tough classes and I do band. The problem comes with not the classes themselves, but with the homework. It’s taking over my life, and it’s not even been a month. In class, I get stacks of homework. Stacks. But fine, lots of homework is manageable, I can deal with it. But I also have band. Now, our band is super rigorous. We go to after school practice every day for 3 hours - about. And let me tell you, three hours is a lot. But then I have homework to do, my stacks of homework. By the end of the day, it’s 2:00 AM and I’ve finally finished everything I need to do and I can sleep. But... it’s so hard. I can’t do anything other than school. I get ready for school in the morning, I go to school, I do band, I go home and do homework until WELL past 12:00 until he next day.  Even my weekends. My weekends can be just as saturated with homework, AND IT SUCKS. It’s too much for me to handle but it’s too late for me to drop out of band and I’m too scared of loosing opportunities when I’m older by not doing the tough courses. I feel so trapped and angry. It gets so unmotivating and tiring, and I feel so helpless. I don’t know what to do and I don’t know how to cope with this. I need advise."
"Average, millionaire or billionaire?","I've been contemplating which lifestyle I should direct my efforts to achieve. Technically, I have 1 year left before I'm no longer a teen, and feel like I have these 3 future timelines laid ahead of me. Please advise me solely considering the lifestyle to be pursued and not the feasibility of it. 

Average - I wouldn't mind just working part-time jobs at like 7/11, just enough to get myself through everyday. A life where my level of contention is low enough for me to remain thrifty and still make some savings (am not really a materialistic person). A bachelor for life. And basically impacting no one's life. 

Millionaire - work enough through trading forex, stocks and the like coupled with some online businesses, to gain financial freedom and simply carry on with my hobbies and have a family simply to have the means to enjoy life fully. Impact a small amount of people. 

Billionaire - an extension of the millionaire's life, but to use the income gaimed as a capital to start a tech company, or agricultural etc. Probably staying single in the long term. But, i get to impact millions of lives deeply. Quite possibly for the better. 

Yes, I am attributing wealth claimed to lives impacted. To me, that is the significance of accumulation of money. But I remain unsure as to which path to venture on. Please share your insights fellow netizens.

Septum piercing advice needed,I want to get my septum pierced but my parents really don’t like the idea so I am trying to find a way to get one without them knowing.

Why school stresses me out. What to do...?,"Most of the time, students don’t look forward to school starting again. The work, being social, just about all of it. My issue, however, is..surprise surprise.. body image.

I’m unlucky enough to end up at a Catholic school. A private school in which we have to wear uniforms. Green shirt, khaki skirts. 

I’ve dealt with Anorexia and Bulimia for years now, and I’ve just recently gotten comfortable eating solids again. Our uniform is the worst for people like me. I go to therapy, I take medication, but all it helps with is Anxiety.  I’ve gotten more social,more calm,  and my grades are better than ever. 

But I completely fall apart when it comes to body issues. I just tried my uniform on today and I broke down. It made me so sad I got sick and threw up. I might end up not eating anything for days on end once school starts.. 

I’m scared, but my mom is so goddamn stubborn about keeping me in that school.  I know that most of it holds in my thought, but nothing like that has done anything for me in the end. I really, really don’t know what to do."
Be the coolest (the calmest),"Be the coolest (the calmest) person in your family is a sort of a superpower. 
If you live in a family like mine, where you’re the “logician”, and you think you’ve reached a certain point of patience, the highest amongst buddhist monks 😅, than YOU HAVE TO KNOW: YOU ARE THE JOLLY CARD OF YOUR OWN FAMILY. 
So continue to be kind, use your logic, your intelligence, and your calm to stay cool and make cool situations when it occurs, use any and or every tool you have to make this happen. You need it. Your family needs it. 
They have not a rulebook, nor the perfect guide to live the “normal” life, nor they can teach it to you. So be inclusive with them, and to survive, just remember how important is to recognize the parents leadership as a SON! This is very important. 
It’s 10:48 am (CEST) right now,  and there’s a situation really... “interesting” today, nonetheless we’ve got guests tonight, so I have to be cool and make others be cool.

"I’m walking on eggshells, but unhappy with my home life (See text box)","TLDR=Mental state bad, mom’s house=anxiety, dad house=better.   Mom=Scary.  Me=eggshell walking.   Want leave, could end up fucked, Help.


My parents’ divorce has been a pretty dramatic thing, and the tension is still loud and clear. Because of my secluded childhood I am horrible at just talking to people, and with an anxiety disorder on top of that my daily social life is very difficult. My mom, who is very emotional and pretty delusional, has sole custody of me, while my dad has visitation rights. 

So I have two houses in two separate towns. My dad is a really chill and understanding guy, and his girlfriend and my step-siblings have made it a very wonderful place to be.  Whereas in the town my mom lives in, I find myself constantly struggling to get footing, the slightest validation, and dignity. 

Mentally, I’m always the most healthy with my dad. I can’t even remember the last time I stressed out up there. But my Mom has a very over dramatic and horrifying story of what happened back then, and if I say anything about it then she has a lot of trap cards to pull. Everything I do, I have to be careful or else I’m fucked.  If my dad were to try and get custody... my Mom has a story to hold over him. There’s no doubt she’d take him to court or something and get him in trouble. Her version of what happened is very different from what actually happened... we all know that she’d get the upper hand being a woman. 

I’m not even sure if it’s worth mentioning... but I’m growing more and more depressed and I don’t think being here helps my anxiety any. What can I do?"
Please help me,So I’ve liked this girl for a while and she is older then me. I’m a freshmen and she is a junior and we text. I’m scared to ask her out to a date because she is older. Idk if she’ll wanna be with someone younger. I came here to ask if I should shoot my shot or nah.
sibling stress,"I have a younger brother who has trouble controlling his emotions, he has recently been diagnosed with dyspraxia and fine motor skills. Being extremely sensitive this effects me. Whenever I do the smallest thing that doesn’t involve him he starts crying, blames it on me or has a tantrum. He’s only 10. My mum tells me to go away and leave him alone, but when he calls me names and attacks me it’s real difficult to just walk away and let him win. I don’t want him when he’s older to think if he does something he’ll win and get away from it. But him doing all of this makes me stressed and anxious. From this I usually break down and start crying. The other day my mum called me a disappointment which really hit hard. I don’t know what to do and how to deal with when I get stressed, or how to cope with walking away. Any advice or anything please."
Sex talk and stupid decisions,"Re: I'm 15. I recently lost my virginity. It was at a grad party with a girl, that I'm only friends with. We were pretty drunk(I come from Denmark, its pretty normal to drink at this age here), so we just went into a bush and did it, which already is just dumb :(. Problem is everybody saw us getting out of the bush, and now everyone knows something that I resent myself for. The reason I resent myself, is because I always looked down on people who did it at parties, and I always wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about. Another problem is that I found out she kissed like 5 other guys at this party, and I hate myself for losing my v-card to a ""slut"". Everybody's talking now, and I feel like everyone's judging me. I can't stop this resentment of myself no matter what I try. How do I move on and how do I ""damage control""?

Also, everyone I've talked to in person, also thought it was so stupid of me :("
"I [17M] want to reinvest into my life early, where to start/tips?","I’m 17 years old, and over the last 5-6 years of my life, I’ve felt like I’m losing grip on what I know when it comes to how I’m going to live my life. I’m not the same anymore- better in some ways, but for the most part, I feel like I’m not on top of much concerning myself for my age. 

For example, I was supposed to start drivers ed at 14 1/2 y/o. I remember being excited about it yesterday. I remember being excited to get a job, and now I do nothing and am self aware of my own leeching habits of those around me due to their ability to drive, pay for food, etc. I’ve abused it, albeit subconsciously, but nonetheless I have. Another example is that I’ve got a very serious relationship that I’ve had going on a while. When I was younger, a year or so back, I took her on genuinely decent dates to nice places, but my parents paid because I did chores and was young and lucky enough. Now, we just hit our year and a half, and I didn’t even take her to dinner, and barely gave a present for her birthday. 

There are worse things to do, but I’m not proud of who I’ve become and what I’m doing with my life as of this point. I’m not dumb, I know I’m not, because I would’ve been shit out of luck years ago, yet I lack the work ethic or motivation. 

The worst part of it is my health. I’m a pothead, I’ve smoked daily for 3 years straight now, with the obvious breaks sometimes. But it’s bad, and so is my sleep schedule. My physical health was also way better a long time ago, so mentally and physically I’m just not me anymore. It’s not even about looks, it’s about not feeling under the weather or groggy or irritable. 

To everyone reading, it may seem like pandering to compliments or support, but that’s not my goal here. I’m just kind of trying to explain my perspective, so please bear with me if you will. 

Generally, the only things keeping me going are my girlfriend, family, friends and drugs. I don’t have much to say for myself. I haven’t done anything to proud of recently except make it this far.  I suppose I wrote this post because, like I said, I’m not entirely stupid, just kind of lost and don’t know what to do to even get myself the strength to get out of bed anymore. School counselors say I have depression and anxiety, and parents/close friends say I’m always stressed, so I’m clearly not me. 

The point is, I’m lost, and I’m not happy. I know I can be, but I’m not. Not like I was- I remember it. I need help. I could ask a sum of questions but it’d be too long. So, to shorten it: To any adults, or wiser people out there, how do I get back on track? How do I even start? Is there anything I can do get myself back on my feet before I make bigger steps? Is there any habits or small things I can start changing now?

Thanks for reading this far. I probably shared too much but this is pretty anonymous account (I hope). I appreciate any sort of advice I can get, anything you think will help."

Bestfriend Problems; R's Doubts,"I don't think anyone will see this but I'm writing it anyway.
My best friend and I have been friends for awhile now. She's really kind and caring for me. She supports me when I need it which I tend to cause I struggle often with my family. We can all her R.
R is a busy person. They do lots of sports and training that she no longer enjoys but can't get out of. Her mother has her under a similar system of life 360 and put her in therapy after discovering R was self harming. R often jokes about razors and cutting. At the beginning of our friendship she'd get scared I'd stop being her friend and would say things like "" if you'd ever leave I'd start cutting"". That later stopped and things seemed normal. She doesn't tend to have a filter in public. And doesn't enjoy talking about her feelings.
She was recently diagnosed with minor depression.  She told me she doesn't talk to her therapist and doesn't want to. I suggested getting a new therapist but she said no. I suggested talking to the social worker at our school cause R enjoyed their company but she declined once more. It's gotten to the extent where if I suggest talking she refuses and says she'd rather bottle it up than talk about it. Very recently she texted me telling me she wanted to commit suicide and after several attempts of convincing her not to she stopped responding so I texted her mother and told my own. I then called her mother only for R to answer herself with the words ""skeet skeet"". At that moment I was shaking and crying and sweating and hearing her normal humorous voice make a joke I immediately hung up. She then texted me saying her phone died with laughing emojis. I was upset and told her not to joke about it. I then asked if she was serious and she replied with yes. I then told her I would not hesitate to tell an adult if that situation happened again. She then left me on read after saying her phone was gonna die.
I feel like R will not accept help and gets upset if I try to tell someone. To be completely honest for a few other reasons I've recently doubted our friendship. I'm not at all in a good mental state and A knows that. Frankly I don't know what to do. I'm so conflicted with this problem while in the midst of struggling with other problems."
my feelings,"what do you do if you want to be free again with your emotions (i am suffering from depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder that has gotten much better) and u just want to be out of therapy and enjoying life? how do i reach my goal?"
Growing up with a mentally abusive step father,It honestly sucks ass. I have been with mine for 13 years and you wish you could leave but you are a minor. I believe that I have lower self confidence than I could’ve had growing up without a father. At the age of 6 my mom and dad had split up and I’m not really sure why till this day. I’m 17.
Help,"Lads i really need your help!My 13yo best friend is an drug addict she drinks a lot of alchohol,she smokes she is having sex with a lot of guys and it seems she is going to die early.guys help what should i do."
I'm having girl problems,So there's this girl I've known for years but I've just recently started to really like her like in the past few months and I've tried everything to get with her but nothing seems to be working does anyone have a clue what I should do
Why are my interactions like this?,"Its this girl at my school who I thought liked me. She always try to get next to me. But when I ask her to hang out or stuff one on one she always seems to be busy.

 I'm curious because all the females I like do this to me. When I am by myself they love chilling with me but when I try to hang with them they are busy. It frustrates me a lot because it's a waste of time. But I am curious on why does it happen. 

Like I figured they just want to ""be friends"" but if that's the case why do they pretty much abandon me when I try to hang out?

This cycle has been happening since I was in middle school and now I'm going to collage. 

The theories I have on why it happens is because I could just be ""eye candy"" to them because I am a pretty handsome guy as my mom tells me. Lol. But it can't just be that right. Like, I don't think people would interact with me if I were just eye candy. 

Can someone help me figure this out because it's always in the back of my mind."
I’m scared,I stopped smoking wax 10 days ago and I still feel high
"Might be pregnant, might not be?","I’m six days late on my period and sexually active. I have taken three pregnancy tests, of two different brands, and they all have been negative. My diet and amount of exercise is the same, and I’ve never missed a month since Ive started. A few months ago my prozac dosage (antidepressant) was raised to 20mg a day. Any idea on what could be going on? Any advice?:("
"17 yo daughter lost father to heroine OD. Left with one angry kid who hates me and one who doesn’t even understand what’s going on. I can’t even mourn bc I lost my job trying to tend to my oldest’s mental needs and I just can’t see past the bills. So mad at him for doing this to us, to the kids","Was told I should post here too. Sorry if not appropriate forum.  Throwaway account: It’s long.  Im so sorry... A month ago, I lost a lucrative job in nursing. Lucrative For nursing yes - but we still lived paycheck to paycheck and I rent a expensive home that looks dilapidated with an unresponsive landlord and a city that allows it. I’m a nurse by trade. Most hear that and think, oh she’s well to do. I’m a single mom of two kids and student loans out the wazoo. And I only recently began making decent money. Prior to that we barely got by. Prior to losing my job, my biggest issue began with my 17 yo daughter and the passing of her dad. Our son is too young to care, he’s only 4. And dad was minimally involved with him anyhow. He wasn’t much more involved with my daughter either. But that doesn’t matter. He was their father. And he was on a pedestal. No matter how little he did for her or how many times he lied, stood her up, or broke her heart. He had been an opioid addict on and off the last 12 years. We were married but very quickly estranged bc of the drug use. I would not enable him. His family and my own daughter blames me for that now bc “if you had stuck with him love would have gotten him through and he wouldn’t be dead now”, etc. That’s one of the nicer things that’s been said. He went through multiple rehab attempts (20+). The night he passed, he had left rehab after for the first time ever completing the program. He was clean. But we didn’t know this. She didn’t know this. She knew his past behavior. And I never ever spoke an ill word against him. She was old enough to see him for herself. I never had to. I would simply say things like well, he is your father and he does deserve a certain degree of respect and would leave it at that. He reached out to her the night of completing rehab (for his annual bs story in her eyes) by FB messenger saying “hey baby girl, I’m clean again, and I love you. I want to see you.”  She responded (like I believe any child would) angry and not believing what she’s heard and not seen her whole life. She told him exactly this “I don’t believe you one bit. I hate you for what you’ve done to me. A child is supposed to have their father especially a daughter. I needed you and you weren’t there and you never will be. It’s only a matter of time before that needle’s back in your arm and I don’t matter anymore. Like usual. My whole life Shawn. [she never called him dad] You don’t love me. You don’t even love yourself.”  And that was their last exchange. And I tell her time and time again she was and still is entitled to her anger and to feel the way she feels. But it only encourages the guilt. He was found the next morning with a needle in his arm. She blames herself wholeheartedly for his death. She literally feels as though she injected him herself. She’s had MULTIPLE stays at a psychiatric hospital as she’s cutting and using drugs, marijuana, pills, hallucinogens, and I’m sure more that’s just what she’s confessed to or have found. Using in my home. Ruining her future. Smoking cigarettes. Failing her courses. (A previous honor student obtaining college credits with plans to graduate early but that is no longer the case). No longer participating in extracurricular activities she previously adored. Volunteering. Lying. Hanging with the wrong crowd. Cutting school. You name it. Following the loss of her dad, her Grandparents have given her two old first time cars (not at the same time and not same grandparents, were all poor lol) thinking that would help improve her spirits. The first car given her, she totaled on ice and had to be cut out with the jaws of life after hitting a steel pylon. The second, an SUV that she also wrecked but this wasn’t her fault. She was T boned. She feels like she has nothing and everything she gets, people and material things, don’t last. Breaks my heart. I know she’s mad. We’ve seen multiple counselors, therapists, psychiatrists, and psychologists. Weve medicated her with things I’ve never even heard or as a nurse for over a decade. And I will be the first to be against meditating a marrying brain. She’s attempted studies three times now. We’ve gone to teen group loss sessions, but no one understands what she’s going through. We can’t even talk without her screaming at me. 😢 And we still have no diagnosis. I feel this is deeper than the loss of her dad and maybe the stimulus that has exacerbated the mental illness? But without a job and income I can’t afford her meds or multiple appointments. I applied for medical card and was DENIED. I’m at a loss and have fourteen more days of medications (not that they’re helping they much lol) left before all hell breaks loose. 

I’m 34 years old. I’m a nurse. I’ve been a nurse for 12 years. I should have it together better than I do but I don’t. I don’t even own my home. My kids aren’t spoiled. We shop at yard sales and Goodwill or Salvation Army. My lucrative job paid additional toward my $60k student loans. While employed I carried minimal essential coverage which covers none of what she’s going through or needs. The cars had liability only and were complete losses. Her hospital bills, appts, and meds I can’t even fathom into my budget. Even to make payments! Her insurance bills I can’t even come close to paying. I can barely afford our rent and it’s more than that. My credit sucks yet I pay my bills. My student loans are equivalent to my rent. I’m a good nurse, I don’t even play cards!! (Sorry has to break the tension a little lol) I love my patients genuinely and I take care of them as tho they’re my own favorite relative and I expect nothing less from my staff. I had been employed for 12 years at the same facility and upon an ownership change I was let go. Out of the blue. We didn’t even know we were for sale and I was director of nursing. No severance. Nothing. My heart breaks for my kids but I feel so selfish for worrying so much about finances and can’t see past the bulls to mourn the loss with my kids. I literally don’t know what to do. I’ve had several interviews but remain “overqualified” for a nursing position I can obtain quickly. But time is of the essence. My late husband worked under the table when he worked. Otherwise he was a drug dealer. So social security isn’t even an option. I’ve never felt so lost and hopeless before. Any advice that can be give would be much appreciated. Thanks for sticking with my rant. Feels better just to have put it all down and gotten it out. Just need some advice and an ear to bend. Thanks again, Reddit friends.
PS: And why do I feel so jealous that I’ve done it all for them both and she puts him on a pedestal and treats me like crap all the time?!? Am I really that selfish? The way she tells me she hates me I can’t imagine her missing me like she misses him and it makes me mad, sad, jealous, and hurt all at the same time. How can I get over this and get back on top? Or at least week to week?"
I am not allowed to leave the house!,"I need advice because I have no one to turn to. So, I created a reddit! This is my first post so I don’t know if I posted this right but : 

So, I just turned 16. All my life I’ve suffered mental illness and last year was officially diagnosed with psychosis. I’ve had a lot of struggles with my parents especially. Growing up in a physically and mentally abusive household brought out my inherited psychosis. I have only been allowed to leave the house once a week. There is no reason, that’s the way I grew up. I do not get hit at anymore and I’ve had to face Child Protective Services, but I still have the fears that this is all a delusion. My boyfriend of almost two years has helped me throughout everything and has suffered problems himself. This is what leads into my dilemma. My mother and brother have Aspergers and are incredibly intelligent. So, I always get scolded and get compared to my brother and other children. They ask me why I cannot be like them, be mentally stable and smart. By the way, my brother is 19 and we still have to cook for him, wake him up, drive him and let him lay around. I got into an argument with my mother this morning about my grades. Now, I am by no means intelligent. I have a horrendous memory (the doctors say it’s from trauma and PTSD, though my therapist thinks there’s a personality link when I switch) No matter how difficult I try my grades never improve. I have awful self esteem and cry about it often, though their anger toward me only seems to grow. I get help and do all of the work, but I only get punished even more. My doctors have told my parents not to isolate me(as that would make my health worse) but they don’t heed their advice :/ once allowed out once a week, now I am no longer to leave the house unless for school and doctors appointments. I do have some outstanding assignments, but not much at all. I do awful on the tests and it hurts my grade. I have a D-, nearly an E in geometry and is almost the end of the year. I’ve been told I’m not good enough. Not recently, but is what my parents doing reasonable? Am I just not understanding and not doing enough?! Please help me :("
Backstbbers,"I am born with a sickness where my bone marrow doesnt make red blood cell witch means i can not drink or do anything a 13-17 year old person can do (experimenting / i call poisoning) so my freinds drank and decided to do it again but the group got bigger until it is the full class now my problem is that since i cant join them with ""experimenting"" with drugs and alcohol they decided that i should slowly be pushed out of the class there plan worked i have no freinds just a full class of enemies that keep on tormenting me and now i have thoughts of suicide (i came close twice 1st the gun and decided NO 2nd time i held the bullets)

What should i do?"
Best friend is implying I’m to blame for her suicidal thoughts,"I’ve been best friends with this girl for 4 years and it seems every problem I have she has after.  I was suicidal then she was, I had anxiety she had anxiety, I cut she cut....etc. We were always super close but I recently got a boyfriend and started to work which left less time to spend with her. She got admitted to the hospital for suicidal thoughts and when she got back she told me I wasn’t there when she needed me. I obviously feel terrible but I don’t think it’s entirely my fault. How should I respond to that."
Why did no one warn me about the loneliness,"Hi, First time poster here..
So in the UK we leave school at 16 and are forced to go to either college or an apprenticeship, I did ""okay"" in school so I ended up getting an apprenticeship in a warehouse on a 25 year olds wage. Since I started working, living an adults life, bills, rent, care insurance etc; I've felt extremely lonely. I wasn't the most popular kid in school, Wouldn't say badly bullied to the point of depression, but bullied as such, I mainly brushed it off. I left school with a couple friends, now I rarely even see my best friend, he's either with his girlfriend, in college or in bed, I've started smoking the herb to try to see life differently but that's just making it harder to do basic life functions, I'm trying to push my self to go out on walks alone (Not really for my fitness as I work out regularly, but besides the point). Does anyone have any tips on getting over this loneliness? Is it an age thing? Or is it one of those things you never got warned about? Thank you"
My friend has been excluding me. What should I do?,"I don’t want to go into to much detail, but this person has been a pretty good friend for a while and I’ve known them for a long time. But the past couple months, I’ve felt excluded and I do t know what to do.
I’m really hurt, but this probably the first time they’ve done something like this. What do I do?"
Family problems,"Some times I just want to blow up at my family. For some reason they forget every time that the walls in this house are so thin. Or they just have no clue that I can hear them when they want to talk be hide my back. And I’m down with it I really am, I’ve been feeling like they’ve been pushing me away because maybe they given up on me... I was laying in my room getting ready to sleep. when I over hear my mom, dad and my brother start talking about how he was a higher GPA then me. The only reason why he has it higher then my is because he takes classes that are sooo easy that a third grade could do them. “Because he’s special” they say. We when to the doctors he doesn’t have Autism. He above the scale but my parents treat my brother so much like a kid so he acts like one. He will act like a little kid in a teenage body, yet he smart enough to beat R rated games. I guess I don’t get why they Compare him to me. I take classes that are college credit classes, he takes little kid classes. I just don’t see how that is a fair comparison. I work really hard every day even after school to dinner time some nights. While he comes home and plays video games beats them in a week and want to play a new one. Having no homework, no care, no stress, no nothing because everyone else takes care of him... and yet I’m not good enough for my parents to be proud of me like they are with him.

Maybe some could explain this for me it would help a lot."
Theme park date,"me / female 14
him/ male 16 

went to a theme park with a date and a few friends. it was our first time meeting so we took things slow . By the evening we were kissing but i guess just it just wasn’t enough for me . He’d pull away before i was satisfied and after asking him to kiss my neck i wasn’t satisfied. he lives far and i don’t know what to do for him to please me"
Why do this keep happening!?,Long story short I had this crush at school im a senior btw and she kept seeming on and off. Like one month she seems like she likes me another month she seems like she doesn't. Why would this be? But this don't just go for her all my crushs did it.
Advice about parents,"So idk if this is the right place for this, posting from a throwaway account. So my story is I’m a perfect daughter, perfect grades, respectful, all that stuff. But my parents (well really my mom) think everyone on the internet are insane stalkers and I should never talk to anyone on the internet. Well of course they have no clue I have reddit. It’s my small and only rebellion against the rigid rules. If they found out they’d be furious. But anyways here’s where I need the advice. I have a great friend I made here on reddit, we talk everyday and no, he isnt a creepy 40 year old dude in his mom’s basement. We use discord to chat. All we’ve been doing is using the text feature but we both really want to voice chat, but my parents would freak because theyd know he’s not someone from school. He doesn’t know my parents are strict and don’t know about my account, and has been asking to voice chat while I come up with bs excuses because really the only time I’d be able to chat would be if I’m home alone, which isn’t too often. So advice I guess?"
I’m stupid,"I’m a freshman and I told my crush about how my feelings have been on and off with her over the school year. She said she understood and we acted like nothing happened. We are best friends so I told her that I can’t just act like I don’t like her for long. So yesterday she told me that she had mixed feelings over the school year and that she likes me. I got happy so I told me friend about it. In the last class of the day I had asked her out, she rejected me because she said that she doesn’t think she’s ready for another relationship and her past ones stressed her out. Of course I didn’t feel right so I had my friend say that he was the one that typed that when I was in the restroom, he told her that he was just playing and she got pissed. I didn’t feel right with him technically asking her out so I did it again. I asked her out again and she said “can we talk in person”, I agreed and at the end of school I walked with her and asked her what she wanted to talk about. I didn’t tell her about the previous situation . This time she said something about how we couldn’t date because of her parents. I did stuff that her parents didn’t like, which where cussing in text, and saying the n word in text. I tried to say that I could change and stop doing that stuff but other friends kept intervening. For the rest of the day we kept flirting and acting like a couple, like leaning on each other, talking about when we started liking each other. Later that night I felt guilty about not telling her what happens in class, so I texted her two big paragraphs about why I did it. I told her that I didn’t feel right with the fact that we like each other and can’t be a couple, how I wanted to let you know I asked you out and to let her know I did it. The next morning she left me on seen and I’ve been texting her, she won’t reply and now I’m worried she’s not gonna like me anymore and that she won’t forgive me. My question what the hell do I do next?

Also this would’ve been my first gf so that’s why I got all sensitive."
"My friend slipped in an ""me gustas mucho"" (I like you alot) into a convo and idk what to do","As I mentioned a friend if mine slipped in a ""me gustas mucho"" expected I don't speak Spanish and I like him too but I'm in a realationship... idk if it'll last so I don't want to say no but I want a friendship still... what do I do"
HOW DO I FIX MY FRIENDSHIP,my best friend of like 5 years is really mad/upset with me and i don’t know how to fix it because every time it seems like it’s getting better i do one thing that could be tiny but ends up setting us back a whole bunch and i just want to be friends with her again and make her happy. any advice?
Please I need some advice,"Hi reddit,

I am a student from Hong Kong. I am 13 and I am in need for $5000 because I really want to buy a new phone, specifically Huawei Mate 20 Pro, which actually costs $5988 at the moment but I'm sure I'll somehow the price will drop by the time I do have the money. First of all, I cannot sell my old phone because my parents said that it technically is their phone, because they bought it for me, and that they have authority over my phone. And I don't like that. I want a phone that really belongs to me. Secondly, I can't use my pocket money because to my parents it is for our-daughter-but-we-will-make-sure-she-doesn't-use-any-of-it purposes. I can't do something illegal because I am a mere piece of trash, and I don't want my future to be any trashier. I tried earning money online but obviously doing surveys for  Swagbucks can't really help and I cannot apply for any online jobs, or do any stock investments. I made a PayPal account only to find out that it can't help either. I am planning to sell my hair but then I am not Rapunzel so I don't think my hair will cost $5000. I can't mow lawns, or walk the neighbour's dog, and babysit someone's kid, put up a lemonade stand, tutor someone, because, well, it's impossible to see kids doing that in Hong Kong. And I don't even know my neighbours that well. I am a student with poor grades so I can't really help another person with their grades. I might do some music covers and post them on Youtube, add some ads, but then, ads are my pet peeves, I won't do that to others in order to earn money, and most of all, I sound like a frog when I sing. In conclusion, I am a talentless, worthless, and broke student who needs $5000 in 4 months. I can't stand using a phone that doesn't really belong to me. Please give me some ideas on how to earn money, like $5000 in 4 months, please. It's okay if you say something like ""Duh! Kid, you're impossible."" I'm used to it. Please just comment something. Thanks a lot. Have a great day.

From,

Currently failing at life and ready to give up,"I’ve been struggling for the past five years on a chemistry degree and it’s has not been going all too well, granted a lot of terrible events happened that caused a massive decline in my performance over the years but I can’t help but feel it’s my fault.

See, one might ask “why didn’t you just leave after one year” the truth is I couldn’t, this was my passion my dream it was the only subject I thoroughly enjoyed doing and I was determined to prove to everyone that I am as smart as they thought I was, but now it’s nothing but a thorn in my side. Recently read and article that said in summary don’t do what you love but do what you are good at and it makes a lot of sense, I started out doing what I love and then grew to hate it whilst realizing I was never good at it. 

Should I quit or continue pushing for the degree? I’ve already spent five years trying and after the final exam I had today I really sit know anymore."
Am I really not good enough?,"It all started on the 31st of July 2018 when my sister got a job at a really good company. Believe me, I was really happy for her. I always will be, I mean she worked really hard for it and she completely deserves it. But the thing is, my parents were soo happy. My dad even started crying. 
I mean it's okay really, but that got me thinking of how I never gave my parents that sort of happiness. They were constantly talking about how great of a job she has and how it's so prestigious for them. It was sweet at first but after a while it became our every night dinner discussion. And if thing didn't get worse they started bringing me up. How I would have to outshow my sister and get into a good college. After months of hearing these things everyday, I started getting triggered. I would often have panic attacks and even mental breakdowns. I told my parents about this and their reply was that they had every right to have expectations from me.
 This continued till January when I got so depressed that I started cutting myself. I eventually got help from my friend and now I am a lot more stable but I still feel terrified to not be able to live up to their expectations."
I don't know myself,"I'm not sure why I chose this subreddit, except for the fact that I'm a teen but I dont think this is a teen problem. A little background. A while ago I hated myself and doubted I could ever create a decent future for myself. I guess I sort of got depressed. I just either slept a lot or binge watched Bojack Horseman, Daria, and Bob's Burgers. I didn't feel a need to do work outside of school because, what's the point. And afterwards I was sad because I felt as if I had no purpose. I'm kind of better now. I've decided that I don't have to be shitty. And that I can control my future. And I have been trying to avoid self loathing. (This is very recent). I've been trying to get in touch with my hobbies again. Reading, drinking tea, taking pictures, drawing, and possibly writing. But I feel as if I might not like these things anymore. I feel like a completely different person, and I don't like it. I wish I was back to my usual self. But I don't know how to go back. Any advice, preferably from people who have experienced this before? Thanks in advance."
Apartment or Car note?,"Hey, I am turning 18 soon. And I’m lost. I want to get a brand new camaro. ( like really really bad ) but my mom wants me to get an apartment. I get paid $12.25 an hour but only working 19 or less hours a week. I plan on quitting my current job and get a high paying job working FULL TIME. Any advice ?"
Were extracurricular activities a big worry in high school?,"On the start of 9th grade I decided to do art and debate, and quit orchestra. I quit debate right after the first tournament. I'm a sophomore now and I only have art, which I have won some awards for, but because it doesn't have any tournaments like sports or debate, I feel like I'm not achieving anything. I can't go a day without thinking that I'm not good enough and that I shouldn't have quit anything. Other kids have friends from band and dance or whatever sport they play, and I find myself just home drawing and doing schoolwork. I don't know if anyone else thinks this way; did you have regrets/worries about extracurriculars, or am I just being weird?"
How do you cope with the death of a loved one?,"I’m a 20 year old (not a teen but still young) who has never had to deal with the death of a loved one before, but a family members cancer has recently spread and the prognosis isn’t great. I have exams and finals around the corner. I honestly don’t know how to cope. I feel numb inside and don’t want to talk to anyone or do anything. "
Does my tutor like me?,"This guy (my age) has been tutoring me in math for a couple days. He’s really nice and he always helps me to understand the material, no matter how long it takes. Sometimes it feels like he’s flirting with me, but it could just be him trying to help me. What could be some signs that he’s interested? 

- A girl who’s really confused. "
Why does this guy keep asking my mom about me?!?,"Sooo this is gonna sound so weird, but during the summer I was doing this internship program that my mom ran for her company and there were a whole bunch of guys there... obviously... anyway long story short there’s one who I’ve only met once for a brief moment and my mom was right there when we had our brief interaction... I ended up missing one day and this guy was asking my mom all kinds of questions about me.  He ended up calling my moms job and still does to ask about me.  He’s pretty hot but I guess my question is why won’t he just come and talk to me instead of asking my mom questions about me it’s kinda weird"
I’m unhappy with life.,"I don’t know how else to say this but I’m completely unhappy in life. I try literally everything to make myself happy again but I’m seriously not happy. I want to go back to when I was happy. 

I don’t know how to make any more sense of this but I mean I have friends, family, a boyfriend. I’m loved, I live a great life but I’m unhappy. I don’t know why. I have everything I need. 

I seriously have a great life but why do I hate it??? Does this make me a bad person? Like am I being ungrateful? 

I’m angry when there are people around me. I love to be alone. That’s when I can actually get myself to be happy is when there is nobody around me. 

For example this last week I’ve been staying with my dad where he’s working and he’s only around me for like 4 hours of the day. He feels bad for leaving me alone but I absolutely love it. Then my mom brings my siblings down and I instantly start getting extremely snappy. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I love my family I really do but I hate them around me. I hate people in general around me. 

Am I crazy? Does this make me hate life?? What should I do??

I’m sorry about how much I bounce around in this post. I’m just ranting off my thoughts."
I got a crush,"I'm a 13 y/o who has a big crush towards this girl. She's in high honors, and I'm just in honors. We do have the same four classes together (i.e. social studies, math, science and English) I am doing really bad in English, and I really want to stay in classes together with her. I've gave little signs to my friends, hinting how I have a crush on her. 
She also comes up to me sometimes and just says ""Hi"". (She kind of does it in a quiet, awkward Manor somethimes) I kind of get a little bloodrush when she does that, (That probably wasn't the best choice of words to use, but I don't know how I would describe it. I'm also writing this late at night, 10:14 now) All I'm asking for is some advice. (P.S. I have already failed English class so no need in helping me in that)

TL;DR I've had a few other girls also come up to me saying ""Hi""/""By"""
Girlfriend Trouble (Real Advice pls),So I have a gf that I just got and broke up with.  She said she’s taking a break from dating and that she’s not good at it and says sorry to me.

Please respond soon I need help. 
Sorry for the cluster!,"Im trash at flirting. Its uncomfortable for me to flirt because of my past (which is another topic). So when I like a girl a just tell them I like them (sometimes). I admit I don't have friends more of associates. I'm 17 and never had a girlfriend and don't really care for sex that much. Like I'm a virgin so I don't really care for something I haven't have before you know (or maybe im just scared to fuck idk it could be either one). With that being said I do like this girl. She's dope and I want her to my girlfriend. I told my cousins about this and they said ""If I don't want to fuck her or flirt with her what's the point of dating? Why won't I her just make her a close friend."" It got me to think and now I feel like I want her because I see her as and this my be weird but as a ""best friend that's also wifey material"" like I can see myself and her have a family together. Now thinking about this Reddit pr the internet in general is probably the worst place to become vulnerable but whatever. I wrote this poem for her but I didn't give to her because she wasn't there for Valentine's Day and I heard the day after is ""Sidechick Day"" and of course I didn't want her to think she's a side chick. I guess someone saw my drawing though and decided to tell her because she's acting different. I also don't know if she's single or not! My questions are What should I do? What do you think happen? And How do you think I should play this out if I'm going to get a chance to date her?
(They're more like I ask to take her to prom if she's single around the time of prom and she said yes! But like I said before Idk if she's single or not)
(I also want to apologize for this cluster of words my ADD, disorganization, and currently listen to 2009 Drake got me thinking different things all at once)"
Any advice or suggestions welcome,"Okay, i’m a junior attending high school. just for a baseline of this story. i was in orchestra, not the best at what i played, the viola, and not quite passionate about it either. then, i fell into a new friend group and i picked up a snare pad for the first time about a year ago and it opened my eyes to a whole new spectrum of music. drumming. from there, i proceeded to take “ lessons “ with a very good percussionist from my high school and he was able to convince me to join the marching band. i joined the drum line and absolutely loved it, i marched quads, i still had a passion for snare but i grew to love quads. i then started to get into drumming on a drum set and from there it’s grown into a burning passion of mine to drum. my dilemma however, i dropped out of orchestra because it wasn’t quite the musical exposure i needed/wanted. the conductor isn’t the best i’ve seen and the music wasn’t challenging. Alls that i’ve wanted from the very second that i learned of my love and passion for the drums is to be recognized as a drummer, even a percussionist if you will. but, any music director, outside of marching band, refuses to see me as anything but a mediocre violist. What should i do?"
Girlfriend,Can some of you help? My girlfriend is saying all the time that I am trying to hit on her friend (which I am not). She has started so many fights about it that I am tired of it. So can you tell me is she doing some twistd test OR is she serious. And if she is serious can somebody help me to prove that I am not hitting on her friend?
How do I fix a friendship,"So me and my really close friend had a really bad argument and she told me to never talk to her again (basically I pissed her off really bad because it was her birthday soon, not party just birthday, we hadn't made any plans to do anything that day so i made other plans. She got really pissed and when i asked if she wants to do something the next weekend or the weekend after, my treat, she said no. She also had plans to do something on her birthday which fell through.) I was really messed up over this and was in a massive slump for a while. She attempted to call me the week after but the thought of picking up gave me a panic attack so i just let it ring. This happened a couple times after and same deal. I was closer to answering the next couple times but i almost threw up. She texted me seeing if i wanted to try to make it work but for some reason i denied the offer. I feel like shit for doing it and i want to try and sort things out but i suck at argument and sorting out problems and just looking at her contact makes my anxiety go nuts. I would really appreciate any advice of what you would do in this situation. Thx"
Anyone on Reddit know how to respond to emojis?,I don’t know how to respond to them and people keep sending me emojis. 
Friends w benefits,"Ok kinda long but theres a guy who im almost 99% sure would be fwb with me and we matched on tinder and everything and weve talked like twice in our life and hes kinda sorta friends with one of my friends. And he keeps doing weird things around me when hes with his friends that makes me feel like he knows ab my plan to ask him to be fwb bc i told my friend who knows him and she cant keep a secret but whatever. But hes also friends with my ex and his whole friend group and theyre all like gross high school guys who are probably definitely gonna make a big deal about it and i dont want it to be weird i just want smth casual (obviously lmao). So like 

1.) how tf do i ask him ab it? Do i just go for it and ask him or what idek lol and 

2.) do guys talk about like the specifics of fuck buddy stuff with friends? Like if smth weird happens (idek weird stuff happens during sex its normal but whatever) is he gonna go telling ppl? "
To move out or to move out (ADVICE PLS),"I’ve been wanting to move out for a few years now, I just feel like I’m meant for so much bigger- that I can’t achieve living with my parents and little sister who depend solely on me (I feel like I’m exaggerating writing this but it is what it is) I love my parents to bits, honestly. But they took it really hard when I told them tonight

A bit of how it went in the past:
My mother was stuck overseas for a bit right around the time I started Uni and I wanted to move out so I didn’t have to take buses (that varied from 1-1.5 hours to get from A to B) and my dad said it was fine (after a bit of maybes and NEVERRRR) and told me to stay til mum could come back so I could support my little sister who was in grade 5 . 

Long story short, it’s been a year now and they hate it when I bring up moving out.

Present: I told them I wanted to move out tonight, and they totally lost their balls... bringing up how I don’t want to raise my parents now that I’m working now, and how their kids aren’t turning out like the “good” kids they raised and I felt it tug at my heart strings. 

They said all sorts of things from blaming how I hang out with my friends once and want to move out, to how I want to go out (clubbing, be free)  that’s why Iwant to leave and it hurt.

Like whaddafuckkkk

I don’t usually care about this shit, but after my brother knocked up his mrs and moved out, my parents haven’t been the same and my dads in his late sixties so idk if me leaving will trigger his death.. ijdfk yknow?

And I feel super guilty about wanting to move out with a mate before the weekend comes. Because 1) they’re old 2) were poor 3) I’m kinda their breadwinner 4) it’s tradition as an islander 5) fck my life lol

I feel like I’d rather jump off a bridge rn

This feeling is so uncomfortable. Honestly

Help?

What to do?,"So I'm 17 and it's this girl I know age 17, we've been talking for awhile (like 3 years) and I never really notice that she may have like me. Here's a little backstory about me (to skip this just scroll into I put ""The Problem"") so I am a handsome guy and all my life I always had girls come up to me and flirt but since I never really learn or practice social skills I never really knew it was flirting. I had girls and some homosexual guys flirt with me and since I've never pick it up and saw it as ""just socializing"" when it came to actually chasing women or trying to pursue someone I was and still am bad at it. I have everything giving to me based off my looks, but I still have a personality. I like to laugh, talk, and hangout, with people (as long it's not pill popping or smoking). 


*The Problem*, I really like this girl and looking back at are interactions with each other it seem like she like me back. As of this year being a senior in highschool I decided to focus on school because I need to pass ALL my classes if I'm going to graduate (fuck up freshmen and sophomore year). The problem with that is as I'm trying to focus on passing I have seem to not really talk to her at all, like completely cut her off and I do admit that was my fault. Now when I see her it feels like she doesn't like me no more or at the very least do like me but don't show any more signs like she used to. How can I change this because I do like her a lot and I want to be with her, just with school I do need to finish it if I'm going to continue my life and mature."
Stress ticks?,"When I’m stressed I get these constant ticks and I wanted to know if these are normal e.g I smile weirdly , I crack my fingers and knuckles. How do I get rid of it?"
"i’m so tired of my friend, what do i do?","i’ve known this friend for like 5ish years, and she’s seriously starting to annoy me. i don’t know exactly what she did but i’m literally around her 24/7, from being in the same friend group as her to being on the same team as her, there’s literally 1 day out of the week i don’t see her, and i’m so annoyed. i sit with her at lunch with our 2 other friends, i have a class with her almost everyday with one of our other friends, and like i mentioned i’m on the same team as her, and at most i’m with said team 4/7 days of the week. 

like i said i’ve known her for so long but we’re not even that close. i tell her some things, like minor problems in my life but i just feel so uncomfortable telling her anymore than that, and she doesn’t bring them up either. but, since i’m always around her (because i’m not THAT close with my other friends in our friend group/on our team) it’s normal for my other friends to leave me alone with her if that makes sense. i just feel like people associate us with each other in a way, since she’s always around me, and i don’t like that for some reason.

i like my other friends better, i feel so much more comfortable around my other friends than i do around her. yesterday we were at another school for a competition with my team. she accidentally got split from us and i was alone with the other 2 girls and it was so relieving to not be around her and as soon as she came back it was like.....stuffy. 

i guess it’s because i’m around her all the time that i feel this way but i just genuinely don’t want to be around her at all anymore. unfortunately for me, i have another 4 day week with my team, 3 days of school with her, and she basically invited herself over to spend the night at my house this weekend because her family’s gonna be out of town. i would tell my mom or one of my other friends i feel this way but i feel like they’d be so surprised because it’s out of the blue, since i normally act like everything’s ok. however, i sometimes am just a dick to her, not on purpose really it just happens. 

i don’t even know why i’m friends with her? we have the same sense of humor but that’s literally it. we don’t watch any of the same shows, like any of the same music, all we have in common is our friends, our sense of humor (a bit), and being on the same team. that’s it. i have so much more in common with my other friends, but this friend in particular has talked shit about the music/shows my other friends watch/listen to, to me, and i don’t really talk about music or shows i like with her a lot cause it’s just not what we talk about so it kinda made me feel bad in a way. 

i genuinely don’t know what to do, because like i said i like my other friends more but i can’t just randomly cut ties with this friend because everyone around me would think it’s weird. i just hate being around her all the time. i don’t really like being around people in general, i get too overwhelmed. i prefer to be alone most of the time so this is a really unfortunate situation for me to be in. i don’t know what to do at all, and i feel like i can’t talk to anybody about it, what should i do?

also, i would sit with the other girls from our team however, one of them is homeschooled and only comes to the school for practices and such, and one has her own friend group (i’m referring to the two girls i mentioned earlier) and i’m just not close with the other people on my team like that. just those 2. and even then, this friend is also friends with them too since we were all hanging out yesterday at our competition so she’d most likely follow me to sit with them. 

EDIT: also i said earlier it wasn’t anything she did but yeah nvm it is, she always asks me to buy her food and tells me to buy new clothes when for example my shoes are dirty and i guess you could say my family kinda struggles financially? and she comes from a rich family so she obviously doesn’t understand but i feel like by now she should. i tell her no because she’ll stand there saying “buy me _____” like 500 times when i’m standing in the lunch line and she won’t shut up and yeah whatever it is isn’t expensive but she always forces me into buying it for her when it’s her fault she never brings food to school/doesn’t buy lunch for herself. and she makes me feel bad about my clothing and always tells me my food looks gross? idk it’s not that big of a deal but it’s genuinely so annoying. and currently she’s spamming my phone because i won’t answer her texts so....."
ThERE's tHiSSS GuYYY WHooo...,"So in my class, there's this guy, I never tried getting close with ever since he entered school last year. We're the same batch. We  always sit close to each other but the thing is, we never tried getting to know one another and become literal friends. Until, this year started, he suddenly asks me with assignments, flood messages me, always ask things from me, and when I talk to this friend of mine in front of me about stories he enters the conversation all of a sudden, then I, SOMETIMES, CAUGHT HIM LOOKING AT ME!!!!!!! Also, when I'm in a certain place in the classroom, he goes there too! And when he laughs, he looks at me! Pleassseeeee helppp, I don't know what's going on! You think? \[By the way, add the fact, that there's an issue that might make him think that I like HIM!\]"
Step dad issues,My mum and my dad got divorced when I was about six and since then have each found a new wife/husband. I don’t mind my step mum or my dad or mum but my step dad is the worst. We just never see eye to eye. Aswell as that he doesn’t treat me like any of my siblings. It makes me so upset and angry the way that he treats me and I know sometimes I cause the drama by getting angry at him. But he just takes it way to far. I’ll always walk off and apologise later. But every time he yells and yells and swears at me. It makes me feel sick to my stomach. I would never leave to stay and my dads full time but I just don’t know how to cope with him. Anyone have any advice?
