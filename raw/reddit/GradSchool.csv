I [Rant] I want to be completely candid about something I’ve been hesitant to admit to myself,"Edit: Thank you all for commiserating with me, sending me words of encouragement, and just generally engaging in this discussion. I wrote this last night during a mini anxiety attack so my post probably came off as disorganized, whiny, entitled, and perhaps defensive. As I responded to someone below, the whole point of this was to say that I ultimately want to have a career where my work is financially valued more than it is in academia. I want my life to be about passion, and science is something I am truly passionate about. However, I am also of the opinion that at the end of the day a job is a job is a job and we should all demand to be compensated appropriately for our level of education, skill, and experience. 

.


Complete stream of consciousness below and seriously not even worth reading:

.



I love being an academic scientist in the sense that I enjoy doing the research, the hours of reading/learning that goes into it, the discussion, and generally the *idea* of being an academic. But I hate doing the fucking work. I hate it. I don’t want to do it anymore. I hate having to write, the deadlines, having to come home after a full workday and continue working on my couch at 8pm like I’m doing right now editing my prelim exam. I am just not a person who believes that your work should permeate every aspect of your life. I want the work-life balance and I want to get paid well for the work that I do. My (now ex) partner started a job as an assistant professor at a small liberal arts college last May after graduating for $50k a year. Like, wtf. I was earning that much as a research coordinator with a BA before I started my PhD. 

What I want is to work my 40-50 hours, and then go home for the weekend, smoke a bowl, and live my life without having work on my mind all the time. But most of all, I want to get paid more than what I would get paid as a professor. I can’t wait to finish my PhD in two years and dip the fuck out into government or private sector. The idea of having to put so much fucking effort into my career makes me want to vomit. 

I understand this may ruffle some feathers in a sub where a majority of its subscribers are hardworking individuals and high achievers who will probably end up in academia. But I’m done with it and I feel so liberated saying this."
I'm defending my PhD thesis in an hour!,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
(I hope it goes well)


Edit: Thank you everyone! I passed with minor revisions. 😊"
I am just incapable of finding words at this point. < Rant about grandiloquence in the social sciences >,"I don’t know if anyone who studies in social sciences/humanities experiences this but I’m truly getting fed up with my field. Anthropology is really getting to me, my passion for this subject is slowly deteriorating, not that it was necessarily strong to begin with. The overuse of academic jargon is really starting to annoy me. I am completely used to academic jargon at this point so it’s not even that I can’t understand it, but it is so unnecessary half the time and makes it so inaccessible to the average person. My degree is taught in English at a Flemish University and I feel so bad for the Flemish students who have to read this sh* t in their second language. English is my first language and sometimes reading these assignments just confuse the living hell out of me. Why do I need to reference a dictionary for half the words on a page? Why use some of these words in lieu of a simpler one that conveys the exact same meaning? Whenever I try to write any work to be submitted why am I struggling to find words to properly convey my thoughts? Maybe it’s because my mind is filled with all these f***ing niche words that no one outside (or inside) of this field uses or knows what it means. I really feel like my progression is being stunted at this point. This is ridiculous!"
Finally done with PhD,"I am finally done with my PhD after 5 years of whirlwind. I am sharing here because I want to share somewhere and didn’t feel like sharing anywhere in twitter and fuck Facebook. I never thought I would see this day two years ago when I failed my comprehensive exam. But with diligence I am on the other side. So wanted to share some love to all hardworking and struggling graduate students, don’t give up, the feeling after being done is worth the hard work. A lot of love to this subreddit for all the inspiring stories and motivation."
"Going to grad school after ten years, how do I increase my 'studying stamina'?","I'm starting a full-time master's degree (three year programme) in August. I graduated from undergrad more than ten years ago and I've been working since then. I'm wondering if y'all have any advice for how to improve my attention span/stamina for studying and comprehending difficult texts? Also, any W/L balance tips specifically related to missing the ""real world"" of the private sector would also be appreciated!"
PASSED MY THESIS DEFENSE!!!,"I was freaking out last night and this morning, so I took a walk before my meeting on Zoom. It wasn’t as bad as I expected. I’m so happy right now!!!!"
"Haven't touched my masters thesis in 10 months - 40% done, feel like it isn't worth it.","I have autism, I will never be able to hold down a normal job. Doing this will purely be for prestige, I'm having a lot of luck with streaming lately, and might be able to turn that into a full time career (literally just had a sponsored stream that paid more money in 2 hours than I've been able to make in a week). 

I could probably do 4 days streaming, 3 days working but I just don't know. Trying to remember things from 2 years ago/10 months ago/figure where I'm going it seems like such a massive headache. 

Has anyone else been in this position? Is it worth it?"
"Failed a course, PhD program is probably done.","I had a course for which I took an incomplete last semester due to family issues. I had to write a data analysis manuscript and do a presentation. A course I am in this semester uses the paper from that course usually and refines it to prepare it for publication. So basically I was working on the same manuscript for both courses at the same time. I would get feedback at each step and make revisions. 

The professor who originally gave me the incomplete has been rude and less than helpful the whole time. She hates my research area, hates that I am not a slave to research, and is overall a miserable person. She knew that if I received a C or below that I would be dismissed from the PhD program. I was given my last feedback, told to make revisions and submit the final paper. I got it back today with a D. I was also given a D on my oral presentation. The same presentation was given for my other class which I earned a 92% grade. 

I have cried several times now. Talked to my advisor who is going to meet with the professors to see what can be done. But after feeling unsure of my future as a researcher, this just really has me down. I’m good at data collection and research design. I’m great a recruitment and have a good rapport with my research population. Clinically I’m a great nurse, but I feel stifled by academic writing. I hate not being able to have original thoughts or be able to bring my clinic experience into my writing. 

Now I feel like I have wasted two years while putting myself and my family through hell. I was actually looking forward to my dissertation work because it is something I’m passionate about.

But now I’m afraid this has ruined my chances at having any future in academia or even getting into another program. Career wise I’m fine, I’m an employed nurse, I’ll always have a job. But I want to do more for my population and I can’t do that without data and credentials. 

Is there academic life after failing out of PhD program?"
Is a Japanese M.A. valid in USA?,"I have a question about receiving an M.A. and PhD in a University outside the US.

I'm going to Japan next April for my M.A. in Japanese WW2/military history, and will be doing my Phd after. Will my degree be recognized by US universities when I start looking for PhD programs,  and eventually work as a professor.

Thank you for your time."
"""You were my charity case and you still fell short.""","... Is (paraphrased) the last thing one of my professors said to me.  I wanted/needed an A- in his class and he gave me a B+, and that was essentially what he said when I asked politely and nonconfrontationally if he could find it in him to bump my grade, and stated my reasoning.  

I had a really hard time this year.  It's my first year of PhD and I went straight from undergrad.  My program requires a 3.5 GPA to qualify to take the preliminary exam, and because of a difficult adjustment period last semester related largely to my existing mental health issues, ADHD/Autism, I was borderline.  I'm still borderline because my university is allowing students to either take a passing grade (S) or request a letter grade conversion in light of the pandemic and I barely made an A- in my other class.  I had been doing fine this semester until the pandemic hit and what structure I had was just ripped out from under me.

I'm just so sick of feeling like I'm not good enough and needing to exhaust myself constantly bowing and scraping and justifying to get the help and understanding I need, only for it to not even pay off in the end.  I worked so damn hard to get here, and it feels like it could all slip through my fingers at any moment with the slightest misstep.  I feel like I'm constantly letting myself and everyone else down.  Summer started this week and I haven't even managed to get off my ass and do my research."
Does my GPA matter if I’m not planning on getting a PhD?,"I’m proud of my GPA at the moment, but I’m wondering if it’s even worth it? If I’m busting my tail to maintain over a 3.9 GPA and I don’t have a PhD program in my future, what’s the point? I’m not feeling it today and I’d love to hear your thoughts."
A rant and question. Finishing a master's on time before PhD during this pandemic?,"Posting here because I am a current graduate student worried about progressing on time.

I am in a two-year MSc program in biology, having started in Sept. 2019. I want to apply for admission to PhD programs for Sept 2021, but given the COVID-19 pandemic, I am starting to worry that I won't be able to finish on time. My university suspended all lab access in March. 

I went straight from high school, to BSc to MSc without taking a gap year and finishing everything on time. I feel worried that this is the first time that I won't finish on time, and I am wondering if I should even apply to PhD programs, given this uncertainty. Unlike those who are coming from their BSc, whether I graduate depends on finishing experiments and my thesis, not on coursework.

I guess my questions are:

* Is anyone else worried about finishing on time, either for further studies or for a job?
* How to address the very real possibility that if I do get accepted to a PhD program, and I need an extra semester to wrap up my experiments and thesis, how to bring this up to the graduate school/PhD supervisor. I feel like it would look a bit bad on my part. I understand that some schools might not even allow a deferral of admission to another semester."
I finally submitted my first draft of my dissertation!!,"This is huge for me, I have been procrastinating about writing my master's dissertation for the past few weeks and the pandemic lockdown situation was not helping my case either. I was getting stuck in the cycle of wanting to send something perfect because I now have so much time to research and write. This just led to more procrastination and self-criticism of my work. I wasn't moving forward.

But I finally got my act together and compiled whatever I have done till now and sent it to my supervisor for remarks. I really needed a second opinion on what I was doing. I feel really good about sending something, even if it was not my best work. It feels like progress.

I hope everyone on this thread is doing well and doing their best to cope with life. I don't know when I will graduate and what the job market will be after this lol. This dissertation is the only thing going on for me right now."
"[Rant] Not to sound like a jerk, but I’m so sick of students constantly coming to me instead of the professor because I’m a “nice” TA","I really do enjoy teaching and tutoring, and I put a lot of work into teaching my labs/recitations. I’m not too much of a softy, but I am very friendly. Unfortunately, this has resulted in students constantly coming to me to ask for absolutely anything they can think of. Questions about exams, questions about their grade, questions about the technology for inputting their grades, questions about rounding up their grade, questions about getting excused absences for lecture (which I don’t teach), questions about things not even related to the course. No matter how many times I firmly redirect them to the professor, there’s always more.

I have been told so many times by students that they’d rather talk to me because emailing or going to the prof’s office hours is “scary”. The last prof I taught for was one of the nicest people I have ever met, possibly Mormon, and about 5’ tall; HOW IS THAT SCARY? I am happy to clarify anything unclear or help with material, but I feel like I’m getting punished for being a nice and enthusiastic TA by making students practically refuse to talk to the professor. 

Some of y’all undergrads need to grow up and learn that it’s not “scary” to go talk to your own instructor, especially when it has to do with matters I can’t help you with! I have anxiety too, I get it, but c’mon. 

Sigh. Rant over."
Is a three-year gap-between getting a BA and starting a Masters too much?,"I’m considering returning to academia to do a Masters, but I’m concerned three years away may leave me a bit rusty/not up to scratch. Have other people had this length of time out between their undergrad and postgrad studies? If so, how did they find it?"
Should I pause my PhD during the pandemic?,"I know, I know: talk to your department/PI/whatever. I'm in continued discussions with them but want to hear what other people are doing too. 

If you're an international student stuck overseas, or someone who really can't do research from home, which have you picked?

My options are,

**Continuing PhD by distance**

 - I'm a computational astrophysicist without a proper computer, so it's basically like a lab scientist without their lab

 - I can do literature review, but for 12-18 months??? This is a 3-year degree. 

 - Eats into my total funded period, even with a 6-month extension

 - I graduate on time (2023-4)

 - Less competitive at graduation due to time overseas

 - My return date is dictated by when my country's travel ban is lifted, which won't be until 2021. Uni may open before that. (Apparently the requirement to open travel is for countries to have ""zero or near zero cases of COVID-19"", which is just not happening in the UK) 

 - Have to work alone due to time difference. Not even group meetings. 

**Intermit (i.e pause) PhD**

 - No more stress

 - Nothing to occupy my time

 - Funding stops

 - Visa invalid

 - Can't travel back to uni until Oct 2021 (due to housing)

 - Can only intermit for 3 terms (i.e. 6 months) continuously, which is... Oct *2020*"
Academic Probation after 2 Semesters in grad school. Need Help,"A bit of background. I am a Aerospace master student.

I came to US for masters and at first I had good hopes of learning new things. As I got here, everything was different and it took me a lot of time to figure out. Before coming here I spoke to a professor for advising and he agreed. When I got here, he said he cannot take me in his group. I was devastated at first and I approached a different professor. He also said NO. This took a huge toll on my mental health and it affected my grades in first Semester. I was under a lot of stress. Two subjects were basically PhD class with I'm the only Master student. It was really hard to cope up. i ended up with C's.

I got 1.9 in first Semester. I was placed in Academic probation. I had to get my GPA above 3 to avoid probation.

For second Semester, I studied very hard and got 3.7 GPA. Thus my cumulative GPA is 2.8. This is not enough. So in the end of one year, I'm in academic probation and no advisor yet. With the stress I'm going through, I can't think straight.

I cannot drop out otherwise I'll be homeless.

I need some advise on how to deal with this. Thank you

I had very good Undergrad, I have a publication and patent. Now I'm in this situation. How do I fix this. Kindly help"
Considering Grad School in a Different Field,"I am considering getting my Masters in either Psychology or Human Resources so that I can go a bit further in my career. I gained my Bachelors of Business Administration with a concentration in Management in Spring 2017, and have since been working within sales/recruiting. 

I have always had an interest in psychology, and was wondering if i would a.) be able to begin a masters program in psychology with a bachelors degree in business, and b.) what those steps would ultimately look like. I understand that I would most likely need to take the GRE regardless due to my mid 2.5 or so GPA (I actually forget exactly what it was, but I know it was not indicative of what it should have been) so I am considering a Spring/Fall 2021 start. 

Any thoughts/opinions/advice are greatly appreciated!!"
Does anybody here have experience with the Zettelkasten method?,"I found out about Zettelkasten about a week ago. Needless to say, I'm intrigued. It purportedly solves a lot of the biggest problems I've been having with my thesis. Naturally, the /r/Zettelkasten community is all for it. They're extremely friendly, but going there to ask how well it works is a recipe for sample bias.

Instead, I figured I'd ask here since I'm sure that many of you are having a hard time with your theses for the same reasons as me (juggling too much info, slipping into [the collector's fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/), anxiety about missing something critical, and generally overwhelming myself until I'm too anxious to move in any direction).

So, what have your experiences been? Has the Zettelkasten method helped you in grad school, been no more or less helpful than any other way of ""managing your knowledge,"" or have you found it to be more harmful than beneficial?"
GRE prep help?,"What free resources are good to practice for the GRE? I’m a very anxious test taker and a lot of the prep I see is over 2,000 dollars."
A conflict between lab manager and a postdoc? Red flag?,"Hi. Before I joined this lab, I talked to lots of people from the lab, and they are great. A postdoc, however, told me that the lab manager ""is a nice person but he is very bad at explaining the purpose of experiments and tends to get frustrated when people ask him why."" Then after getting into the lab, the lab manager told me that the postdoc I mentioned before ""is a nice person but she isn't scientifically rigorous and leaves a mass when she did a XXX experiment."" Both of them told me not to get very close to each other, so I guess they might have some conflicts under the table. Since I will work with them for a very long time, is this something I should worry about? I mean the lab itself is great and the PI is awesome. As a grad student, I guess I will mainly work with the PI. However, both of them seem to want me to pick a side to stand. Should I ask the PI what happened before between them? Will this conflict influence my grad study a lot in this lab? Thanks!"
Defence in T-6.5 hours!,"Hi guys! 

As the title says, I have my remote defence coming up shortly. I have always semi looked forward to my in person defence since my research allows some fun things to be done. I am in the field of Microbiology, and in all of the talks I’ve given, I play a card game based off my research with the audience, which I can’t do today. I was also planning to bake cookies in the shape of the system I study. These things would have helped calm me down a bit I think, since I am usually a walking bundle of nerves. 

However, one of the small perks of a remote defence is that since my seminar talk is public, I’ve now been able to invite friends from all around the world to join! My supervisor is on sabbatical on a different continent right now and so I always expected him to join online, but now I get to see people I wouldn’t normally, during my defence. 

Wish me luck!"
"I have to cite a term paper with American Mathematical Society style, but Endnote doesn't have this. Is there a way I can get AMS style onto Endnote?","Please help, manually citing dozens of papers would be incredibly time consuming :("
I think I need someone to kick my ass.,"     Well not literally. I just think I need a good kick in the rear so get me motivated. So I am nearing the end of my first year and I have made very little progress. I have some home life issues that have been affecting me but I don’t want to talk about that here, that situation is improving. 

     Now though, I’m at the point where I have no more reasons not to be reading for my masters/dissertation but I continue to just sit on my ass. I have a really clear idea of what I want to study and have a number of specific questions and research ideas, so I don’t have the excuse of just not having a clear direction. My department is great and everyone is friendly and helpful, so can’t say that there is an issue there. I have a good work space, I have good support, I’m not too worried about my finances, I’m not undergoing an identity crisis. I have previous research experience/publications, so I can’t say I am lost in the sense of not having experience to get started. I have, at this point, no good excuses for why I’m not working on my research. If I were describing my behavior from an outside perspective I would say that I’m just sitting around basking in pity and wasting the opportunity that I’ve been given. 

Can somebody please tell me how stupid I’m being and what an incredible regret this is going to be for me if I don’t stop being lazy?"
Evernote vs Notion for Notes,Hi! I just had a quick question about digital note taking strategies. I’ll be starting Grad School in the Fall and I wanted to start working and utilizing one of these systems. Is there any recommendations from the community on using either one of these? Any advice on taking notes for books on digital (I’m usually a pen and paper person!)?
What are some important questions to ask a potential supervisor?,"So I have a research component as part of my Masters course and I’m beginning to reach out to supervisors who have interesting projects on offer. 

I’ve heard a supervisor can make or break your research experience, so what are some essential questions I should be asking when I’m interviewing? It would be a bit difficult right now to get a “feel” of the lab/their group as I can’t physically go see them (given the current state of the world)"
Did I inadvertently anger some PIs?,"So I got accepted to Grad school in chemistry this year. My acceptance came in January, and the school of course had the April 15th deadline for me to send my decision.
When I got the acceptance, I had received an email from a PI whom I had mentioned in my SOP. I really do like his research, and in his email he had mentioned that I would be a fit for his lab. Now, this happened in late Jan. I was still waiting on a few other schools, and so, I replied that I was interested, and that I would contact with more questions 'once my admissions had been processed'. 


Fast forward to now. I accepted the offer in April before the deadline. Due to Covid-related issues, I got busy with my work, and didn't prioritise emailing the PIs in my grad school till today ( session starts in Fall anyways, so I wasn't in a hurry). 
However, now, I'm not getting any reply (including the PI to whom I'd said I'd contact later. )

So, uh, is this normal or not? It has been just one day, so I guess they may have been busy , or did I annoy them by not contacting earlier / ""being more enthusiastic"" ?"
PhD vs Masters in Biostatistics,"Hey guys!

I posted in r/statistics about this earlier, and got some really helpful replies. (Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/gl6dh8/scared_prospective_ms_student/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I’m leaning more towards a PhD program that has comparable classes to an MS, and ideally offers an MS along the way. However, I don’t know ANYTHING about how the competition is for PhD biostatistics programs. 

I’d love any advice anyone has on how to be a competitive applicant, or some insight about what I’m up against. 

Thank you for reading :):)"
Your Experience with a Double Major or Double Degree?,"Hello, I was wondering if anyone here has double majored or pursued two degrees at the same time while in Graduate school?

I'll be honest and let you know that even after researching the difference between double majors vs. double degrees I'm still not 100% sure on how it works.

I'm going for my Master's in Healthcare Administration (MHA) and Master's in Healthcare Informatics (MHI) and was wondering if anyone has done or is currently doing something similar to this? 

What was your majors/degrees? What was your experience? Did you complete both majors/degrees? How difficult was it?"
is it “normal” to stay in classes past your program end/graduation just to complete certificates?,"sorry if the title is confusing. basically I’m a full time policy student in a 2 year program and am allowed 3 electives anywhere at the university, so I’m taking courses that will supplement my concentration in social justice/advocacy (social work, black studies, etc.). I had already sort of intended to get a graduate certificate in black studies simply bc 1. It’s 9 credits and could be done relatively quickly & 2. my undergrad was small and never had anything close to this academic range, so I’m leaping at the chance to finally learn. 

however, I also recently learned that there is a certificate program within *my* school aimed at policy students & training them in fundamental urban planning. this piqued my interest bc I am currently working with a transportation research center that has been known to hire grad students full time if they are good, and most of the students who came before me were on the planning side of things, not policy. I feel it couldn’t hurt to add it to my resume but I also don’t want to look wishy washy and like idk what I should do in life (I don’t fully but I don’t want to *look* like it)"
Graduate Course Prereqs,"I'm an incoming PhD student for fall semester and I'm both confused and more than a little stressed out having looked at the graduate course catalog at my new university.  Out of curiosity, I looked at some of the courses that I'm supposed to be taking in my first year and I don't meet the prerequisites to take them.  It's not that I don't meet the prereqs for the program--I have a full BS in the subject, it's just that I went to a tiny college that didn't even offer the courses in question.  

What happens in a case like this?  Would they even let me take these classes?  This is making my imposter syndrome vibes go through the roof because I feel like when they try to register me for them, I'm terrified that they're going to find out that I'm not good enough to even be there."
Getting a masters degree online and abroad? International,American student here. I have one more year until I complete my bachelor's in information technology at a community college. I'm on the prowl to get my masters but everywhere in my state it's just so expensive. Lowest price was 48k to complete a master's. That's a down payment on a house! I heard studying at a foreign University for your master's is a much cheaper option. I cannot afford to go abroad as I live paycheck to paycheck. Does anyone know any international universities that are less than 15k tuition? For online coursework?
The Teacher has put no work into the class (Macro-economics),"I am in a Masters Economics Program and for the Macro-economic Analysis course the professor has put in 0 effort.

The man literally assigns 300 pages to read per week, he rarely creates notes or slides himself to make the material easy to digest, he literally just assigns the entire reading, this week we were supposed to focus on Minsky the man assigns a boat load of readings:

Mehrling - The Vision of Hyman P. Minsky - 30 pages 

Minsky - John Maynard Keynes ch 4-6 - 61 pages 

Minsky 1992 - Financial Instability Hypothesis -10 pages 

Minsky 1993 - On the Non-Neutrality of Money - 6 pages 

Minsky Stabilizing an Ustable Eocnomy ch 8-9 - 55 pages 

totaling162‬ PAGES!

The assignments are totally left field, he asks questions that he never demonstrates how to do in our weekly zoom meetings and some parts of the question you have to ""guess"" or ""eyeball"" it? WTF? I don't see economists at the FED or Chase eyeballing things. 

His lectures consist of him ranting on and on for hours with no structure. Other courses at least I can say I learnt something but in his class I am just more confused, can't wait to leave this school and pursue my masters else where!"
10 Credit Hours vs 13 Credit Hours,"Hello,

I am starting my masters degree in the fall, and I’ve found myself with a weird (to me) problem. 

As of now, I am taking 10 credit hours in the fall. My PI wants me to take an additional class that is very relevant to the research I will be doing, but may not be greatly relevant to my actual degree. If I were to take this class, I would be at 13 credit hours. 

My questions are:
1. should I take this extra class, even if doesn’t apply to my degree?
2. What is a reasonable class load to have for a first year grad student? 

Lemme know what you think!"
First semester as a TA - I am terrible at it. Rant/Advice needed!,"Hi guys,

This is my first semester in grad school as well as my first time ever teaching. I felt like it was hard enough having to try to teach in person, and now with remote teaching I feel like I am doing an even worse job. So our department has many TAs for the lab we are teaching, and I pretty much have to just base my lab instructions off of what they have already done since I am still new and learning the ropes. 

I feel like I don't belong in grad school. I make stupid mistakes that sometimes my students have to ask me to clarify, my speech gets messed up when I am teaching, the software we use for our labs messes up literally every single class, grading and trying to maintain consistency gives me so much anxiety that I procrastinate on it until the last minute.


That's just the tip of the iceberg. I'm a terrible TA and I honestly don't know where to start in learning how to improve. Since we are near the end of the semester I probably should have improved by now, but I always walk away from a teaching and giving labs like a huge failure. 

Has anyone else felt this way? What did you do to improve? Also, has moving to remote teaching impacted your TA abilities in any way?

Thanks"
How do Theses actually work?,"Right now I am currently a rising senior, but I would love to go into PT in the future, and I have a ton of questions, this being just one of them.

I understand you have an advisor while your doing your thesis. What exactly does he/she do, and are they your PERSONAL advisor, as in they are only advising you and no other students, or do they help multiple students at once?

Also, how do you pick your topic? Surely there cannot be original research every single time. There is only so much research that can be done with the tools we have, and someone, somewhere has probably done it, right?"
What do you do all day?,"I know things change everyday, but if you had to describe your “average day” what would it include? I know this changes depending on lab/speciality, so this is personalized to you, not what you think the average persons day is like"

Historiography... I'm kind of confused.,"Hey, All History Grad students.   
I'm a grad student; I have an assignment I'm not clear on. The prompt is to take a significant event from a year my parents or grandparents were born. Then, explain the events using the same source material, from three different historiographical approaches.   
In class, we discussed Ranke, Foucault, E.P. Thompson, Hume, Marx, and The Annales School. Yet, I'm still kind of stuck. As for the event I'm using, it is when John Glenn orbited the earth in 1962.  I wanted to use Foucault, Thompson, and Ranke. But I'm having some difficulty understanding their work. Thanks in Advance"
Pursuing a MPH,"Hello, I just recently finished my undergrad this past semester and have been heavily debating on pursuing a MPH in the near future. One thing that caught my eye is the MPH with a specialization in health policy and management. Any opinions on this degree? Thanks in advance!"
Finally completed my coursework,"Wow! After five semesters of juggling work and school, waking up early and sleeping late for readings, weekends and holidays writing, and my mind being all over the place, finally, I have completed my coursework.

I am just so elated at the moment, and while I know I still have few more stops with my comprehensive exam and thesis next on the line, I am really just so happy!"
Best self learning sources for academic writing for grad students?,"I have  the ""Academic writing for graduate students"" book by Swales and Feak, And although it's great, I would not consider it a self learning book for grad student, it has a gazillion tasks that requires someone to help you with.

&#x200B;

Any recommendations?"
"To those who used tablets to take down “handwritten notes”, what laptop/tablet did you use and did it help?","Background info: I’m going to grad school this fall to study chemistry. I’m considering getting a tablet or laptop where I can digitally “hand write” my notes (I hope that makes sense). In previous chem classes I used regular paper, however, I’m horrible at being organized. Any info or advice is much appreciated. Thanks!"
I'd like to hear about positive PhD experiences for a change,"I'm heavily considering applying to doctoral programs in the fall, and while I'm serious about it, the fact that I just keep hearing nothing but tales of misery and depression from people I know in real life and on Reddit makes me wonder what's in store for me. On this subreddit especially I've seen a lot of ""I wouldn't do it again if I had the chance"" and regrets over pursuing a PhD

For those of you that went through (or are currently in) a PhD program and enjoyed it, I'd love to hear from you, regardless of your field of study

Edit: For anyone curious, I plan on pursuing a PhD in Organizational/Industrial Psychology"
Thesis Based or Course Based?,This is for an MSEE. My end goal is working in industry.
[ADVICE] What should I expect from an MPH?,"I am starting my MPH with a specialization in Health Policy and Management program this fall. I was wondering on what kind of starting salary, type of jobs (like administration), and opportunities that would open up from completing this program.  Plus, i was wondering people’s opinions on my specialization of choice. Thanks in advance!"
Choice Anxiety: Dual Degree Program,"I'm trying to figure out what to do, so consulting the hive mind.  


I'm starting an MS program in applied anthropology in the Fall. I have an option to enroll in a second degree program from another university partner for a MPH (public health). The options:  


1) enroll and begin dual-degree program concurrently, meaning two bureaucracies, two degrees at the end, but with around a 3 year complete time. This option is known for a lot of confusion/frustration plus a weekly 45 minute commute to another campus, and 12 credit hours per semester, will overlap with about 12 hours of my primary/first degree plan  


2) enroll in an online option that is 'carrousel' - flexible online 8-week courses that can be done part- or full-time, will overlap with 12 hours of degree plan, and must be completed within 6 years.  


I'm leaning towards the second option or none at all. For the second, I could conceivably complete only 4-6 classes and then get a certificate. It could be worth it- or it could make me miserable and throw a wrench in future plans for PhD. I may not stay in-state for 6 more years, either.  


What think ye?  


On a personal note, I work extremely hard, but I know I will be frustrated if the structure of the courses in conjunction prevents me from learning or doing my best work."
Planning my PhD,"Hi folks, I started my Ph.D. in Robotics today, refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gjs062/graduated_my_masters_and_phd_starts_early/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) for context. I am trying to figure out a way to plan out the next 4 years of my Ph.D. with the classes I want to take, my quals, paper publishing milestones, etc. I have seen someone do this with a Gantt chart before. Does anyone else have other ideas, or are Gantt charts the way to go for this? Anyone have any suggestions for templates to go off of? Or things that I should remember to include in the plan?

Thanks in advance!"
Advice on Feeling Inadequate?,"I'm starting my MS in fall and have been trying to learn as much about the current events and goings on of the program as possible - following them on social media, reading the laboratory blogs highlighting student research - and I can't get away from the feeling that my own research, once I start, will never be as good or novel or useful as everyone that I'm reading about. Maybe it's because a lot of them are in the labs that I'll be joining or that I'm worried about starting grad school with covid measures still in place (I suck at online classes).

On top of that I'm going to my MS right after graduating undergrad and I keep being told not to worry that I'm 'just doing an MS' like there's something wrong with not going straight to PhD. I'm genuinely excited for my program and the project I've discussed with my advisors but I just wish I knew how to stop feeling like I'm never going to be enough and that the other students in my lab will look down on me for not being as good as they are."
American vs European PhD research programs,"I'm a PhD chemistry student (just started back in October 2019) and I moved from the US to Czechia for my PhD. Something that I was considering when I made that decision, and which keeps coming to mind now, is the difference in program set-up between PhD study in the US and in Europe. I also had an offer at an American university, and when I thought about that program, I felt confident because I knew exactly how my five years there would look - how many courses I would be taking, what my qualifying exams would entail, etc - whereas here, the PhD system is much more independent. I'll be doing a handful of courses towards the end goal of passing a state exam on 'Inorganic Chemistry' (as broad a topic as that is), and my courses are \*much\* more independent than what I've done in the past. Plus, what with coronavirus and all, exams for this semester have been postponed and I just get more and more nervous about the oral exams I'll be doing for two courses when exams do take place for this term. 

I'm wondering whether anyone else has had a similar experience in transitioning to the European PhD study system, and I'm also looking for advice I suppose, on maintaining my self-motivation to study on my own, and to in fact spend time studying, rather than doing what I would prefer to, which is 40+hrs a week of hands-on lab research. (The last time I did such an independent study course was back in high school when I was 17 and it did \*not\* go well...) Also, any thoughts on oral exams would be greatly appreciated - we never used those back at my university for my BS or MSc."
Feels like I'm drowning and I don't know what to do,"Okay... I've posted here before, it was last semester, and basically I talked about whether or not I wanted to stay in grad school. Well, I'm still here, but having to deal with online school in pandemic has just about obliterated any energy I had for what I'm doing and I'm really at a loss for what to do right now. I'm halfway through my finals week and I'm ashamed to admit I've barely done a single thing in preparation for said finals. I don't even have ""as much"" to do, it seems, in comparison to past years, but I'm still struggling. 

I don't know what to do. The minute I entered grad school I started second guessing my quality of work and the quality of my writing, and it got so bad I felt that I couldn't finish a lot of the coursework simply out of fear. I already have an incomplete from last semester over a paper I felt really passionate about, but for some reason couldn't finish. I thought that new topics this semester would help whip me into shape and get me remotivated, but that hasn't happened. I used to love reading but I feel like my love for reading has died down and I'm struggling to read the texts for my papers. I was doing okay before pandemic, but with all the changes happening and with what's going on, I feel like what I do is not really needed.

I should probably mention that I've still been able to stay in contact with my therapist during isolation. We've worked together for a few years now and they have recently suspected I have CPTSD (not official diagnosis since pandemic and can't see a specialist but still, suspected). I think some of my behaviors / habits around school are stemming from that. Honestly, I've just been prioritizing my mental health throughout all of this but it's come at the cost of my academic career and performance. And now the fact I'm doing so poorly in school is becoming avoidable and I'm mentally about to lose it. I'm not proud of how my first year of grad school went. I honestly want to quit or maybe even defer my next year (which would be my last year of school unless I continued down PhD track, which I feel I don't even deserve anymore).  

I feel like I do need to reconsider why I want(ed) to be in grad school. I also need to get better. But we're in middle of a pandemic and of finals week and I can't help but feel this is a really bad time to bring it up to any of my supervisors or professors. 

I feel like I'm the student who at the end of every semester is like, please give me an extension, I'm so behind, and I feel like a fake. I feel like I always disappoint and I don't know how to discuss this with my department heads without feeling totally pathetic."
Masters in molecular biology or environmental sustainability?,"Hello guys, I am a biology bachelor graduate from a university in the US and I recently applied for a masters in molecular biology and also a masters in environmental sustainability in Germany.

I am very interested in working with environmental sustainability (at least I think so as I haven’t had direct experience working at it yet, but I am passionate about the subject) and love the molecular side of biology, to which I am somewhat more acquainted to as I took classes like microbiology, genetics, advanced cell, cancer and some others. 

Currently I am somewhat undecided into which path I want to follow, so I wanted to ask for some advice or knowledge you can share. If I went for the molecular biology masters, would it be possible for me to link it with environmental work? 
I love conceptual molecular biology but I feel like I would like more a job that doesn’t have me sitting in a lab for hours, maybe something that makes me go into the field or is more dynamic in nature. Do you guys think this is something achievable at some point? (Wether it’s hard or not)

Thanks!! Hope you throw some insight into this very confused guy"
"""Don't just tell me your TA sucked - name them, and tell us how they sucked!""","The professor I've been TA'ing for this quarter said this to our students on the last day of lecture, in front of us. Due to the general incompetence of this professor, the other TA and I have had to put so much work into this one class that we're literally behind on every other responsibility. We asked for help multiple times, and were told that we were just ""doing too much"" or that we ""care too much"" or that we have ""time management problems"". Even taking as many shortcuts as we could, we spent up to 50 hours per week on just work for this course.

&#x200B;

We talked to the department chair about this, and it sounds like action is going to be taken in some form or another. I'm feeling pretty low at the moment. I'm so behind on my research, I feel utterly hopeless. I'm not sure I'm looking for advice, I just wanted somewhere to talk about this. Thanks for reading."
Should I get this this third master degree?,"Hey,

I have a Bsc in communication (not my best decision in life), an Msc in management and an Msc in political science (that I'm finishing now). I'd like to extend and do an MBA in corporate finance because I'd like to work in investment and banking and create my own company eventually, but I'm afraid potential employers will see my three masters as a weird thing. But in the meantime, I don't want to be employed by whole life. I'm 25 and I would finish this MBA when I'd be 27. Also, I believe that this virus crisis has significantly decreased my chances to get a job, so I thought staying at school a bit longer wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm from Belgium so tuition fees here are not a problem.

Any advice?"
I won a teaching award!!,"For the last year or so I've been teaching a physical chemistry discussion section, and I really put my all into it. I care about those kids, and I tried my best to help them, because a lot of them were struggling with the main class because it was hard as hell. I designed worksheets, I met with them outside of class to work through problems one on one, and I really tried to show them that they could do it. 

I guess someone noticed, and I won a teaching award for last year! Ah I'm so happy!!!

Edit: I hope this doesn't come off as braggy, I just don't know where else to share this and I'm bursting with excitement lol"
Do history masters do tests and exams?,"I'm sure it varies from program to program, but I've just been assuming grading was mostly in class discussions of readings and research papers and didnt really know for sure. My undergrad history programs rarely had tests or quizzes but it did happen once in a while, just curious if anyone here has encountered them at the graduate level. I start class in the fall and I'm pumped, even if I do end up having to take a test or two ;)"
Getting into classes outside of your program?,"So I’m interested in some courses but they are not part of my program. I emailed professors about joining and some were “sure thing! Happy to have you!” And others were “no, this course is for those enrolled in the program only!” (But some prof. were the same course and one said yes and one said no).
Is this common? Why are some prof. so smug about letting me in even though they have tons of seats open and classes already started?"
Should I continue with my SV?,"I'm almost done with my MSc (yay!), but I realised something; I actually didn't really like working with my supervisor (SV) much : (

Apparently:

1. **Everything is last minute**; the grad school has set a guideline on the structure of the dissertation (e.g. to pass, the student needs to have X chapters completed e.g. from Introduction to Conclusion). After I submitted my dissertation to the SV for review, the SV said *""i need  chapter Y to be split into 3 chapters instead of just a single chapter "".* It was a total nightmare at the time because for the entire semester, the SV never said anything about splitting chapters! I had 1 week to redo everything - I'm also a part time student working full-time : /
2. **Late feedback**: it took 6 months for one of my papers to get any feedback - literally, out of the blue, totally ... out of nowhere, I got an email from the SV asking me to rewrite parts of the paper that was sent 6 months ago - and asking me to send it for publications.
3. **Superficial feedback:** I feel whatever she's highlighting or wanting to correct was based on just ""glancing"" through or ""skimming"" through the document - not really reading them properly.
4. **Students complaining:** one of my peers is also having the same problems with the SV. The other students did not have any of these problems with their SV.

I was thinking to do a PhD on my MSc topic, and the SV is working on the field - but:

1. I get stressed out each time I do the work thinking what else this SV will just chaotically ask us to do.
2. Messy supervision makes me anxious!

&#x200B;

Am I being stressed out because of this messy supervision, or I'm just stressed out of the MSc, or is this the norm with any SVs?"
Assistantships?,"Hey everyone it’s been a rough summer leading up to my first fall graduate semester at OSU. I was just curious during these times how one lands an assistantship? I would love to do research and get involved, plus get some help financially. Do I reach out to professors? Is there an application? Do I randomly get picked? Thanks!"
Academic anxiety impacting performance,"So I struggle with clinical anxiety and a few other fun diagnoses, but have been very well managed the last couple years with medications and therapy. I’ve worked through a lot of the things that caused me great distress in undergrad, but it all seems to be resurfacing.

This mostly manifests and getting worried about things not being good enough and then the intensity of the feelings making it difficult to focus. This leads to hours of crying and procrastination when the assignments themselves (once I’m calm) don’t take very long or were far less difficult than I had made them out to be.

If anyone has any tips for working through similar feelings, I’d love to hear them. I am actively working on these things with my therapist, but would like some peer recommendations as well."
Master’s programs?,"Hi everyone!

I’m at a loss right now as to what direction I should go in for grad school. I have a BA in Psychology, and considering going into school psychology. But also considering moving away from this field all entirely, as I want to pursue a more lucrative field. So I’m trying to learn more about what’s out there! 

What type of master programs have you found lead to pretty lucrative careers... or masters you just overall happy that you pursued/are pursing?"
For those who are in doctoral programs: was there hesitation/fear or just excitement?,"I'm currently debating a really big decision. Funding only came from my last choice school which is still amazing and I'm incredibly thankful I got any offers at all but instead of feeling excitement (I have that a bit), I feel fear and dread.

The program is the best (I do medieval history) in the state system that I am in. The professor I had a zoom meeting with yesterday seemed nice and I have a friend that goes there for similar interests who seems to tolerate it but says it is a ghost town. This university is in a place that is smaller and more isolated than my current city but is only 2 1/2 hours from where I live now and an easy drive. There is no social life there (not that I'm into partying and am aware I'll be extremely busy but I would like to have options) and the one time I visited it seemed gloomy and meh.

I have been told by every professor and friend that I'm a fucking idiot for questioning this and I need to just go in and do this program even if it is 4-5 years of my life in a place I don't want to live. They keep saying the job market will be shit because of this pandemic so at least this is guaranteed income which will provide enough for rent and food. Many are also saying that grad admissions will be flooded next year so don't bother reapplying. It is now or never.

I hate all of this. I expected to be more excited. Did anyone else face a similar situation? Did anyone regret their decision to move somewhere? Am I crazy? Should I just bite the bullet or get a job and reapply to schools in more desirable destinations next year?

All thoughts and comments are appreciated. Sorry if this was rambling and confusing. I got a lot on my mind."
Anyone here working on Environmental Sustainability and Urbanization?,"Hi, anywhere here working on environmental sustainability in the context of the Global South as part of their PhD research? I am contemplating applying to PhD programmes this fall and looking for programmes that focus on themes of urban metabolism, urbanization and sustainability,  resource loops and circular economy. Would love to hear about your experience at your school.

Thanks!

Private loan lenders for a graduate CERTIFICATE program,"Hi all,

Running into way too many headaches trying to find a private loan that I can take out for my graduate certificate program. I am enrolled in a graduate certificate program at Penn State (6 credits in the summer, 6 credits in the fall) and am having the worst of luck trying to find a private loan company to help pay for it. My credit rating and ability to pay for the loan is not an issue at all. FAFSA won't cover the certificate program. The issue is that very few private lenders will approve of a loan that is non-degree seeking i.e. a certificate. I had no idea this was a barrier to obtain a private loan for my schooling, but I imagine plenty of other certificate seekers have encountered this strange gray area as well.

I was approved for my loan at Sallie Mae, but didn't finalize it because of their repayments options (they were only offering 5 or 6-year repayments plans). Worst case scenario, I will go with their option, but I (and my fiancé) am still paying off our federal and Parent-PLUS loans from our undergrad degrees and I am trying to keep my monthly payments low for this certificate program.

I tried loans through College Ave and New Hampshire Higher Education with no luck. After speaking with people on the phone from those companies who said they DO give loans to non-degree seeking students, I find out via email a week later from the university that it is not the case. Just extremely frustrating. I understand why so many people just give up on the whole ""going to college"" process, because it can be very time-consuming and exhausting just trying to figure out how to pay for it.

Any recommendations for private loan lenders out there for a non-degree seeking program?

Thank you!"
Any tips for taking notes on multiple articles for a paper?,"I’m writing a paper for a class and I have about 20 articles printed out that I need to go through. Does anyone have any tips on how to best gather information? Do you take notes on a separate paper? Highlight the article? Go through the articles as you write the paper? 

I’ve never been great at studying or taking notes. I thought maybe this time I’d try to be a little more organized."
MPH Canadian Graduate Programs,"Hi, does anyone with any experience in applying or doing a graduate program related to public/global health (MPH) in specifically Canada give me any insight into the process. What schools did you look at, what career opportunities did it open for you once completed? I will be graduating from UofT, but I don't think I stand a good chance of getting into their masters programs since my GPA over the last two years is just a B+. Since I'm aware this is not a competitive GPA, is it recommended to look abroad or even the U.S, which I assume means I need to take the GRE? I haven't been able to find much advice on the processes at Canadian schools, so I would appreciate any insight!"
Grad school for Neural network science,"Graduate school for Neural network science


Hey y’all, hope y’all are social distancing and washing your hands,

I am currently a rising senior with completing a degree in Informatics. I am also developing my career and trying to get into neural network science. I have been working in my mentors lab analyzing neural networks from patients since my sophomore year. I have a good amount of python knowledge under my belt, but in my research lab we tend to use Matlab more. I am considering grad school, but I don’t know exactly where I want to land in. Geographically, it doesn’t really matter where I go. I have been living in Indiana for my entire life, so I’m open to new experiences. Additionally, if there is someone who knows of any businesses who would pay for my grad school, I would greatly appreciate it. 

I am also working on publishing my work as we are in the process of writing up the draft for the research I have been working on. Don’t meant to brag but hopefully this will add to my selection of schools some more."
How to make your professors notice/remember you?,"Hi! I hope this is the right place for this question! Next year will be my last one, and I'm trying to get a better relationship with my professors, especially since I've seen so many friends needing recommendations or help from past professors. No matter how I think of it I can't image one of my past professors remembering me, so even less accepting to write something for me. One of my friends even got into a well know program after the list closed because one of her professors vouched for her (she was late because she didn't want to attend, but her recently new job required her to). If I had to do that now I'd be mortified. Whenever I ask her she tells me she doesn't do anything out of the ordinary.

The thing is, I've always been quite shy and I can go a whole semester without talking more than a couple of words with my professors. I never knew it was important, and I always thought that was something that only ""sweet-talkers"" did. Now I know that I've made myself look uninterested. So! Can you please give me tips on how to act on class/talk to professors/what to do so they know that I exist? Thanks!"

PhD stuff didn't pan out this year so I'm reapplying next year but this is so weird. It's done??? What do I do now besides worry about papers and research??

"First Qualifying Exam This Next Week. Nervous, but Might Get Masters!","Good evening, folks!  


This post is a general sharing of goings on, personal progress, but I do have a question which I'll get to - I promise.  


Next Thursday, I'll be doing my first qualifying exam for a Masters degree in English. Entering my Ph.D. program with a Bachelors, this exam will mark the end of my second year, and ten years of education building to being the first person in my family to earn a university degree, let alone professional one. I'm excited, but with everything going, my family is more excited for my nephew ""graduating"" middle school than me getting an MA, which hurts, to be honest.  


Getting to the questions:

* Did you feel any different getting your Masters and being in seminar, discussions?
* For those of with your Masters, do you identify as a professor, or still an instructor? I know some professors, faculty argue you can only be a professor with a Ph.D., so just curious how you handle it, or if it's an issue for any of you at all.  


Stay safe, stay healthy, and as I say to my students: stay off the damn beaches!"
Looking for Advisor for a first year CS PhD student,"So, I've accepted an offer from a university to do my PhD. I have full financial support for my first year (fall, winter, summer). I'm not too picky in terms of research project, as long as it is still in my general area (systems). But I have several PIs that I'd love to work with.

What is the best way to reach out to my potential advisors? Could I tell them that I am interested to work with them, even before the semester start?

I’ve worked in labs all throughout undergrad and worked field jobs during the summer. Currently waiting for my next field position to start actually. I didn’t stick with one lab and I never had anything published, I just enjoyed doing the field and lab work. I just don’t think the research side of this field is right for me, and I kinda wish I realized that sooner. Currently looking at other fields that interest me and trying to learn as much as I can about them so I can hopefully make a better choice this time around."
Behavior of many PIs has been outrageous during COVID-19 outbreak,"I am a PhD student in one of the most prestigious institute in India. The response of many Professors towards their Masters' dissertees and PhD students has been appalling to the point of sickening. Same  reaction has been noted by my and my friends' acquaintances in other institutes. 

Covid-19 epidemic was late to come in India, but it has created an environment full of anxiousness, fear, and melancholy. We are still undergoing stage 2 of the epidemic, and the next 2-3 weeks are deemed to be critical because we can either enter higher stage, where there's a risk of complete shutdown and being away from loved ones for a very long time. Like other parts of the world grad school here is already too tough, work pressure sucks all the life out of you. Comes global pandemic, uncertainty of the outbreak period broke even the strongest among us. Understandably many of us wanted to go home and spend the period of outbreak with our families. But even during this time of duress, PIs are forcing us to work in labs while diplomatically saying that you are free to go home. Many students have suspended their plans to head home because they fear retribution by their respective supervisors once the situation returns to normalcy. Even the director of the institute has refused to take clear-cut stand.

The academia world seems cold and heartless. This incident has made me question whether I really want to be part of such a world. Even the students who have stayed feel miserable and apprehensive about the immediate future."
Will I be in trouble for allowing my students to submit assignments after the deadlines have passed?,"I am a graduate teaching assistant. Ever since the classes transitioned to online system, some of my students who used to submit assignments regularly and within deadlines have stopped doing so. Next week is the last week of classes, and I was thinking of sending an email to my class informing that I will accept any assignment submissions if a student has missed one. I decided not to reach out to student on a personal basis because it might make them uncomfortable in case they were not submitting homework on purpose. The pandemic has impacted our lives in unexpected ways, and there is just no way to gauge the extent of collateral damage here. I thought that some leniency will definitely help my students.

But, is it within my rights to do so? At this point, I don’t even care about any rules that normally prohibit accepting late submissions cause such rules were not made taking situations like these into account. I would love to hear your opinion on this matter."
Question about conferences and such,"Hello, I'm currently finishing up my first year of graduate school and I'm working with a professor to submit some abstracts to conferences.

I'm in an interdiscplinary MA program focusing on communication.  Most of my graduate research is on cross-cultural comparison of media, social/new media, technology, etc. and my undergrad background is in History, so I think I would do better submitting to conferences related to those fields.

So far I've identified the MLA conferences: SAMLA, NEMLA, etc.  and have been looking out for CFPs for others.

My question is how do I know what makes a 'good' conference or one worth submitting to?  The MLA conferences seem like a good start, but I have no frame of reference since I've been out of school for a few years.

My advisor is somewhat helpful, but they are also fairly busy so I haven't been able to get a good answer on this question.

It would be good to get some conference experience on my CV.  I just want to make sure its legit.

Thanks for any advice!"
Best way to study for MA English Lit. comprehensive exam?,Hi r/GradSchool. I’ll be taking my MA comps for English Lit in Spring 2021. Is there a best way that anyone here has found for studying for a test like this? Any recommended anthologies? Strategies? Anything is helpful - thank you!
Double Major?,"I’m considering adding a second masters degree to my course of study. I’m currently in a masters program for clinical mental health counseling, but my school offers a dual degree program where I could graduate with a second masters in marriage and family counseling. It would add a second internship as well as additional courses to my course of study. Has anyone done this?

Convince me NOT to pursue a MS/PhD in the Arts...,"Considering pursuing graduate education in the Arts/humanities because I flat out love the reading and research. Helping others research their projects, doing my own, and teaching classes... I'd be enthralled in doing so!

By arts I'm referring to Psychology, English, and History. These are the areas I'm most interested."
I am utterly intimidated by my supervisor and can't function after a meeting with him,"I'm weeks away from submitting my final PhD thesis. I (30F) have been under his supervision for about 5 years now, but I am still so intimidated by him. I am generally not a shy or underconfident person, but whenevr I walk into a meeting with him, I am panicked. If he asks me a question, I can hardly answer it. I freeze because I feel like I can never get it right. The tiny gaps in my knowledge convert to vast crevices in my head. I feel completely powerless since he always controls the tone of our conversation. I never feel like this with anyone else. 
I understand that academia is about being challenged and criticised but how do you deal with criticism? It's hard for me to not think less of myself. And I hate that feeling worthless. The standards are too high and it's killing my self esteem. 
I need some advice on how to navigate the final few weeks of my PhD."
What should I expect from my committee members?,"Hi ya'll, 

I am a first year PhD student and am starting to put together my committee. I am also doing a minor which means one of the members of my committee must be faculty in the department my minor is in. I emailed someone last week and she asked me many more questions than I had anticipated and still hasn't said yes. She also ended up wanting to schedule a phone call to discuss my career goals, my expectations of my committee members, and so I can ask her questions as well. 

I suppose this is all reasonable but my question is what are reasonable things to say you expect of your committee members? Other than showing up to meetings, providing general guidance on courses to take or conferences to attend, and being a critical but reasonable voice towards the development of my dissertation I am at a loss as to what I should expect from them? 

Does anyone have any advice? It's really causing me a lot of anxiety....."
How does it work when you retake pre-reqs?,"In a few years I plan on going to PT school but I still have to take some chems and physics because my undergrad major didn’t require those classes. There’s also some classes that I took in my undergrad that I got C’s (and 1 D in) and I’ve been thinking about retaking those as well depending on how important they are for PT school. None of them are really science/math based classes so that’s good but my dumbass did get a D in psych bc I took it in my early years where I just wasn’t giving a shit about school. So  let’s say I retake psych and got an A, would my D be replaced by the A or would the average be taken of the two? How does it work? Or does it vary between school?

Thanks for the help!"
"I want to get a PhD in epidemiology, but I'm not sure if it will be enough.","I want to do my PhD in epidemiology after my MPH in epidemiology, but I'm coming from a background in biochemistry so when I look at epidemiological research I feel like I'm missing the wet lab/molecular biology/chemistry component.

I love, love, love doing research. I enjoyed it as an undergraduate student so I know that a PhD is what I want. But I want to be in the field of public health which isn't really a hardcore science field. So I'm trying to find a bridge.

I love epidemiology, don't get me wrong, but how can I bring my undergrad in biochemistry and my MPH in epidemiology together in my PhD?

P.S. I haven't started my MPH yet. I got the information about epidemiology research from looking up what it means in journals, reading research papers, and looking at the websites of potential PhD schools for the list of expected competencies."

Advice for writing research papers,"TDLR: I often write my papers in a cram state and feel guilty about it despite receiving high praise. Im asking about systems or methods you all employ to take good notes/citations so I can avoid spending up to 8 hours skimming books for citations as I write the paper. 

I am currently finishing my first year of history program (M.A.) and am interested to hear how some of you keep track of your notes/research before you write your papers.

If I’m being honest, I’ve always just complied a list of sources ahead of time and leave it until a week or two before it’s due and go into a mad dash to burn through all the texts. 

Honestly, I feel dirty doing this and feel I could produce better work (my professors say they are impressed with my work despite the fact much of it is rushed) but the issue is I often work best when I wait until the last week or so.

I think this is because I really don’t have any good systems in place to retain notes on books and authors beyond when they sit within my memory.

What I typically do now is start skimming books a week or two prior to the due date of my paper. This gives me a general idea of which of the sources I’ve collected that will be most useful. Then a night or two before it’s due I’ll sit down to actually write the paper. I’m well versed in background knowledge in my field so it’s never an issue for me to pump out an introduction to the paper but then when I get to the body, largely because I don’t have a good note taking system, I skim through books again to identify sources  to cite and this can end up taking anywhere between 4-8 hours if the paper is longer than 15 pages (most of my papers are between 20-30 pages each). 

I guess I’m just asking how do you write your papers? Do you have any systems that work well for you in terms of note taking or better retaining arguments from books?"
I can’t do it.,"I’m in the process of writing my proposal. For the past 3 months I have been struggling with it to a point that I am thinking of dropping out but I’m almost done with all my classes and internships so dropping out just doesn’t feel right. However, I know I can only graduate when I submit my thesis. 
I have never struggled this hard to write a paper, in fact I have written a dissertation for my masters which also got published in an international journal. The process then felt like a cake walk. Now I’m struggling so hard with academic writing, with the political sensitivity of the topic, and now this whole pandemic. I feel stuck mentally and spiritually. But then again there is this inner belief that tells me I can do it. I don’t know how get out of this rut and start my creative process again. I am thinking of psychedelics to expand my creative process. Please help"
Is it reasonable to apply to a Ph.D. program in business right after graduating with a master's degree?,"Not sure if this is the best sub to post this in, please let me know if this question would better fit elsewhere.

I'm in a master's program now for an MBA. It was recently recommended to me that I look into furthering my education with a Ph.D. so that I could ""have my pick of jobs.""

I was just wondering if anyone here has gone on to get a Ph.D. (specifically in business) before actually working for larger companies? I always thought the typical process was to get a job first to gain ""experience"" and later on get a Ph.D. once you have more on your resume.

Let me know your thoughts, anything is appreciated and other disciplines please give me your input! Thanks so much."
Grad school options after liberal arts,"I may study an undergrad course in liberal arts, where I major in economics and minor in politics. What could my options be for higher studies after this course?"
Regarding the Santa Cruz Grading Strike,"Please to not be fooled by them.  California is expensive but we all ""suffer"" the same, including the undergrads that these graduate students were supposed to serve.  Being a graduate teaching assistant is basically a training job, and when we elect to attend graduate school it is generally accepted that you will need to live very frugally, and possibly take out loans.  It's a period of optional economic disadvantage in the hopes that when it's done we will be at an advantage with our PhDs and all.  The people complaining about ""90% rent burden"" are sometimes unfortunate cases where it's all they could find, but more frequently it is people who choose to live alone.  I've lived 3 different places in Santa cruz, and the first one put me at ""70% rent burden"" so you know what I did?  I took out a 20k loan.  My peers should be ashamed of themselves. I am ashamed of being a UCSC grad myself right now. Their tactics are unfair, they got a win, considered it a loss, and then willingly and knowingly chose to be fired so they could look like martyrs. Now they are asking to be reinstated. Ri-freaking-diculous.  Also, so everyone knows, they chose to block the metro buses onto campus today, like every day in the last 4 weeks, but that meant that they prevented a ton of people from voting, which is likely considering that the apathy threshold the public has toward voting at all is fairly low.  But here are the facts:

To the general public:

1). We take home $2,100 cash after taxes for a maximum of 20 hr work weeks (and the chancellor just offered 5 yrs guaranteed funding and 2.5k/yr housing supplement)

2) They are asking for an additional $1,400 gross income

3) We receive tuition remission

4) We receive excellent health care

5) We have access to emergency funds via slug support

6) We have access to free food pantries once a week which I myself have used (boohoo?)

7) We are all eligible as grads for $20k/yr in loans, which you would presumably take out if, I don't know, your circumstances were dire, or like, you had a kid

These are amazing benefits for a ***graduate student***. I am grateful AF to my school because I feel like they've taken pretty damn good care of me considering how much I've been through since starting grad school.  Don't buy their propaganda, please.  It upsets me to see this small minority of enraged, mob mentality, high horse BS when the school has done so much to try and help its grads.  Don't get me wrong, they are part of the problem, but they were made aware during week 1, and immediately offered the 2.5k and 5 yrs funding.  It's being addressed, and that was made clear before those people CHOSE to get fired."
"Lifetime goal of earning a PhD, but I'm restricted a bit...","I'm wanting to earn a Ph.D in the many years to come. What I'm battling with is, I'm restricted into only being able to do so online(gotta work to pay for it all). I've done a decent amount of research and have concluded that UK universities are probably my best bet. Not only do they offer shorter programs, but they treat education as such and not a business like in the US. I digress.

When looking around, I've noticed the MSC in psychology are vastly conversion courses, for people who want to be a psychologist and do not have a relevant bachelor's degree. My Bsc is relevant, however, online only PhD programs require a Ma/MSC. 

Is it best for me to stop searching for a Bsc-> PhD online program in psychology and accept the PhD route? Or are there universities that I have missed in my search?

(Notes: yes I know in person is better and I would do so if it was available to me. I have 0 financial aid options, and have to pay 100% out of pocket. To which I must work full time and study part time. No I dont want to complete my PhD in 3 years, that's nearly impossible for my situation. I know it will take 5-8years of PT studying.)"

Group project...,"So I’m almost finished with my second semester of grad school! I have three things left, one for each class. I have an acquaintance in two of my three classes and I know she is having a hard time keeping up. I have been helping her out with a few assignments that we have had thus far. Really just making sure she understands the concepts, and is able to get everything done. Well, she and I, along with two other people have been assigned to the same group for a final project. The project is truly a gift from the professor. He has assigned each group several of the review questions from the qualifying exam review for the subject. His plan is to check all the answers for accuracy and then compile all the answers for the class. Additionally, this project replaces our final exam. Another group member and I are planning to make sure we have answers for all the questions just in case our other two members flake. 

My question is if the others don’t participate, should we let them coast on our work or throw the under the bus. As part of the assignment we are asked to talk about everyone’s contribution."
Would you take a fully funded MA at the well known Buddhist studies field at FSU or unfunded at Yale and Oxford?,"As I tried to make clear in the title, FSU was recommended by my Yale and Duke contacts. The plan is to get an MA and then move on to a PhD.

Really struggling to read papers!,"I'm currently studying for a master's in philosophy. My programme is research-based, so I'm expected to read a large number of papers. However, I'm really struggling. I started the degree back in October, and I've done a fraction of the reading I should have done by this point in the year. I find it exceptionally difficult to focus for longer than a couple of minutes - after that, my reading comprehension dwindles to next to nothing. I struggle to get through a paper a day. I was an avid reader in the past, but my ability to read even the literature I used to devour has decreased significantly. I also struggle to effectively summarise the papers I read. What can I do to overcome this?"
Do you think it would be possible to fix what might be a mistake on my BS's transcript?,"So I think there may be a mistake on my transcript. In sum, I retook two classes that I got fairly low grades on - one not passing the other barely passing. I got better grades. All this time I thought the I next to my grades meant something else, but it means Included in gpa. So it turns out they included both my old grades and the new grades I got from retaking it are included. I figure it must be a mistake because all the other classes I retook doesn't show that problem.

Thing is, it is a whole year past graduation. ( I had a really terrible advisor - she wasn't even supposed to be one - and to be honest, I had a terrible time in college so when I graduated I tried to put it all behind me for a gap year.) Administration is absolute crap there. It would be over a .03 difference, so I wonder if it's worth it, but I am trying to get into a competitive program with a low gpa I am working on improving, so maybe it is? Or maybe I'm wrong you think? Ughhh I hate the idea of talking to these people again."
twiddling my thumbs,"Hey r/GradSchool. All the defense posts have been great to see lately. I wish I had one of my own to share. Instead, I'm sitting here waiting to see what my committee chair has to say about my data and conclusions chapters. Waiting for feedback has repeatedly been the most agonizing part of the past year-plus; my chair takes forever to get anything back. I realized too late the entire process would consist of handing him a chapter, hearing nothing for weeks, only to follow-up to get a few comments and then send an updated draft to the rest of the committee to get truly reviewed. I'm trying not to get too impatient right now, everyone's dealing with their own shit. But he's been close to the most worthless chair ever, if you know a good way to passive aggressively call this out in an acknowledgements section add it in the comments.  

This time I thought I'd head off the process a little by sending the whole committee my last two chapters at once. So now instead of just me waiting to hear feedback everyone is waiting to send their review until they hear from the chair. Not awesome! 

He's had these chapters for about three weeks now. I've managed to be a little productive in that time; put some slides together thinking I'll have a zoom defense, edited the first three chapters for the first time in months to clean them up. But I think I'm about out of things to do except drink, so that's what I'm going to do next. Happy Friday reddit, I'm going to go visit r/whiskey."
Should I do a second master's or a doctoral program?,"Currently a full-time grad student in education (curriculum & instruction), before I came back to school I taught third grade for several years. I'm interested in leadership, management and organizational behavior as they relate to public schools. I'm not interested in becoming a principal or superintendent, but I am very interested in helping improve leadership practices in schools/districts, improving workplace culture, etc. Ideally, after I finish school I'd work as a consultant, help shape policy, or work at a think tank. I also wouldn't mind working to develop professional development and training for companies

When I first started my master's in the fall, I had the idea that I'd do a PhD afterwards, but after a lot of reflection and talking to some professors/friends, I realized this wasn't a good idea. I'm passionate about what I'm studying, and I enjoy researching, but I'm not interested enough to sustain a 4-5 year PhD program and all the stress that comes with it. Plus, I have no interest in academia whatsoever, which renders the whole idea moot

I feel like I've got a few options, I'm just not sure which would be the best:

**Option 1**: I just go back to teaching after I finish my master's, teach for a couple of years, then see how I'm feeling and if I want to go back for another degree. This is the one I'm least excited about

**Option 2**: I could go into an EdD (Doctor of Education) program. From what I understand, these are geared towards people who want to continue working in non-academic roles, whether it's in a school/district, for a non-profit, in government, etc. This would still involve research and a dissertation, but is more about practical solutions. It would also take only three years to finish. The downside is that, for the most part, these degrees seem more intended for people who want to be principals/superintendents. While I'm sure I could find a different career, I also don't want to get into a program and then find out my non-administrator career options would be limited. On top of that, not all of these programs offer funding. Still, I found a few schools that are promising and worth looking into more

**Option 3**: I go into another master's program. One of the professors I talked to about this encouraged me to think in terms of ""return on investment"". In his words: ""If you can find a master's degree that gets you what you need and lets you finish in two years as opposed to several, why not do that? It gets you back in the workforce faster"". I was hesitant at first about getting another master's, mainly because I thought it'd look weird on my resume to have two rather than an MA and PhD/EdD, but the more I think about it, the more it makes sense (and I could be wrong, but I don't think too many employers would mind what the degrees are if the skills and knowledge are there)

I'm also finding a few interesting options if I go this route. For example, [UPenn offers dual degree programs](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/dual-joint-degrees), and I'd be interested in pursuing the dual program through Wharton and the Grad School of Education there (either Education Policy or Educational Entrepreneurship), though a couple of the others are also interesting 

**Option 4**: I go back to the workforce, but do online certifications through something like Coursera or EdX. No, these aren't full fledged degrees, but they'd still teach me valuable skills, and it'd probably be the most cost/time efficient way, especially if I could get whatever district I work for to reimburse my tuition. It makes sense in a number of ways, but I'm really not big on the idea of returning to teaching

This has been on my mind a lot recently, especially since I've been spending so much time at home. I'd like to make some kind of decision relatively soon, just so I can start studying for the GRE if I need to, and so I can have a bit of peace of mind regarding my future. Would appreciate any advice and opinions, so long as they are constructive"

What should I expect in a masters program vs undergrad?,"I graduated with a BA in psych in 2018, needless to say back then I didn’t take school seriously and just went through the motions. 

I’be just been accepted into Capella’s MPH program, I am going this route because I hated sitting in a classroom. I prefer to learn things on my own. This is the first time I’m actually excited for school. 

I was looking at the academic plan for me and I’m looking at it as “this is it?” or “I can handle double this amount”. I’m going full time, and my first session is one 4 credit class the remainder is two 4 credit classes. I spoke to my admissions counselor and they explained there’s only one class with quizzes, the rest is papers and discussions. Writing has always been my strong suit. 

What should I be expecting in a grad program? How much time should I expect to put in per week? How much should I expect to write? any other information would be great."

Is Oncotarget a predatory journal?,"Hi. For one of the PI that I really want to join, one of his previous visiting scholars had a paper published on Oncotarget and thus this paper is attached to his personal page. The director of my department said Oncotarget is a predatory journal and this can be a red flag. But this PI has an R01 NIH funding with a primary faculty member of my department as the co-PI. I'm really confused now. Is this a major red flag that this PI is problematic and thus I shouldn't join his lab? Like if a paper published on a predatory journal is such a big issue (assuming Oncotarget is predatory), then why he still has that paper attached on his personal page and had an R01 NIH funding with a co-PI from my department's primary faculty members? Thanks"
Unrelated Thesis vs Directed Study in my field,"Hello, 

I signed a contract when I was 17 with a university so they sponsor me to study my undergrad in the US and in return I would come back and do a MS degree at the university. 

I'm currently doing my MS in mathematics(did undergrad in Physics) and I'd like to do a PhD somewhere else when I'm done. I'd like to work in Symplectic Geometry but no one at the university work in this field. I found someone who work on projective geometry but it's not really something that's interesting to me. 

In my Masters, I can do either a thesis or take 3 directed study courses. I heard that a thesis can boost my chances of getting in PhD programs later. However, if I choose the thesis track, I'd have to do it on something that's not related to Symplectic Geometry. I'm not sure if I can do a thesis about something I'm not truly interested in. On the other hand, if I do a directed study for 3 courses, I may be able to do my directed study courses on Symplectic Geometry topics. 

Should I do a thesis in other fields or should I try to do my directed study courses in Symplectic Geometry? I'm the first in my family to go to college so please assume I don't know anything about graduate education"
Want a PhD... kinda lost on where to go?,Hi to anyone who is listening and willing to help. So I graduated with a Bachelors in ChemEng and I graduated with a 3.2 cum and 3.9 major gpa. I left school to see what industry looks like at this level and because I was a little scared about pursuing a PhD program. I wanted to know what I should be doing to get this acceptance? I currently am about 2 yrs  in industry and want to apply this December. I talked to two professors who would write a reco for me and I’m studying for the GRE and I have passed the FE and I’m licensed. I know academia is something I want to pursue I’m just looking for some advice and perspective really. I want to pursue a PhD in ChemEng with a focus on process engineering or kinetics depends on the program. I’ve been looking at a lot different schools and I want to know what do I to kinda focus in on 3/4 schools for me?
Reddit Graduate Advising: M.S. EE (Thesis),"So I've recently been accepted into Virginia Tech to do an M.S. in EE (Thesis option). They have offered me funding for two years. For my Ph. D, I want to work more in applied physics (think solid state physics, nanomaterials, IC design/micro/nanofabrication). So My current plan is:

-Do My Master's thesis on Antennas (specifically metamaterials)  to get a solid understanding of classical EMAG

-Take courses related to IC Fab and design to prepare me for my next step (Ph.D)

Problem is this will require approximately ~50 hours of course work. Many of the classes are upper-level undergraduate courses. Questions:

1) Is this achievable in 5 semesters (4 regular plus 1 summer)? Or is it more likely to take 6/7?

2) What is a reasonable way to balance the undergrad/grad course load?"
Any masters students here?,"Just wanted to say you are not alone, in your struggles."
I'm kind of lost so If you can explain it better,"So currently im on my last year of my Master's in Medical laboratory diagnostics and everywhere online that i've read, you can do a PhD after this Master's and thats what I would wanna do. But what i don’t understand is the terms ""undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate"". So in my country (Croatia) I would have to do now a postgraduate after the Master's (and the Master's is a graduate i guess). One lady at the ERASMUS support service office said i can't do a PhD instantly after the Master's, but first the postgraduate. BUT, on the other hand, online I see under the description of ""postgraduate"" falls a Master's and PhD. So yea, im kind of all over the place haha, so If anyone could make it a bit more clear I would greatly appreciate it.

I am now taking the same course a year later. He hands me the previous exams that were handed back to him. 

Does it count as cheating /violation of academic integrity if I use this exam as a resource to study?

Edit: It was a midterm handed back. Not a final exam. Final exams are usually kept by the professors in my school."
There’s an important discussion occurring at AskAcademia,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/e6l5ir/my_referee_just_sent_medo_not_apply_to_any_more/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

It won’t let me cross post but I just want all of you to understand what you’re up against. There are a good chunk of professors who will take your lack of knowledge about their own work lives as a slight against them, who view your letter writing as a burden, and who generally think that treating you with unprofessional contempt is acceptable.

I’m not posting this to have a debate. I’m doing it so that you can know that you’re not alone if this happens to you, to help you strategize approaching your letter writers, and to help you understand just how big of an ego many professors have.

Note there are a lot of them chiming in to support the student as well. Academia is a mixed bag of personalities but many treat humans as disposable. Know what you’re getting into, because this is not unusual."
Should I reconsider going to grad school full time in lieu of COVID-19?,"Hi everyone, I am currently working a full time job at a large tech company, but I am not fulfilled with the work and made the decision over a year ago to go into I/O Psychology. I've been admitted into a 2 year full time M.S. in I/O Psych program (expected graduation: May 2022) to my top choice, and I'm scheduled to enroll in the fall. I will most likely have to quit my job (they probably wont support part time work) and find a part-time research assistant job while at school. I'm also really excited - I'm passionate about the field, excited to learn, and excited to eventually get into a role I'll really enjoy.

However, I'm being advised to reconsider this due to COVID-19, and how it might put us into a recession similar to '08. I'm leaning towards going through with my M.S. because:

* I'm passionate about the field and want to work in it long term
* I will continue working a job that I'm not fulfilled with if I don't go through with my M.S.

Am I shooting myself in the foot by doing this? Do you think it will be extremely hard to find a job after graduation? I'd like to get all of your thoughts on some precautions to take during making this decision as well as any advice/insights. Thanks a lot!"
Take advantage of pass/fail? Any downsides?,"Hello,

I am a first year masters student, and my university just switched to optional pass/fail grading. You can select which classes to choose this grading option for by the end of the last regular week of the semester (before finals week). I have a 3.90 cumulative GPA, and I would ideally like to bolster it. At the moment there is only one course I am concerned about, and I’ll have a better picture of it when the deadline approaches. I will probably not go on for a PhD afterwards, but I’ve entertaining the idea and would like to keep that door open. Would there be any downside to strategically choosing which classes to change the grading option for?

Thank you"
Anything I should be careful to be the 1st grad student in a lab?,"Hi! I really want to join a lab and I'm rotating in this lab now. The PI is nice, people are nice. The lab has actually started about 10 yrs and the PI didn't have students before only because of some departmental relationship issues. I just feel this lab is the one since I have the excitement of going to the lab every morning after wake up. The only issue I concern is that I'll be the 1st grad student in this lab.

Tips on surviving a MS program? Especially combatting procrastination.,"In 10 days, I begin my masters which is an online program. I am pursuing a ms in clinical psych with duel specializations in applied research and forensics. I’m more than likely going to apply for a PsyD program. I will consider a clinical PhD but I don’t know if I would be competitive enough to actually get in (I’m in the Philly area and would prefer to stay here). 

I don’t have any real research experience except for some stuff I did during undergrad. But I will say, I love research. I have a curious mind, love looking at data and I loved writing research papers. Strange, I know. 

I refuse to let myself drop below a 3.75 GPA for this program. When I apply to PsyD programs, I want to have a few options not just one. 

My problem with school is I procrastinate horribly. I know I do it, I always have done it. I know for a fact it will not work in a graduate program. 

Any tips on how to survive and actually do extremely well?"

Medical & mental health academic accommodations in grad school,"What experiences have people had with requesting academic accommodation due to chronic medical and/or mental health issues, and what advice do you have to offer for someone attempting this for the first time? While I understand that the process will necessarily differ by institution, it would be enormously helpful to hear about other people's experiences dealing with the process, and what kind of accommodations were offered/agreed upon. 

For context, I have been struggling with anxiety, panic attacks, and very severe seasonal allergies -- all documented, though I am not actively seeing a mental health professional at the moment. After I had a meltdown earlier this semester when I had to go off my allergy medications for a week, my program director encouraged me to reach out to academic accessibility office. This is more urgent to me now, since I have relocated for virtual classes to my hometown, where there is a lot more pollen than on campus (warmer suburb vs. cooler city) and my mom won't. close. the. damn. windows.

At the moment, I'm planning to just request extended time for exams, which is an area where I feel is extremely impacted due to impaired ability to focus, and only do so via my allergist. (I am leery of how the university may handle any mental health diagnoses.) Is this a good idea? Should I ask for more?"

How many of you are in grad school for a subject you didn't study in undergrad? What was the transition like?,"I'm genuinely curious about what that experience was like for you.

Most of the people I know, including myself, studied undergrad subject A and went into grad school subject A, or a heavily related topic. So it was like studying economics and then going into the PhD economics track or studying math and then going into the PhD economics track. The former had a leg up on theory while the latter had a leg up on the math but both were similar enough to dive right into the PhD track.

So if you're in grad school for something not studied in ungrad, what is it like for you so far and why the change?"
Any good graduate programs in probability theory?,"I’m currently a junior undergraduate very interested in probability theory, but less so in statistics.

I’ve heard there’s countless statistics graduate programs in the US, but what about probability?  I can’t seem to find many programs online that offer a program solely for the subject.

Ive prepared the rest of my maths degree around the subject, taking undergraduate probability theory I-III, graduate real analysis I-III, and next year I’m planning on taking measure theory based probability I-II for some serious conditioning for graduate school.  

However, if this path is only going to lead me to admissions in a statistics program (I love statistical theory, but data analysis is literally hell), I’d rather reconsider.

Thanks."

Humanities: how do you come up with original questions/paper topics?,"Hi! I’m a masters student in religious ethics and I’m having so much trouble with paper topics. Basically, the feedback I got from every professor last semester is that my papers summarize the arguments from a scholar/philosopher/theologian well but I’m not actually writing anything interesting or new. I love grad school and I love learning. I love my field! But I’m feeling paralyzed when it comes to asserting my opinion or making original connections. I just don’t feel equipped with enough knowledge to do that yet. I know a lot of people say that but I’m scared I didn’t take enough foundational courses in undergrad. I really want to be a professor, but this is making me question my ability to be a true scholar. How do you come up with good questions in the humanities and move forward with confidence that you can write a ~20 page paper on it without summarizing someone else’s thoughts for >half of it? How do you write something original when you’re just doing a close reading/exegesis on a text?"
MFA in Industrial Design - Worth it?,"I found MFA ID to be the ideal degree for me, as I have a bachelor's degree in engineering in Computer Science, and I wanna do something related to designing, like Graphics Designing, UX designing, Game Dev, etc.

Retaking courses online,"I'm working on my application to PT school but it looks like I need to retake a few classes. Since covid19 is poppin off, I think I'll only be able to retake courses online. One of the universities I'm applying to recommended Portage learning and I also called Purdue Global and their representative recommended straighterline. They're both accredited but the only problem I'll run into is whether or not graduate school admissions will accept those credits or not. I was wondering if anyone had experience retaking courses through strictly online institutions. What did you use? How much did it cost? Class resources? At your own pace? Thank you!"
"Thinking about pivoting and changing fields for my PhD, is this a good idea?","I was an elementary school teacher for several years before going back to school for my MA (currently in my second semester, will finish May 2021). Over the past few years I've lost interest in teaching, pedagogy, etc, and become more interested in things like management, leadership, workplace culture, and so on, as they relate to education. I won't be the only teacher/former teacher to tell you that many admin/principals leave a lot to be desired and border on incompetent 

I'd been thinking about doing my PhD in educational leadership after I finished my MA, but after doing research into programs, I realized it's not quite what I'm looking for. A few days ago I was joking with my brother that I should just get a degree in business management, then started looking more seriously into the idea. I discovered Organizational Behavior, which is a lot closer to what I'm interested in. For example, a description from Washington University, one of the schools I'd be interested in:

*Olin’s Organizational Behavior program examines how individuals and groups affect and are affected by organizations and the people in them. As an Organizational Behavior PhD student, you’ll study organizations from multiple viewpoints, methods and levels of analysis—delving into management, leadership, negotiation, team development and conflict management, among other areas.*

This is exactly what I'd like to study, and I think it could be molded towards education as well. I know some people would think this is a random move or that you can't mix business with education, but frankly, I feel this would be a better bet for me rather than going the more traditional route

The other thing is that education is really insular - in my years as a teacher it felt like everyone was more or less mining from the same idea well, had similar attitudes/mindsets, etc. I can't speak about other fields, but public education is in desperate need of fresh ideas and perspectives, and I think having a blend of experience in the classroom as well as a background in business management could help me achieve that

What do you all think? Again, I know it seems like a left field move, but I think it makes sense (or at least, isn't completely random)"

How do you know a doctorate program is right for you?,"I’m beginning my masters in clinical psych with specifications in forensics and applied research. I love the justice system as well as why people do what they do, their social influences, and what made them go down the path that they’re on. 

After my MS, I planned on going into a doctorate program, I don’t really care if it’s a PsyD or clinical PhD. I’m open to both. 

I had a conversation with my mom yesterday and she’s 100% against a doctorate. However, she also knows nothing about doctorate programs. I attempted to tell her about TAs, assistantships and so on but she didn’t want to hear it. Her theory is it’s a whole lot of time with little pay off. 

I obviously tend to disagree with her. But it leads me to the question, how do you know when a doctorate is right for you? Especially wanting to go into forensics I almost have to get a doctorate."
One of my student’s final exam has a missing page.,"Hey guys,

I teach an introductory chemistry lab. I noticed while grading the final exams that one of the students has a missing last page, which could be due to errors in stapling the pages or something. What’s the best course to navigate this? Should I email her so that she could fill out the last page? Or should I just give her the points as if she took it?

He has no idea what to expect or if there will be any changes to the program exams given this unprecedented and chaotic situation. He also hates being cooped up and can’t study in one place, which really sucks since we’re trying to follow CDC guidelines and not go out.

Need Advice on a Participation Grade,"So, I'm in an online Masters program where a lot of the course is based around forum discussions with classmates, projects, and quizzes. In the last week of the course, we have a final assignment of providing the top 5 names of classmates that we believe contributed to our learning in the class.

For every classmate that puts your name down, you can receive 7pts. There is no cap on how many points you can receive, however, the syllabus allotted 40points (or 4%) of your total grade to this portion of the class. So, if you get all 40pts you get an A on this and any additional points you receive is just extra credit. Yes, I know that 7 doesnt go into 40 equally, no idea how they came up with this...

For me, I was only put down by one person, so I received 7 pts (lost 33pts) bringing my grade down from a 92% to an 88.7%.

My biggest question here is, in a grad school program or ANY program, how can 4% of my grade be subjectively judged by my peers to have this much of an impact overall in my course? I tried messaging my professor about this and they didnt view this as subjective so now I'm really stumped and just overall dont feel that this was appropriate. She stated that this was always on the syllabus and having meaningful and impactful discussions with peers is essential for grad school. I dont disagree but I received perfect scores on all of my discussion posts...

In every other category of the course I received nothing lower than an A- but in the end I was brought down by subjective judgment from my peers because no one wrote my name down as having an impact on their learning...

Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated.  Is this normal?  Is this even an acceptable way of measuring my time in the class?  Overall, it just feels so gross.."

I was going back to school after about 15 years and had been a creative artist my whole life. Always performed terribly in science and math and have moderate test anxiety. But, I was assured by my program director that I would do fine. 

Last year, I thought I had reached my final mental breaking point and if you know me, you know I’m a tough cookie, so that’s saying a lot. By some miracle I pulled B’s out of my ass for my final grades. Even after getting D’s on some of my finals. 

This year, first term back. Dreaded Microbiology and Chemistry. Took my finals on Wednesday, felt ok. I GOT ALL A’s!!!! I earned 93-98’s in all my courses. I still can’t believe it.

Should I take 4 math classes at the same time?,"TL;DR - I am a ""registered"" masters student in math, but I take undergrad math classes since my bachelors was in bio. In my bio bachelors, I took multivariable (including Stoke's theorem) and one class that combined intro to linear and intro to diffQ class. I took a gap year between undergrad and grad school, so I forgot most of math.

In my math masters, should I take real analysis, intro to proof, vector analysis (intro to linear algebra + stoke's theorem), and linear algebra (intro to some advance concepts) at the same time? 

Apologize for the long read in advance. I appreciate and welcome all constructive feedback. Thank you for your time.

========================================================================

My undergrad bachelors included classes A100 and A200. Not actual course numbers, but I modified for simplicity stake. **I took both A100 and A200 at the same time.** 

A100 - Multivariable Calculus that include Vectors, Partial derivatives, Lagrange multipliers,  Double and triple integrals, Spherical and cylindrical coordinates, Surface and line integrals. Divergence, gradient, and curl. Stokes Theorem and it's derivation to Green, Divergence, Fundamental Theorem, and General Stokes. 

For the midterms- I got a 

1. midterm 1 (vectors, PDE, lagrange) I got a 82,
2. midterm 2 (double, triple integrals, spherical, cylindrical, surface and line integrals) I got a 65 lol. Double and triple integrals are my weakness. This midterm was dropped.
3. midterm 3 (divergence, gradient, curl), I got a 85. 
4. On final (Divergence, gradient, curl, stokes theorem) I got an 88.

I forgot most of my calc 3 vector analysis knowledge. I got a B in the class though. 

A200 - A combined linear algebra and DiffQ class -  introduction to ODEs and linear algebra, Gaussian elimination, matrix theory, linear transformations, vector spaces, subspaces, basis, eigenvectors, eigenvalues and the diagonalization of matrices

1. Midterm 1 (ODEs - separable, non homogenous, homogenous, etc) I got a 91
2. Midterm 2 (Linear Algebra part - Gaussian elimination, RREF, matrix theory, linear transformations, vector spaces, subspaces, basis, eigenvalues). I got a 78 lol. I knew the concepts but damn the linear algebra symbols were tricky AF. This midterm was dropped.
3. Midterm 3 (Diagonalization of matrices, using linear algebra to solve ODEs, 2nd order) I got a 92.
4. Final (Combining everything with an emphasis on the midterm 3. Also more linear algebra symbols). I got a 87. 

I got an A- in A200. Class was curved and average was like a 85. I got an 88.5 in the class as a whole and got an A-.

&#x200B;

**This was my undergrad math classes. I took these 2 classes at the same time. My undergrad bachelors math was harder than my current undergrad classes (B100 - B5000) classes in terms of depth, homework, and problem solving.** 

===================================================================

Now the undergrad classes that I'm taking for my masters. 

B100 - Multivariable calculus  - Vectors, infinite series, Taylor's theorem,  partial derivatives, multiple integrals. I took this class and I got an A. 

***This multivariable class was so much easier than my bachelors A100 class. There was no vector analysis and stoke's theorem. Just basic vectors and infinite series and multiple integrals. I still suck at multiple integrals though.***

Now should I take 4 math classes at the same time?

1. B200 - Matrices,  determinants, general vector spaces, basis and dimension, eigenvalue problems, first order ODE linear equations, vector field theory, theorems of Green, Stokes, and Gauss. **B200 looks like a combined A100 and A200 class. So my 2 undergrad math classes combined to one**.
2. B300 Intro to proofs -  Basic proofs in set theory, logic, mathematical induction, relations, orders, functions, Cantor's theory of countability, and real number system 
3. B400 Real Analysis  Sequences, properties of continuous functions, derivatives and differentials, functions defined by series, integrability and integrals, convergence of function sequences. 
4. B500 Linear Algebra -  Vector spaces, basis and dimension, matrices, linear transformations, determinants, solution of systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, Jordan form, and image processing 

&#x200B;

Should I take all these 4 undergrad classes at the same time? 

Some things to consider:

1. My undergrad cumulative gpa was a 3.23. I went to an engineering school to study bio lol. The math was so much harder and more applied with some sprinkles of proof and theoretical. 
2. My quant GRE was bad too. I didn't study and got a 159 or 79%. I am still surprised I got into a math masters program lol. 
3. My advisor told me that I don't need intro to proof before taking real analysis. He wants me to take real analysis so I can be better prepared for grad level math which I'm going to take in the Fall of 2020. 
4. Time management wise.
   1.  intro to proof only meets Mondays and Wednesday. 
   2. Real Analysis meets Tuesdays and Thursday
   3. Linear Algebra meets Tuesday and Thursday after 2 hours after Real Analysis is done.
   4. Vector Analysis with some linear algebra meets Mondays and Wednesdays after 2 hours when intro to proof is done.

I don't have any other time commitments. It also takes me 1 hour to commute to school. I still have some struggles with multiple integrals and changes of basis. 

&#x200B;

Do you think it's worth it? Given the fact that I took some DiffQ, Linear, and Stokes theorem class (but I forgot it in my gap year), can I take 4 undergrad math classes at the same time? Should I drop intro to proofs? 

Apologies for the long read. Thank you for reading. I appreciate all advice. Thank you for making it this far in reading."
(need advice) Supervisor moves out to another school,"So as the title said, early this week my supervisor told us that they'd most likely to move to another school in about 4 months. At the name they'd move, I'd have a semester left of my Master degree in the current school (school A) . I want to continue to Ph.D and had sent out registration for the program in school A (am an international student so paperwork admission is early)  and then I found out that the new school's (school B) admission had already closed. I can't really wait for a semester since the scholarship I have requires me to continue straight from Master or it will be cut. When my supervisor told me, they said I could finish my master as school A's student and then continue in school B. I don't mind doing that if my financial situation was better but because school B's area is much much more expensive and other expenses, the school B's dormitory is the only feasible place I could live in. I have asked my supervisor if they think I could get a room there, but their email replied was like ""Can you just email or phone them?"". It kinda broke my spirit to be fair since I know my chance would be small if I try to get it on my own (the dorm prioritize their own students after all) and they told me not to tell anyone about her moving because it's not official yet. I have looked up potential new supervisor but I feel like I couldn't contact them because it's not official yet. I feel rather helpless because I don't know what to do for my last semester...

If any of you can give an outsider perspective or advice on what I should do, I'd really appreciate it

How much prior knowledge does it take for a Master's in Business Analytics?,"I am a Political Science undergraduate and I took my electives in Economics, Data Science and Business.
Due to that I will be admitted for a Master's in Economic and Business Analytics. Do you think it will be hard for me, succeeding in this Program without majoring in Economics or Business? I don't need excellent grades, just want to make sure that this Master is doable for me.

The program starts with a few basic courses in Economics, Business and Analytic Methods (Econometrics, Data Mining etc). After that you can specialize in a few areas and I guess I would go for Analytic Methods and Digital Economy."
Looking for advice for forming committee for qualifying exam later this year,"Hello all,

I am in my second semester of graduate school (PhD program - electrical engineering). We are required to take the qualifying exam within 12 months of entering the program. I’m looking at roughly a late July of early August time frame to complete it.

We are required to form a committee of 3 professors from our field, none of whom can be our major advisor. My question is, as someone who is still pretty new to the area and university, how can I start forming relationships with professors prior to asking them to serve on a committee? 

One obvious alley that presents itself to me is to meet with them to talk about their research. But I’m not sure how to continue the relationship beyond that meeting as I have limited exposure to people on campus (I work/do research for my advisor most of the time at a lab off campus)?

Any suggestions will be helpful!"
terrified to start drafting,"hey y’all, and happy new year! I suppose the post title says it all—I’m scared to death of beginning to draft my masters thesis. I have plenty of research material and notes to go on at the moment, and my advisor also told me I’m in a good position to start rough drafting. he also said he’d like me to have at least a little something on paper before classes start up again next week. but I don’t have anything because I know it’s going to be bad. I know I have to let myself be imperfect—that’s the whole point of a “rough draft,” after all. I’ve told numerous undergrads who were scared of writing their capstones the same thing, yet I have a hard time with it myself. has anyone else felt like this, and if you have how did you get yourself past it? I know I ought to get something on paper since it’ll be easier in the long run if I get an early start but I can’t mentally get over my fear of imperfection 😖"
"Issue with committee member. Could use some advice? Long post, TLDR at bottom","I defended my masters in June of 2019. I passed and got a job that I’ve been at since October. During this time, my committee/co-authors and I have been working on my manuscript via email. During my time as a grad student I never had any issues with my committee members or any of their edits except for one. One member refused to help most of the time, because he saw it as doing it for me. I get where he was coming from so I just taught myself instead of going to him with any questions. And before you ask, no I could not have replaced him on the committee unfortunately.

Now, out of the blue, he’s asked me for all of my data, and all of my Rstudio code under the pretense that he wanted it for another student who is working on a similar project. So I sent him most everything. However, I had a feeling he really just wanted to rerun all stats and analyses. Turns out my suspicions were correct when my advisor told me that my committee member had rerun everything without including me in this discussion. I am lead author on this manuscript, and I don’t appreciate that 1) he lied and 2) he didn’t even discuss with me that he wanted to rerun the analyses. He’s now emailing me for the original files and a key to match up the files to their designated number. Basically he’s not trusting me to have even done the most simple thing in matching up a key.

I’m unsure how to go about this. I don’t want to burn any bridges here, but at the same time I don’t appreciate that I’m being excluded from any and all discussions about this. This is my first lead author paper and I feel like I’m not learning how to go about being a lead author (isn’t that the whole point of being in school? To learn?!). This committee member also has a tendency to do everything for you in the classes he teaches (he’d always just write the r code for you in his informatics class) which is ironic since he refused to help me.

Additionally, my current supervisor (who knows all of my committee members/co-authors well) told me that I have my degree and that I owe this member nothing. I am unsure what to do in this situation. 

Apologies for the long rambling post!

TL;DR: Feel like I’m being pushed out of my own thesis. Unsure what to do!"
What are some of the more lucrative masters level majors/topics outside of STEM?,"...or easily admissible programs for lateral moves. 

Title says it all! Just curious what your thoughts are. Open discussion, no harshness please!"
Found out I actually am not going to have retake a class!,"I’m taking a class called Fate and Transport of Chemicals in the Environment and I got Cs on the midterm and the final. I thought I was going to fail the class because my overall grade would be a 77. I was pouring over reddit and reading how a C is equivalent to an F. I though I was going to go into a deep state of terror and depression. Then I read my syllabus and it not only said that there is a curve, a 77 is considered a B-!!!! This means because of the curve, I’ll probably get a B or B+ in the class!!!! I thanked Jesus, Allah, Buddha, Vishnu, and the universe in general what a good day."
Thinking of leaving or changing my program,"I’m currently an MS student in an Environmental Biology program, specifically studying freshwater fish. I’m in my second semester. My advisor and lab have a field station a few hours away, which is where I am expected to work this summer as a lab technician (it’s heavily funded by the state and we have a bunch of surveys we’re required to complete as part of that funding), and that is where I would be collecting data for my research.

I’m not far along at all. I should be most of the way through my research proposal and have my committee at least mostly established. Instead, I’m still trying to figure out what to do. I only have a vague idea of my project. I really get little to no support from my advisor, who is very busy and seems to expect me to be far more independent than any other advisors appear to expect from my peers. 

The worst of it is that despite this, I’d expect myself to be further along. I’m not farther along because I don’t care. My interests lie in marine and estuarine ecology, not freshwater, and turns out I’m not all that interested in doing research. Academia kind of just annoys me at this point?

I’ve already had some mental health issues the past year or two that are of course affecting this, but despite the fact that I’m doing better mentally and emotionally now with medication and healthy life habits, I’m as uninterested as ever. 

What I’m considering right now is switching from an MS to an MPS. There is an all coursework option, or a professional option where you do an internship and present a capstone on it at the end. The benefit of this would be 1. Doing something I’m more interested in obviously, and 2. Since it’s within the same school, most of my credits I’ve taken should apply easily. Otherwise I could apply to a different state school. Downside is many deadlines have passed so I would have to start in the spring, or narrow my options to those with later or rolling deadlines.

The major downside to this is losing my TA assistantship. I’m in state, and could take on some loans, but that doesn’t help my day to day situation. I’d have to find some sort of part time job to pay for rent, my car, etc. Or take out some extra loans to help fund that. Not to mention that teaching (I teach the introductory biology lab) is my favorite part of this degree so far. Which I think also says a lot. I dread going to my shared office and seeing my lab mates, while I love helping my students during lab, having them for office hours, and planning my section. 

I’d love people’s thoughts, opinions, questions, advice, etc. anything that you think might help me"
Does anyone know how to link Zotero library to Dropbox/ Box/ Google drive?,I was hoping I can link my Zotero library to anyone of these cloud storage to back it up. anyone has an idea on how to do that? Thanks!
I'm dropping out of grad school.,"I had my last final today & it was an absolute trainwreck. I didn't expect to do well at all, but it was even worse than I imagined. I might as well have not even bothered studying.

Regardless, I guess it doesn't really matter anyway. I will be dropping out of grad school. I have been absolutely miserable during the entire experience. I was miserable during the application process & ever since I started attending grad school I have been overwhelmed with thoughts of not wanting to be there & how I'm wasting my time. The professors I had were absolutely awful & the classes were a slog to sit through.

I can't see myself having a future in general, but grad school is definitely not going to help me in the long run. Especially being that I never wanted to go in the first place. I've posted a lot on this sub to vent my frustrations with everything & I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who took the time to respond to me. While I will admit there were many comments that did not help me as well as many people that were flat out rude to me, I do appreciate those of you who were kind & patient with me.

My future is extremely bleak & I can't imagine any good will come out of out, but at least I won't have the misery of school added to the mix anymore. This will be my last post on this sub. Good luck to all of you sticking it out in grad school. I wish you al the best!"
Would you get your masters if the company provided no financial relief?,"I am looking to further my education in hopes to pay dividends later on in life in regards to opportunities/salary.

I am 25 and entered the work force after getting my BS in Economics. I have built up around 3 years of experience and am looking to pursue my masters, online preferred, to separate myself among peers. 

The question I have is, would you pursue your masters if your firm did not help at all? I have heard many people recommend going for a masters only if the company helps. I have also heard that going for a masters is beneficial if you are looking to change the course of your career (I am an Econ major working in the Accounting dept. No desire to pursue an entire career surrounding accounting)

The biggest obstacle, along with everyone else, is if the payoff exceeds the cost. Has a masters propelled your career? If you got it while in the workforce, would you have gotten it without any financial relief?

I am eager to learn more about Econ and challenge myself to complete a masters program. Just want to make sure it will pay off at the end, especially on zero discount.

Appreciate the help everyone"
"Thank you r/GradSchool, also a question","Hi all! I have made a few posts on here and wanted to thank you all for your great advice. I did finally finish and submit my thesis this past Friday. Now I am preparing my defense presentation, but I had a question. Do I just present the same info on my paper? I feel like committee is going to be extremely bored if I just present the same information. Also, what the heck makes a good defense?"
Great end to a stressful semester,"Fall 2019 semester was definitely a stressful one. I just completed my 3rd semester in a STEM PhD program and I’m still recovering. My program requires us to TA a lab class in our 3rd semester. There was a lot of pre-runs and solution prep that had me working more than 20 hours a week to insure everything was ready for the class. I then took two class to fulfill my fellowship and program requirements. I then decided to take the qualifying exam (an oral exam that tests our in depth knowledge in our field). All of this plus extensive research experiments for my thesis project. I’m so happy I was able to pass all my classes and my exam and I’m making great progress in my research. 

PhD is hard and stressful but we can all do it and don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Hope everyone had a great semester as well."
Anyone from NYU School of Professional Studies?,"Anyone here an alumni, current student, or has applied to the Master's in Global Affairs at the School of Professional Studies (or just SPS in general)? I have a couple questions which I would greatly appreciate if anyone answered:

- Can the program be finished in one year instead of the two it usually takes?

- How much are tuition costs for a regular student (American citizen, unfunded)?

- Is it possible to transfer gracefully into an academic PhD program after? I know it's very much a professional school and degree, so I was curious if it was possible to use this as a stepping stone along your way into an academic career. Any anecdotal stories or data-driven stuff appreciated!

Thank you so much! It's remarkable how rarely I've seen this program discussed online, so apologies in advance for the baby-tier questions!"
Pursuing a master's/PhD in I/O Psych as a business major," 

I'm  graduating in May with a degree in Human Resources Management. While  I've enjoyed this field, I've found myself more drawn to I/O psychology  and social psychology, wishing I majored in this field instead. When I  graduate, I will have 9 - 12 hours of undergraduate psychology  experience under my belt (research lab, general psych, and social  psych). I didn't enjoy school til this last semester, and as a result  (and losing my father), I have a 3.15 GPA.

I  spoke with a professor today who took the time out of his day to tell  me his career path, how he went from business, to I/O psych, and finally  to social psychology. I believe that if I were to pursue an extended  education in psychology, I would certainly need a PhD to make $100k or  more.

I'm trying to figure out how I should go about getting a PhD - some options are below:

A)  Work full time & have my employer pay for grad school - perhaps  online? I'm worried about being overwhelmed and sacrificing the quality  of my education if I go this route.

B)  Go to grad school ASAP, and take on student debt. Potentially work  part-time at the university, and receive tuition assistance of some sort  due to being an employee of the university.

C) Pursue a PhD program (though I doubt I could get into one due to not majoring in Psych as an undergrad, and my GPA).

My  biggest concern with doing a PhD is the amount of my time spent doing  this. I don't want to take a long break from school only to go back, and  I don't want to spend more than 8 years on a PhD. Ideally, I'd get my  PhD over with in the quickest time possible, so working while pursuing  it may not be ideal either. My school (University of Tennessee) does NOT  have an I/O master's program, but I would be interested in going to  MTSU for a master's in I/O... Another silly question I have: Would I get  my master's in I/O, and then my PhD in Psychology or would it have to  be I/O Psychology?

Thank you!"
Who is planning ahead to acquire those Capstone points?,I have three more years to complete my program. I get so many invites from my university to attend several events so it's a good way to plan ahead!
"I'm a non-thesis masters student, will that hurt me when looking for jobs?","I'm currently in my school's non-thesis masters program in environmental biology. My advisor from undergrad recommended I do the non-thesis option because I wasn't entirely dead set on knowing exactly what career path I want to pursue. I'm considering doing work within the field of fisheries, but now I'm worried that I might not even get considered for a job unless I have thesis work I've done. I'm still looking at other career paths I want to go towards. I'm interested in doing field work and specifically something environmental but like I mentioned before I'm worried that I won't get a good job without thesis work. Sorry if I'm rambling here, does anybody have any experience or recommendations on this? Anything would be appreciated. Thanks!"

Should I go to grad school?,"Hey guys, I'm thinking about doing a master's in Architecture program next year and I am trying to figure out if grad school is even worth the headache.

I'm also really interested in pursuing architecture as I wasn't able to pursue it for my bachelor's. I also heard that a lot of schools pay for you to do your grad school program but is that common?

Where to obtain PDF copies of BMJ articles/sections unavailable on BMJ.com (or unavailable on PMC pre-2008)?,"Hi,  I was wondering about where I might be able to source sections of the  BMJ as PDFs, that are presently only available in online non-PDF form on  [BMJ.com](https://bmj.com/).

For instance, the article,

Midmer, D. Cinemeducation: a comprehensive guide to using film in medical education. BMJ 2005; 330 doi: [https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.330.7503.s232-a](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.330.7503.s232-a)

(available at [https://www.bmj.com/content/330/7503/s232.2](https://www.bmj.com/content/330/7503/s232.2)) is provided in webpage form with no PDF links.

Being  a pre-2008 article, most articles would be on Pubmed Central. But I  have found that this and some others like it, specifically those that  don't have page-number suffixes (in this case: 's232-a'), are not  available on PMC either (in this case, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/issues/18603/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/issues/18603/)). Have I misunderstood its location within PMC? Or is truly not there?

And what are the options to obtain PDFs of post-2008 articles that are not available as PDFs on BMJ.com?

Hence,  my query is, whether and how it might be possible to obtain PDFs of  such articles (without scanning the physical journal itself).?

Thank you."
I want to become a genetic engineer. What master's should I pursue?,"So as the title states, I want to become a genetic engineer. I plan on getting a BS in either biotechnology or bioengineering (my state does not offer any degrees in Genetics). Where do I go from here?

Information about Masters in CS/Visual Computing at Saarland University - I asked some questions I had in mind to a few students and thought I'd share their responses for other prospective students.,"I had got an admit for Visual Computing at Saarland, and I'd asked around about the university to a few current/past students. Just thought I'd share their answers for everyone who might be thinking of pursuing a Masters here. Note that some of the information is specific to CS/Visual Computing, and may not hold for other programs. I've numbered the answers, where each number corresponds to a specific student's answer. I've copied their answers verbatim, except fixing typos and removing personal details.

**Q1: As a Saarland student, do you have a chance of getting to work with  researchers from MPI and DFKI, while being a Masters student? For  instance, do a lot of students get to do their Masters theses at  MPI/DFKI/any other research cluster? What does this depend on, your  grades/the program you're attending/networking with profs?**

**A1**: Yes. As a master's student, I am involved with MPI-INF as a research  assistant (HiWi). Yes, there are plenty of masters students who do their  thesis with these institutes.

**A2**: Yes, you can get work there. I know countless people who started working at DFKI close to the start of their studies, even when they weren't good at coding yet. I also know people who worked at the Scheer Tower, CISPA, or others. It should be absolutely no problem to  find a small side job during your studies. For theses: usually, professors will openly suggest topics and you  talk about it to them OR you have a topic in mind, talk to a professor  about it and he will either connect you with people who know a lot about  the topic or do the supervision himself. It is mandatory that your  first supervisor is a professor (being a professor is something more  unique in Germany than in in the US, it doesn't just mean ""lecturer""). I  know people who did their theses at DFKI combined with their side job, I  know some who did it just with a professor and I personally did mine at  a company, working together with one professor. Lots of possibilities.

**A3**: Yes, for instance I am doing my master's thesis in MPI and I know of a lot of students who do it in either DFKI/MPI.

**A4**: Yes, grades matter but so does prior experience. It can help if you've taken a course with the prof. in question but isn't strictly necessary. If you're going to reach out to someone it's also important to write a nice motivation letter describing your research interests and to make connections to what research is being done in the department, i.e. send a targeted application and not a generic one.

**A5**: Yes - grades are important - how you performed in their classes - you can go talk to them.

&#x200B;

**Q2: What do most Saarland graduates end up doing? Do they go on to do a PhD  at one of the associated research institutes, or move to industry? I did try to learn this from LinkedIn but it seems skewed towards research.**

**A1**: Research. Masters students, for some reason, do not seem to be very  motivated to pursue positions in the industry. I am not one of them, and  I hope to go back to the industry as soon as I am done.

&#x200B;

**Q3: What's the student:prof ratio like, in Visual Computing (VC)? I mean, are profs usually responsive to individual queries/project discussions?**

**A1**: Not sure about ratios. Some lectures have a lot of students, some hardly  have 20 students attending them. Really depends on whether it's a core  course, whether the subject is easy e.t.c. Professors have office hours  during which you can approach them. As far as I have noticed, they encourage discussions.

**A2**: I don't know the exact ratio but it heavily depends on the courses.  There are courses with hundreds of people but also some with only 20-50.  It would be interesting to know where you're from. University here is  QUITE different to the UK/US. Brits and Americans have told me that in  their home countries, it's more like school, there are more resources  (because of the higher costs) which means you can go to the professor  any time you want and they will always be able to help you on the spot. In Germany, university expects you to be more independent, meaning  that you're expected to work through things yourself. Obviously you can  email your professor anytime and go to office hours and whatnot but I've  often heard complains from (especially) Americans that they felt like  they don't get enough support. The job of a professor in Germany is  research + teaching as opposed to only teaching, so they often have a  LOT on their schedule and are therefore more busy. But obviously, you  will find professors who are very communicative and some who are not. It  all depends.

**A3**: I don't know the exact number, you can check the visual computing page for the number of profs. Some professors are very helpful/responsive some aren't. Usually the ""in demand"" professors are less responsive especially if you send them unsolicited (also not very well drafted) emails asking for thesis/hiwi, etc. You can check online for general rules of emailing profs, there are some good posts on Quora/StackOverflow.

**A4**: As a general caveat, I completed the masters a few years ago and things have changed a little since then, mostly that more students are applying/getting accepted and the course selection/profs have changed a little. It depends on the course, but usually the ratio is OK and in any case all profs/tutors usually have a one-hour weekly slot for office hours and it shouldn't be tough to get an appointment to discuss whatever you need to.

**A5**: Depends - if you have a good profile - yes.

&#x200B;

**Q4: Do you happen to know anything about the courses and the quality of teaching in the VC program?**

**A1**: VC program has a lot of overlap with the computer science program, though VC is more restrictive in the sense that you *have*  to take some mandatory lectures. Quality of ""teaching"" depends really  on the professors. The courses, including the assignments, are usually  designed well, and the assignments will contain material not covered in  the lecture. This is not necessarily a bad thing.

**A2**: I do not. I would think that at least some of them would overlap with normal CS courses. For those I can say that some people say that CS courses at Saarland University are a little more theoretical than at  other universities. But CS here has an excellent reputation and I've never known a graduate who did not get a good job afterwards.

**A3**: Again, just like at any university the quality varies but there are some profs who are exceptionally good at teaching e.g. Prof. Weickert.

**A4**: The quality of the program and the courses are very good.

**A5**: I was in VC program - I changed to CS - it has a rigid structure and is quite math heavy.

&#x200B;

**Q5: It's stated on the VC program site that students can take core CS  courses and go on to get a Masters in CS. Do you happen to know people in CS who've done this successfully? I was wondering what the experience is like.**

**A1**: I know students who switched from VC to a CS degree, because they found  the bucketing system in VC (i.e, you have to complete x credits in topic  y) annoying. Computer Science do not have any mandatory courses, and  hence you are never forced to study a topic you do not like.

**A2**: I do not. It's not that uncommon to take courses from other specializations though. A friend of mine did a bachelors for both  ""Medieninformatik"" and normal ""Informatik"" (CS).

**A3**: I know some people who have switched halfway through, it isn't complicated. Some people do it because the course requirements are less rigid for CS and you need slightly less coursework because some credit points go towards your MSc thesis presentation. If you're asking about getting a double degree, you might have to take some additional courses and do a second thesis.

**A4**: As a VC student you can transfer to CS if your grades are good, the courses you can take as a CS student and a VC student are more or less the same.

&#x200B;

**Q6: In general, what's the work/life balance like? I understand different  people have different paces and lifestyles, but assuming that a student  doesn't slack off and doesn't party much, is the pace of teaching  manageable? For instance, do you see people in CS/VC struggling to keep up?**

**A1**: Depends on the quality of the student, and more importantly, the choice  of lectures. You would have an easy time coping up with HCI  (Human-Computer Interaction - it is a core course) if you decide to take  that course. But instead, if you are taking a mathy core course like  optimization, naturally you will find if a bit more challenging.  Personally, I think that the coursework is very manageable. If you are  having a hard time, there's no penalty associated with dropping out of a  course. And students tend to do this a lot - they usually sign up for a  lot of courses, realise later that a) they don't like it or b) they  like it but do not have time for it, and this is very normal behavior.  For instance, I attended machine learning lectures this semester (core, 9  credits), realised that I have too much on my plate and there's no way  I'll find time for all the things that I am doing. Also, the ML course  this semester was offered by the math department, and I am not a fan of  their notations and love for theorems. So I stopped attending ML  lectures, and signed up for an ""elements of statistical learning""  course. The topics are *very* similar to the ML course, but it is  just 5 credits (hence less work load) and they don't care much about  proofs. The point I am trying to make is, Saarland is very flexible. I'm  sure you will be able to find some combination of coursework that you  would be able to cope up with.

**A2**: Obviously extremely different from person to person. There are courses  that are known to be difficult and others that are known to be easier. I  think most people struggle with math the most, although this might be  more for the bachelor's than the master's degree. I think it should be  fine if you apply yourself a little bit. Semester breaks are long in  Germany (2-3 months twice a year, if you don't take seminars during that  time), so you always have some time to relax and cool down.

**A3**: Yes, it's manageable. Finding people to do assignments with helps. Often you are encouraged to hand them in in groups.

**A4**: Depends on the courses you take, but yes, people do struggle if they  take more difficult courses, it depends on your priorities, what type of  courses you want to take, how fast you want to finish, etc.

**A5**: I didn't have a work-life balance - especially during my thesis - it's all work - for me it was...but it's manageable.

&#x200B;

**Q7: For administrative tasks and filling paperwork, do you need to know fluent German?**

**A1**: Yes. You must know German. But I don't speak any German. I managed anyway. So will you ;)

**A2**: I'm gonna say no because of all my American friends surviving despite  not being close to fluent in the language. You should prepare yourself  for LOTS of annoying bureaucracy at the start though. In the first few  weeks, there's gonna be a LOT of annoying paperwork that has to be done.  But people are usually helpful enough and if you struggle too much,  Germans you will meet will help you out with translating.

**A3**: No. Although I was already fluent in German, so I can't speak to this much. Isn't a barrier as far as I can tell from friends.

**A4**: You can get by without knowing German, you can use Google translate and all but in some cases it may be difficult.

**A5**: No no, you will get help - so don't worry.

&#x200B;

**Q8: I read that Saarland dormitories have a long waiting list. Do you happen to know how far back you need to book a slot, to have a good chance of  getting it?**

**A1**: The waiting period is a semester. I ended up getting a one-room apartment (studio?) in the city.

**A2**: Yes, they are always at full capacity and especially during winter  times, it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to find a spot if you don't apply  extremely early. The majority people live in so-called WGs  (Wohngemeinschaften) which just means shared flat with other people  (usually other students). This is the most cost-efficient option if you  don't generally dislike people (and also you will make friends much  easier).

**A3**: No idea, but it's tricky to get a place and it's best to start as early as possible.

**A5**: That's tough - don't rely on it.

&#x200B;

**Q9: Do you have any specific website recommendations for student apartments (shared housing) in Saarbrucken?**

**A1**: There are a lot of WGs (i.e shared apartments). I sort of wanted to live alone, and hence got my room [here](https://www.studentenwohnungen-saarbruecken.de/unsere-wohnangebote-fur-studenten-saarbruecken.html).

**A2**: The most common one by FAR is [https://www.wg-gesucht.de/](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/). The optimal places for students are St.Johann, Mitte or  Alt-Saarbrücken. St.Johann covers much of the city center and also  includes the ""Nauwieserviertel"" which is basically the student's quarter  full of pubs. Mitte is also in the city center but usually more  expensive and Alt-Saarbrücken is a little quieter, further away but  really cheap to live in. Dudweiler is also extremely close to the  university but it's VERY far away from the inner city and anything..  exciting. But they have a nice climbing gym at least.

**Q10: Are there ample computing resources available to students at Saarland?  For instance, for deep learning experiments or rendering, one would need  access to GPU servers with high RAMs, often for a prolonged duration  (long-running experiments/simultaneous experiments). Are such resources  readily available to students?**

**A1**: Yes. I took a high-level computer vision course (offered by MPI) on my first semester and the course involved a project, and all students were given access to decent GPUs. I don't remember exactly, but I think they were P100s. Basically, you SSH into MPI/University resources through a VPN.

**A2**: We had this at the Computational Linguistics department to train language models etc. and our department is soooo much smaller. So I would definitely think: yes. But that's a question you could ask the Studienkoordinator.

**A3**: Not sure about this. The deep learning boom took off when was already a research assistant in the computer vision department.

**A5**: I would assume..

&#x200B;

**Q11: I've heard that the style of teaching math is rather ""dry"" in German  universities, with less emphasis on proof motivation and visualization,  and more on terse theorem-proof sessions. Would you say that is true to a  large extent, or is this dependent on individual profs?**

**A1**: That statement is true, but fortunately not so much in Saarland. But  then again, I avoid proof-heavy math courses like the plague, so I might  not be the best person to answer this. The assignments do sometimes ask  the students to prove something, and I sometimes do get get annoyed  with this.

**A2**: Yes, that's what I hear a lot too. Math can get rather dry. My math  courses were nothing like CS courses, so I cant compare them with mine.

**A3**: Depends on the professor, and I don't know what your reference point is here, but some do place a lot of emphasis on theorem proofs, and some don't.

**A5**: That's true - I think.

&#x200B;

**Q12: Is there any academic advantage/disadvantage in enrolling in one semester over another, for VC?**

**A1**: Nope.

**A2**: In my experience, the winter semester is the 'normal' one to start for  MOST pograms. That's when you have most of the introductory courses,  etc. But i can absolutely not say if this is the case for VC I'm afraid.

**A3**: Depends on the courses on offer, but one nice course for the first semester which I believe is offered in the summer is the Image Processing and Computer Vision course. Ultimately, I don't think it matters too much.

**A5**: Not really - not imo

&#x200B;

**Q13: How does the process of getting MPI to approve you doing your Masters  thesis there work? Is it like, you get good grades in a set of courses  related to the work of a researcher in MPI, contact him over email  asking for a RA position, then have an interview with them? Or do you  discuss your interests with one of the profs at Saarland, they recommend  your name over to a researcher at MPI, who then contacts you for an  interview?**

**A1**: In my case, I just went to the lecturer at the end of the course (i.e  the last lecture of the course) and straight up asked him ""Is there a  way I can contribute to your research, preferably as a HiWi?"". He said  yes. By this point, he was familiar with me (I was a regular in the  class), and my assignment grades were good. He asked me to email him,  and mention that we talked after the lecture, and that was it. He read  through my resume and offered me a HiWi. Usually, if the  professor/lecturer does not know you, you go through an interview - I  didn't have to since he knew me. Getting a masters thesis at MPI follows  a similar pattern - turn up for lectures offered by people from the  MPI, get okayish grades at least, and then walk up to the professor and  ask. If you seem motivated enough, the professor will usually be happy  to have you as a thesis student. *Some* departments, like D2 at  MPI-INF (Multimodal computing and machine learning) are quite in demand  (everyone and their grandmother wants to do a thesis in ML+CV) and thus  has a GPA cutoff - 1.5 or better. That's an unfairly high cutoff, since  unlike the US, Germany does not have grade inflation, and you have to be  really good at giving exams to maintain an overall GPA of 1.5 or  higher. However, regardless of your GPA, most departments will offer you a thesis if you do reasonably well in their particular course and show sufficient motivation.

&#x200B;

**Q14: How easy is it to make the switch from VC to CS (Do you need to maintain high grades?  Does it depend on CS student strength at the time?), and when can it be  done at the earliest?**

**A1**: It's quite easy. You just have to fill out an application form. Yes, you  must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher, and you can switch only after the  first semester. Getting 2.0 or higher shouldn't too difficult.

&#x200B;

**Q15: If I decide to take courses at a slow pace, can I stay and study beyond the normal duration of the program?**

**A1**: Yup. You have a whopping 6 semesters to complete your coursework (i.e 90  credits). And then you can take another semester to do your thesis, I  guess. There's some restriction - for example, you *must*  complete 9 credits by the end of your first semester, 30 by the end of  the second, and so on (I forgot the exact numbers). But yes, you can  take more than the normal duration of the program. Also, there's no  ""normal"" duration of the program. Most students I know take 5 semesters -  4 semesters for coursework + a semester for the thesis. But I took more  courses than recommended, and I'm set to complete my coursework by my  3rd semester. I'll probably do the thesis on my fourth semester and be  done with the whole thing, or skip my fourth semester altogether to do  an internship somewhere, though I don't have any internship offers as of  yet. But then again, I was fine with filling up all my free time with assignments and the HiWi job, and not working so hard for the exams. Long story short, how fast you  want to graduate depends all on you. If you go all in, and enroll for  courses during the semester breaks as well (yes, some courses are  offered during the break), then you *can* be done with your  coursework in almost two semesters, and move on to your thesis. That  puts the earliest graduation date as 3 semesters.

&#x200B;

**Q16: What is it like to do a HiWi job at MPI? I mean, what does your day to  day work look like? Do you actually get involved with the prof's  research and get to publish stuff?**

**A1**: This varies *wildly*. I think I won the HiWi lottery though. I  somewhat contribute to the research (i.e helped build a research  toolkit). I am not micro-managed, and my working hours are very flexible, and I'm on friendly terms with my advisor (we get a beer  together once every few weeks). But as far as I understand, what I have  is an exception and not the norm. An overwhelming majority of HiWi jobs are web dev stuff that  do not usually lead to a publication. However, if you do a good job,  you dramatically increase the chances of getting a thesis there, or in  any case, your advisor might be able to give you a recommendation letter  based on your HiWi.

&#x200B;

**Q17: Of the courses you've taken so far, what courses did you love? Also, are  there any courses that you'd blindly suggest to avoid (prof irregular,  teaching unclear with fast pace)? Of course, interests vary across  people, but I'm just trying to get a general idea of the department's strengths and weaknesses when it comes to teaching.**

**A1**: I'll give you a short summary of the courses I took last summer semester:

a. IPCV (Image Processing and Computer Vision) - well structured, you  get a very good understanding of image analysis (sobel and gaussian  filters, fourier transforms, optical flow etc), and the lectures are interesting.

b. (HLCV) High Level Computer Vision - Offered by MPI. Lectures are *bad*  \- they're not boring but there are 200 slides per lecture and yet the  professor (Bernt Schiele) finishes early. I remember explicitly asking  him ""do I need a deep learning background for this course?"" and he  smiled and said, ""not necessarily, you should be able to pick things up  during the course"". I did pick things up, but only because my team put  in an insane amount of time on the assignments. HLCV basically drops you  at the deep end of the pool, and you either sink or you swim. But the  assignments and the project was worth it - I am quite confident with  pytorch now and the background I got really helped me with the other  courses. Once you go through HLCV, you can go through anything. Dr.  Schiele also explicitly mentioned that ""If you survive the first 2  assignments, you will survive the course"". I would heavily recommend  this course, but be prepared to slog.

c. AI (Artificial Intelligence). Waste of time. I took this only  because it was just algorithms, and it was a core course (9 credits).  This was supposed to be my ""easy course"", and though the assignments  were easy enough, the exam was a Kobayashi Maru. You are given 2 hours,  and until you write (and think) really fast, you can't complete the  exam. Given enough time, I could have scored a lot more. Makes me wonder  what they are trying to evaluate - my understanding of the subject or  how fast I can churn out algorithms? I ended up getting a 2.7 for this  easy subject, but I won't complain since I got my 9 credits without  working much for it.

d. TNIR (Topics in Neural Information Retrieval). My favorite course  last summer semester. The assignments involved reading actual research  papers and writing an essay comparing and contrasting them. Had a lot of  fun, and since you read a lot of research papers, you get a good idea  of the research field *and* a sense of accomplishment towards the  end of the course. But this can  be quite dry if you are not into NLP/IR.

e. German classes. Enough said.

&#x200B;

**Q18: If you do an internship at a company in the last semester, whom would  you work with for your thesis? A prof from Saarland or a company person?**

**A1**: For doing your thesis with a company, you have to get a professor from  the university to co-supervise you. Not sure if professors like doing  this. In any case, you can do an internship without it being a thesis -  you get 6 credit points for doing a ""praktikum"" - i.e an industrial  internship. The main reason students would like an industry thesis is  that they get paid there, while no professor would pay a Masters thesis student at the University.

&#x200B;

**Q19: I hear Saarland has a gym (Uni-fit). Do you happen to know how much they charge students?**

**A1**: Oh yeah, I use the uni-gym. It's around 20 euros a month for the students.

&#x200B;

**Q20: Is there anything else you wish an international student knew before joining Saarland?**

**A2**: Travel! Saarland is basically in the heart of Europe, you can get to  so many places. Paris is only 2-3 hours away. There are lots of German  cities to visit, too. There is so much to see and you should take  advantage of living so centrally in Europe. All my international friends  said that they loved how easy it was to travel through all of Europe. About studying here generally: never stress too much about  university, there is so much other stuff in life. Take time for your  hobbies, relax and to make and meet friends.  I consider some  international friends I met as some of my best friends to this day.  Don't see studying abroad just a cheap option to study but also to  broaden your horizons.

**A5**: It's a good place :)"
Received a rejection from a big journal with barely any constructive feedback.,"I received a rejection from a pretty big journal in my field, and I was very disappointed by the lack of feedback given.

Math Majors: Why did you go to grad school? Where are you now?,"Recently accepted into a BS/MS program for math. Basically I get to start work on graduate courses before my undergrad is finished.

I don’t have any real conception on what the job market is like for math majors. I’ve heard good things about data science and cyber security and I think I would like to work on projects like that. But to be honest I would take just about any sort of math-related office job.

Help with Mendeley,"I am having some issues, and I cannot find a solution. My area is Sport Science, and I am using APA 6th edition to cite.

Basically, some of the citations are wrong. For example, instead of only seeing the surname, often there are also the initials for no reason.

Just to give you an example of two citations created by Mendeley:

(Kavaliauskas, Aspe, & Babraj, 2015; H. L. Taylor, Buskirk, & Henschel, 1955)

The first one is correct, the surnames are mentioned correctly. The second one has the ""H. L."" at the beginning, and I cannot understand why. I looked at the paper details, and they are correct. Name and surname are indicated correctly in the details, in the correct order, and yet I can see the initials.

However, currently the potential reward is so high that I absolutely have to do my best to achieve it!

People who moved from academia to analyst/consulting work what is that like?,"I'm abd in sociology and thinking about leaving academia for a number of reasons we could all relate to. But I came to grad school directly from undergrad and have never worked in a ""real"" job before. Im thinking about analyst or consulting work.

I know I’ll be grading assignments and papers, but beyond that what will I really be doing? Will I be instructing? Because I don’t think I know anything good enough to instruct or lecture about it.

longterm relationships within and after grad schools,"# in happy longterm relationships, what resulting qualities or skills are more valuable than learning how to solve problems creatively? and why? what evidence supports your response?

**heres a quick example of sovling porbelms creatively:**

* before the laundry machine was invented, a big kind of a problem was girls didnt have much free time to do anything like develop hobbies or run for ceo prime minster president director of aircraft engineering etc
* i dont know the history of the invention of laundry machine but automating this process of cleaning clothes  in total saved time for ppl in general
* this was a way of solving a problem that nobody thought about
* creatively = outside of what is the norm at any given point in time

&#x200B;

in happy longterm relationships, what resulting qualities or skills are more valuable than learning how to solve problems creatively? and why? what evidence supports your response?

for example say the couple had the quality of cooperation, the question is why does that quality matter and what does it lead to? cooperation along with otehr qualities would be a precursor to creative problem solving

* the end result of what things lead \[to\] is what are    **resulting qualities or skills**
* i cant think of a better phrase atm
* see [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/asmvxc/til\_a\_harvard\_study\_found\_that\_hiring\_one\_highly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/asmvxc/til_a_harvard_study_found_that_hiring_one_highly/)

&#x200B;

other possible options i thoguht about for things that are more important than solving problems creatively are:

* **being open**\- being to new thoughts, and new ideas (that are based on good evidence and reason ofc), but thinking about it, this actually is just one of the many prerequisites to being able to solve problems creatively
* **loving the ideals & going towards the ideals**\- even if a couple had this if they didnt know how to solve porbelms creativly i dont see how this would be more important than solving porbelms creativly
* **initiative in starting new things**\- showing leadership stuff like that, umm i dont where i would place this in what is valuable, but its def not  more important than solving porbelms creativly
   * but maybe it actually is more importnt tho gotta tink abojt this one
* **compromise**\- ok this is really bad, and this is a large reason why solving porbelms creaitlvey is so much better
   * compromise = to give up something you care about and/or selfish about
   * compromise is really bad cos its \[not\] creating more value or more wealth in society, for example there's 1 pizza, to compromise theere's still gonna be 1 pizza at the end no matter, well i guess there'll be no pizza which is worst
   * or rent, landowners that rent from residents arent creating any extra value, the value is still the same at the end usually.
      * same goes the residents, they arent imporoving they arent making anything better
* **being thoughtful-** i dunn o what this word means its too vague and i dont know hwo to descibe it using words so there's no way to compare and see it was more important than being able to solve problems creatively cos i dun even know wat this means to be 'thoughtful'
* etc other things somewhere... duno where i put them..  cant think of anything else off top of mind atm

How to quit graciously,"I’ve done a lot of thinking over the past few weeks and I think I’m ready to say I’m going to quit my PhD program. What I want to know is how to do it graciously so I do not burn a bridge professionally with my advisor, given all that he has invested in me as a student. Others who have quit- what advice do you have on what to do/not to do? 

Context: I did my MS with the same advisor, and am currently about a year into my PhD program in engineering (starting off taking classes only part time). We have a good relationship and I think he is a fair, level-headed professor and I respect him. I failed my first try at 2/3 qualifying exams and am scheduled to re-try in late June. We submitted a couple proposals for research funding this year, but they have not been approved yet and I think I could pull mine out of consideration without too much trouble. My advisor and I have put a lot of time into creating these proposals, which is why I fear I might burn a bridge by quitting. Also, given that the university is closed, I would have to tell him over video chat, which might be unprofessional. 

Reason for quitting: I have many, from change of career goals to realizing I do not like or want to be involved in academia, ever. Mainly my career goals changed after being in industry for a year and I realized to get the type of job I see myself growing into I don’t need a PhD. I was left with the only reason to stay in the program being “call myself Dr.” which for me was not enough motivation to dedicate the next 3-5+ years of my life to a program."
Students who are older than you?,"Hello everyone! I am teaching a few classes this year to supplement my stipend. I'm running in to an issue I've never had before, and I'm hoping for some ideas on how to handle it. I'm teaching a Human Development class and an upper level research seminar. I have a student, who is in both classes, who is 5-10 years older than me and has 2 kids. I have 0 kids. She contradicts me at least once a class; since we are talking about child development, and she has children and I don't, she feels like she knows more I guess? And she does make good points sometimes. I don't want to discount her experiences, but it's an academic setting; we have to deal with the research. I also just feel so disrespected/undermined when she argues with me in class, and I can see other students rolling their eyes every time she raises her hand. What would you do?"
What are my options when I graduate?,"Hi everyone! I am in a masters program right now in electrical engineering studying neural engineering. I am trying to decide whether I should stick with this or BME when I graduate, switch to something with clinical options like clinical psych or an MD/PhD, or switch to a completely different field. Like many of you, I would love a job as faculty, even in a community college just to teach, but the chances of that are slim. I’ve had multiple internships in electrical engineering positions in industry and hated all of them. While it’s possible it was because the work was boring for someone with just a bachelor’s degree, I’m pretty sure I don’t want to work in industry. That being said, if I get my PhD in neural engineering, are my options really academia (unlikely) or industry? Are there any other options for someone with a PhD in this field? Are there any other related fields I could switch to that would give me more options, especially either in teaching or some type of human interaction (hence the clinical work idea)? 

Sorry if this doesn’t belong here, but there isn’t really a neural engineering sub so I wasn’t sure where to ask this."

Those who have started your careers, what did you do during grad school that helped?","I'm a 5th year and I am just so uninterested in doing any form of academic research after grad school. I hate how biased research is, how results are so fickle and most data out there isn't even reproducible, and how slow and unfulfilling it feels. I don't hate my research topic personally, but I'm definitely just doing it because it's my job at this point. I'm pretty much just trying to finish my program to get the Ph.D. and start my career.

Personally, I'm extremely interested in teaching, and education has always been a huge interest of mine. I want to be a professor so badly, but I don't want to run a lab or have to do research on the side. I love working with students and have a lot of experience in that. I honestly want to be a full-time faculty member at a community college or smaller school and teach a few courses every quarter/semester. That sounds incredible to me and like a dream come true! I feel like it's so taboo to even say that in grad school.

There are a few other career options I'm considering, but I would like to hear from y'all about your experiences! I don't even care about making a ton of money - I just want to be happy and do something I can enjoy doing without putting in too much more than 40 hours a week.

Those of you who have not done a postdoc, or aren't considering doing one, what are you interested in doing after grad school or have done after grad school? What are some things you did during grad school that helped you get your first position? What do you consider to be invaluable traits or skills for the career you got into?"
How do I report the duration of my research assistant job on my resume? (weird situation),"Given my circumstances, I'm not sure how long I can technically say I was working as a research assistant while a PhD student or even if I was a ""research assistant"" and not something else. Forgive any extraneous details that follow. It's just easier to lay it all out.

So, basically, there were two channels of funding, but for the same project. My department was funding me on a research assistantship which I used to conduct field work abroad--this wasn't just dissertation work, it also could be characterized as consultancy work, which is why it's on my resume. That assistantship had a clear start date and cut-off date, with regular paychecks. However, my adviser also got funding for the same project and had written me into that grant, but that funding came later and as a lump-sum. So during the middle of my field work I was able to get a one-time payment of $10,000. I considered part of that to be reimbursement for research-related out-of-pocket expenses (though there was no paperwork involved) and part of it was just general compensation for the work I did and was still to do. I have no idea what my ""rate"" was in the grant proposal so I have no idea how long that $10,000 was supposed to last me, but it wasn't until a year and a half later, and a whole year after my assistantship ended, that I finally was able to wrap up my end of the project and produce a deliverable. I had not been working as dilligently on it as I could have been. But even so, my adviser was so happy with my work that at the very end he decided to pay me an extra $4,000 still remaining out of the project funds. 

So what I'm confused about is how I'm supposed to report the length of time that I worked on this project when I really worked on it off and on and had really irregular payments. The length of time I was on a research assitantship (12 months) doesn't seem to fit, because I also got separate funding for the same job. The length of time from start to finish (29 months) doesn't seem to fit, because I worked on it off and on during that time. Should I perhaps figure out a daily rate for myself, then work backwards from the $14,000 I received from my adviser to estimate duration from that, then add it consecutively to the research assistantship? But what about resumes that don't require me to report salary? Is the 29-month logic legit?"
Does a Postdoc have to be in the same field as your PhD?,"Not suggesting a wild change from history to physics or anything like that - but say your PhD is in linguistics, could you hypothetically have a postdoc in literature? Or is it a very strict path and you have no real hope if it doesn't follow on exactly from your PhD work?"
Almost done with grad school with no immediate future plans.,"Hi, I had posted a while back about completing the first draft of my master's dissertation. Anyway, the review meetings with my supervisor went well (as well as they can get on video call and email) and I just have a few corrections to make before I submit the final document. I also have a viva to pass. Hopefully, by the first week of June, I will be an MA graduate. 

All this is nice and I am really happy about it, but I can't help but feel worried about the future. I have no plans to jump into a PhD at the moment and was hoping to look for a job and get some real-world experience. (I have always been a student, went into my undergrad and post-grad one after the other.)

But the COVID 19 pandemic has derailed everything. All the potential job interviews I had have been cancelled. I just feel very uncertain about what to do next. Should I just wait it out and apply to places around July-August? I just don't know what to do."
When does it make sense to start over post-PhD?,"Venting time. In my late 30s, graduated with a masters 9 years ago and a PhD just over a year ago--both related to park-management in a developing country context--have done absolutely nothing since. Have no professional experience or skills that are sought after in the general job market and jobs in my area of expertise are extremely rare (have sent 6 jobs applications in the past year). Only have one publication to date and no history of independently obtaining research funds so post-doc opportunities aren't happening either. 

Right around the time I graduated I thought my prospects were looking up. A government agency in one of the countries I did my research in wanted to hire me to do a project and had me outline a contract for it. Also, my adviser and I also worked on a proposal for a separate project that would give me a job for the next 2 years and serve as a platform for a lot more research. 

Long story short, the government agency gets back to me months later, not with a completed contract, but to inform me that they since realized they can't hire me directly and have to put the project out for tender (which I can't bid on myself since I'm a foreigner). So the contract I wrote, which is based entirely on my dissertation, ends up going to a consulting firm that's only interested the occasional skype call with me as a courtesy. Then I just find out today that the major proposal my adviser and I worked on was rejected because my adviser didn't fill out a certain form completely.  

I have spent the better part of the last year thinking at least one of these opportunities would materialize. I am now in the most desperate position I have ever been in my life and I'm not young anymore. I can't imagine being in a more humiliating position than I'm already in, so what I'm wondering is whether I need to start over and pursue another masters degree? Perhaps in something more marketable? I had no idea what a dead end a PhD would be if you weren't successful enough at it. For all my adult life I thought I was working towards a certain career path but since graduating it feels like my life is over. 

I guess just so this post isn't a pure rant, would I at least have some post-doc prospects if I could get 1 or 2 more publications out?"
"Graduate assistantship canceled due to COVID-19, are they allowed to without the rest of my stipend?",I work as a graduate residence director at a DC university. Given the COVID-19 epidemic the residence halls are now closed for the semester and I am relieved of my duties. So salary is a stipend of $7500 for the year however it is distributed on a bi-weekly basis; are they allowed to not give us the rest of the stipend? They haven’t given us a direct answer yet.
What Experience Would Have Helped in Grad School?,"So I have about 8 months left of my gap year before entering a PhD program focused on genomics and evolutionary biology. What kind of experience or skill do any of you wish you had before beginning graduate school, or what would have helped things run smoother?

Thanks guys!"

[Advice Needed] Was a TA to a coworker during grad-school and now I’m feeling ostracized,"So as the title says, I TA’ed a course during grad school and now a couple years later I just started a new job and turns out of one the students from the course is my coworker. Since starting it’s felt very cliquey and then eventually the student/ coworker expressed that they were very unhappy with their grade from the course. I thought it was a joke at first but it’s come up several times now and I’m not sure what to do. I can’t really apologize, can I? What do you all think?"
I graduate from my MS in December. Is a PhD right after a good idea?,"Hi all. I’m currently a second-year MS in Biology (ecology-focused) student, and am interested in pursuing academia. However, I’m not dead set on this track, especially now that we are in the middle of a health and financial crisis.

As I graduate in December, I’m a little stuck on what to do. We all know academia is not the kindest field as is, so is trying to pursue it right after graduation a good idea? I understand how general this question is, but interested to hear from people that are in the same position or decided to pursue a PhD in 2008. Was having a TA/RA assignment a good thing? What market did you end up entering? How easy was the transition?"
Started a sexual harassment complaint and now lost friends,I finally decided to file a sexual harassment complaint against a student and somehow that student found out and turned 3 of my friends against me and made themselves look like the victim.

Yes I did try telling them I didn't like the comments before going to a point of authority.
Grad Students Who've Quit and Got a Data Science Job...,"How did you do it?

Ecology PhD and grad school is not for me. Luckily I've picked up some coding and data analysis skills, but not sure it's enough to land a data scientist or data analyst job. I have a bioinformatics project now which is my 1st chapter and I can still make ""progress"" during this crazy time but I am thinking of using it as a thesis and Mastering out. So my questions are:

Did you do a bootcamp like Springboard/Data Incubator/Dataquest?

Did you work with a mentor? How did you find them?

How many data science projects did you have on your resume/cv? What sort of projects were they?

Transitioning into professional workforce,"Hi friends,

Is anyone else struggling with imposter syndrome relevant to applying for professional work? I'm graduating with my Master's in May, and when I think about applying to jobs, I'm excited---but also scared out of my mind that I'm not actually qualified, or that I'll get hired but fail terribly, etc.

Rationally, I know it's just anxiety, but it's pretty overwhelming. I couldn't find community anywhere else, so I wondered if any of you could relate."
Do you translate in-text citations from a governmental agency in APA format?,"I'm translating a document to English and I was wondering if I had to translate the in-text citation of the ministry of education for example. I have a lot of references from the Ministry Of Education, Science, Technology and Innovations and the acronym in Albanian is different from the one in English. 

So in Albanian it's (MAShTI, 2020) while in English it would be (MESTI, 2020).

Thanks in advance for your replies."
Advice during time of cancellations?,"I'm a chemistry major going into my senior year of college. I have 3 on campus jobs relating to STEM and higher ed administration, research experience, and I was accepted at an REU... and all of it is gone due to COVID-19.

I understand why, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't upset. I feel like I had finally started to build towards the life I wanted for my future only to have it ripped away. I'm struggling to even get lab tech jobs in manufacturing plants because nobody is hiring. 

I'm debating whether it is worth it to go back for my senior year if my school is online, or if I should take the year off, work, and go back once I can actually show up to labs. This would, of course, be dependent on me actually finding a lab job of some type- if I'm going to take a year off, I should at least gain some relevant skills.

My goal is to become a professor at a PUI, but that's feeling less and less realistic every day and I'm starting to feel like I'll never have a career that I am passionate about and where I feel valued in my workplace.

Advice?"
Industry internship might conflict with advisor's company,"I have a weirdly specific question that I'm hoping to get some advice or insight into. I'm working with my advisor at the moment on developing therapeutics in a pretty small field. My advisor started a company last year that is still very new, and when I joined the lab he told me in no uncertain terms that I could contribute to its growth if I wanted to (that was part of the reason I joined in the first place).

Ultimately, I am interested in joining industry after graduation and my PhD program offers a pretty cool industry internship program that I can participate in during any part of my thesis work (with sufficient permission from my advisor). When I joined his lab, I told him that I would really want to participate in this program towards the end of my PhD and he was very supportive of this.

So here is my dilemma. Should I do an internship with a company that has direct conflicts with my advisor's company (especially if it has a lot of big shots in the field, a great working environment, and several opportunities to engage in the topics I am interested in)? Or should I find an internship in another field that might still develop the same skills/provide a similar network? I'm not super tied to this field so I'd be willing to change if necessary but I also feel like my skill set and experience would be best utilized in the field I am already in.

I don't want to do an ""internship"" at my advisor's company because it is so new and while I am definitely gaining a lot of knowledge and insight watching him grow the company, I think working at an established company would give me the career insight I am currently lacking."
Is the dissertation process outdated?,"As the title suggests is it outdated? On my way into school today, I was thinking about how tedious the dissertation process can be. Now, I have a few publications, I say this because of two reasons; a) you write it in a journal esque manner but provide extra details and b) students are told to try and publish their dissertation in which they will trim the fat anyways. 

If someone isn't a published researcher, I do see the value. However, given the current state of graduate school, it seems that getting publications force the dissertation to be a formality rather then a ""learning experience"".

"Don't know if my academic career path is common, but I think this is how academia should be.","Hi there,

I've noticed lately that when I speak to my peers in other labs/universities they think my career path is highly unusual, and are also highly surprised at what I've accomplished so far.

&#x200B;

In 1st year of undergrad: I met two quantum physics professors. 

I wrote to the first asking to do research and was accepted to the lab despite just graduating from high school. This prof privately tutored me in quantum mechanics so I could do the research, and I learned a lot of practical scientific knowledge from this(totally different from classroom science).

The second quantum physics professor told me about how academia works. After that I always knew what admin and professors wanted/expected from me and how to manipulate the system to my advantage.

&#x200B;

In 3rd year of undergrad: I met a mechanical engineering professor in a class.

I impressed him in a lecture and after I graduated he offered me a paid research position in his lab. The salary was decent (30% more than the best PhD stipends), so I took the job to ""try out"" academia before committing to it. I saw this prof 5 hours every week where he'd quiz me on what I was doing, suggest improvements, and most importantly teach me about how to write good journal papers and get them accepted (responding to reviewers too).  I did full-time paid research for 2.5 years, and published 2 first author papers and 2 second author papers in journals during that time. These papers I wrote on my PhD gradschool applications.

My boss moved to Vanderbilt University in the US, and offered me a PhD position with a normal stipend (not as much as I made before), but let me focus on filing patents and running a company should I choose to do my PhD with him. I did also get interviewed at a top school for a PhD position(Electrical Engineering), and am waiting for their reply.

&#x200B;

Anyway, most people think it is highly unusual that I had 3 professors in undergrad mentoring my scientific career. I don't understand how the next generation of researchers are supposed to be trained without good mentoring. Or how professors even survive if they don't train their students well (do they even survive?). 

This makes me think we have a ""succession"" issue in academia. The system thinks that PhD students will be PhD students forever, postdocs will postdocs forever, and professors will never grow old or retire. In other industries like say, professional soccer(or football for yall in the UK), they know youth team players become pro players, who become coaches, then football administrators or the coveted manager job. So at every stage they are preparing people for the very next step, and asking people ahead of them to mentor the people just behind them to make the transitions more efficient. Academia on the other hand, has no such forward thinking (maybe because academia isn't profit oriented). 

Since I'm basically a postdoc in any lab I'll be accepted to(even as a PhD student), I do try to have some sort of ""progression plan"" in place for anyone below me at any level (undergrad or new PhD students). I hope if more labs do this then people would feel less precarious or lost in their academic careers."

Does your PI introduce you to their peers/colleagues?,"Someone is visiting and one of my advisors introduced him to our post doc but not to me when I walked by them. 

He has introduced me to another colleague of his.

Question for Lab Visits as an Undergrad,"As an undergraduate in an honours thesis program, I am having some problems with arranging interesting labs for grad studies.

First of all, I really wish to stay in my current lab but want to expand my views on various experimental models and techniques used in other labs. Therefore, I wish to visit other labs.

However, my current honours thesis supervisor appears to question my visits to other places (3 in total) as it seems I do not wish to stay. Thus I have the following questions:

1) Does visiting labs for potential graduate study different than an undergraduate open house?
2) is it a waste of time for the professor to meet with me in this case where I might entirely be entering the lab in the upcoming year but has a general interest in their research?
3) Does the reputation of the school (note not the lab) matter for ones academic journey?

Thank you for answering my question."
Those of you with research with practical applications; how do you intend to move into the professional world?,"I don't want to talk too much about my own research since I'm more curious to what other people are doing, rather than asking advice on my situation, I guess. But here we go.

My masters thesis, and most likely my PhD dissertation, is focused on a particular concept within linguistics that I'm expecting to have pretty practical applications within the military, and perhaps in other domains as well. I don't want to say I'm ""pioneering"" anything, but I'm certainly in a niche that is not thoroughly explored in any capacity. 

Grad students looking at the future professionally -- especially in social sciences like mine -- are told that tenure track positions are few and far between, so I've spent a lot of time thinking about other ways I can utilize my experience in the job field, but I mean, don't we all just want to do the research we love and nothing else? 

So I'm curious, for those of you who have research that has practical applications, or have research that is innovative to some degree, how do you translate that to the professional world outside of ""I'm a professor now"", what do you plan on doing, where you can utilize and continue to develop your research in the scope of it's purpose and what it was meant to be used for? How do you find people that want you *because of your research* rather than want you because of your degree, if that makes sense? Or how do you get them to find you?"
Is it customary to send thank you emails after an open house,"Just attended and open house (already committed to the school) and I was wondering if I should send out thank you emails? I already accepted, they know I accepted, and we are both aware that I will be seeing them in the fall (I also had meetings with them and thanked them there as well). So, do I still send thank you emails?"
Is 25 to old to start an MPA program?,I graduated high school at 19 and went straight to college. Graduated in 5 years and took the last year to work on a publication with my professor. So I graduated at 24. After a gap year I want to get an MPA to work with my state’s natural disaster bureau. So I’ll be 25 when I start. Is this to old? I feel like a missed a large part of my life:
Speaking a second language other than English during meetings?,"I was invited to a research discussion group in which all of the members were from the same area with same second language. (we all work in the US). 

At the beginning everyone was talking in English, but after a while they switched to the second language. 

I could understand the discussion as I’m also a speaker. However some of the terminology they used were different then what I have learned before so i felt awkward. 

I was wondering what might be your reaction in this situation? Just curious about people’s thoughts"
On a scale from Leslie Knope to Jean Ralphio...,How douchey do you think it is to have diplomas framed in your office?
"Landed a prestigious award out of the blue, no idea what to do.","I'm going into the second year of my PhD, and applied for a fellowship at the urging of a couple of my committee members. Things were pretty rough over the past year, I was the only grad student under my advisor, there was no summer funding for me which was an unpleasant surprise, I have a huge case of imposter syndrome (went from bachelors straight into PhD), I even doubted choosing my program, etc.

I submitted the proposal thinking that at best this was good practice for the NSF GFRP application, and it would make writing future grants easier.

I just found out this morning that **I won the fellowship, and I am set for the rest of my PhD.** Tuition, a 110% stipend pay raise, travel money, summer funding, government partnership, everything. I can't go into more detail because the official announcement hasn't been made.

I'm still in shock. I can't believe it still. I'm not sure what to do with this kind of validation honestly, as I've felt like I've just been fumbling around for 12 months.

I wanted to share because I never felt like I deserved this kind of award, but for others who feel useless or lost, or that it's not worth applying for whatever you don't think you're worthy of, *""'You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take'- Wayne Gretzky""-Michael Scott**"
Should I tell my PI my future career plan in Industry?,"Hi. I don't really know whether I should tell my PI my potential future career plan in medicine formulation development. It might be a good thing for having the PI with me on the same page so she won't tend to train me to become a postdoc, but I don't want her to think I'm not interested in research at all and might be perfunctory for my work. My brother has a pharm company and we agreed that I can work for him at least. I'm not sure whether I should sync my plan with my PI."
Joining committees: is it worth it?,"I got an email yesterday saying that I had been nominated to stand for election as the representative for my region on the student concerns subcommittee for the national association in my country/field. I'm supposed to respond ASAP and let them know if I accept the nomination (after which there will be a vote).

I know that a certain amount of service is expected from academics. But I have no idea if getting involved in this kind of thing as a grad student has any benefits, or if it's just going to be a poor use of precious time in exchange for a mostly worthless line on my CV. 

Anyone have any wisdom on this they'd care to share? Thanks!"
Dealing with conflict,"I guess the flair is correct.
I am a graduate student at an evolutionary genetics lab that works with flies. As any live animal we need to take care of the flies so we try to recruit undergrads for general lab maintenance and fly husbandry, in addition to those duties, from the large scale crosses we generate a lot of data with phenotyping under the microscope. They also help with data entry which includes entering all of the phenotyping information in excel. 
Sorry for the long intro but it's important for the context. 
So new volunteer students training is a big deal. There are two grad students who are responsible for training undergrads. 


My question is how should I approach a new student dealing with a conflict? 


Today I approached a student who was late for data entry with the excuse I didn't know it was for me as you didn't adress it by name plus also didn't return her biosafety training even though repeatedly reminded her (which is the only way we can let them in the lab. So it was also a safety issue.). 
I was frustrated and upset with this student so I asked to return those things if she wants to show us that she is willing to work in the lab. The language is apparently very negative because I was fed up. But I let my advisor know by including her in the loop. However, she did handle the situation in a completely different manner than mine which undermines whatever I stated. 

I believe that we should be communicating our issues and I should be able to tell the student if I am not happy with her work. As the graduate student we are dealing with the research in the lab.

I am now aware my attitude is all wrong I am second year graduate student that needs to learn how to approach to these things. But I was wondering if you had similar issues or know nuances as to deal with a conflict."
Waiting to hear on First Author Pub Review,"Hi there r/GradSchool, I'm a History MA student who's been waiting for nearly three weeks to hear back from a pub I submitted to with my advisor's recommendation. The deadline for submissions for this issue was Friday (14th) - but the journal submission policy has the typical ""we are committed to getting you a decision as quickly as possible"" boilerplate. 

How long does it usually take to hear from pubs in the Humanities? I just want to stop having nightmares about getting a rejection for my research being ""derivative and repetitive."""
"Engineering incoming grad student, need help with telling a professor that i am disinterested in his research?","So i have been working with a professor for part of my undergraduate degree, but i am finding that his research is not within my interests. He is not my official advisor, but he has helped me a bit with a fellowship application for a project that i have no enthusiasm for. Before it progresses any further, i very much want to try to at least go for something i enjoy more. He has been very nice to me, and i absolutely hate that my spinelessness has caused me to not voice my concerns earlier, and i have thus wasted his time. What can i do? Any advice would begreatly appreciated."
Listing research in progress on CV for job search,"I'm in Computer Science and hoping to graduate this year. I'm looking into starting the job search soon and looking for research positions in industry.

Would it be advisable to list work in progress under Publications as ""In Progress""? My dissertation publications are pretty backloaded in that my most important work will be submitted just before I defend, so leaving them out of my Publications section will make my CV look very weak. Is there any additional value added to the CV if I wait until the work is submitted to put ""In Submission"" instead?

Thanks in advance!"
What would you do?,"While some of this may be field-specific (i.e. epidemiology or similar), I thought this sub would be appropriate to help me best approach this:

I am in my second semester of my PhD, and my advisor proposed I start working hours (15+ per week) in our clinic some floors down from my carrel.  I thought this was a good idea- they want to diversify my training experience, and said as much. However, so far all I am doing is administrative tasks that I did as a volunteer half a decade ago in order to apply to graduate schools. I wouldn't dare say these are below me or unimportant (they are vital to our data capture), but that I have already fought to get out of doing that day after day. 

**TL;DR: I am back to filing and data entry after years of working out of it. What should I do?** I fear that spending hours filing records and redacting could detract from my study quality and research commitment. I know that my advisor wanted me to get clinical exposure, but it is hardly anything ""clinical"" and more ""clerical."" I would be happy to shadow or observe clinical patients directly but it doesn't seem like that is on my docket at all. 

Am I off-base in objecting to this? Do I just need to do the time and shut up? Happy to discuss, especially if anyone has been in a similar situation."
"When listing employment on a resume, how do some of you list professional work you've done as a student?","I am building my resume and I've go to a university where much of our coursework is centered around real world assignments.

And for job title...since I wasn't officially employed...what is a good way to identify myself...intern/analyst/planner/consultant/advisor. 

I've had the opportunity multiple semester to do some really unique work for different organizations that would make my resume look strong. Some of my work as a student stands put more than my professional jobs. I want to list them ethically and not deceive people reviewing my resumes into thinking I was a paid employee of these places.  Im curious how some of you handle this and how you display it on your resumes..."
How do I market myself to industry employers as a biology PhD in a “non-industry” field.,"I’m in a developmental biology lab.

Applying for jobs.,"So a job posting has come up for my dream job. It's 2 year limited term, but it's a start. I think I have a shot but I'm terrified to apply - I'm very afraid of rejection I think. So how do I get over this feeling so I can get on with it and actually apply?"
"More work and less pay, but happier. I didn't expect this.","My funding ran out after 4 years in my PhD program and I had to TA starting this semester at a campus which offers a lower stipend than what I had before. To get to the campus, I had to buy a car and drive \~50 minutes each way for 3 days a week, which leaves me with much less disposable income. 

It sounds like a bad situation, and I thought I would hate it, but surprisingly, my mental health has actually improved. I found out I enjoy teaching (I lead a lab) and I'm more motivated to do TA work than research. This goes against what everyone else has been telling me, so I feel conflicted. Maybe the lonely grind is really getting to me and I like the temporary escape from the research work, or maybe I geniunely enjoy teaching and inspiring young minds, I haven't been doing this for long enough to tell. But I know I don't have to drag myself out of bed to go teaching, unlike when I have to go to the lab to do research. The downgrade in pay hasn't bothered me so much, since I'm a minimalist. I work more hours now, but I feel happier and more fulfilled. 

At this point, I'm actually considering a career focused on teaching, and I'm thankful that the TA experience has provided me with this insight. Anyone else with similiar experiences?"
Third letter Writer MIA,"Hi all, I need some advice.

So, I’ve submitted almost all of my applications for my doctorate. The first deadline was last night and submitted on Wednesday. That’s the first part.

I asked my recommenders over the summer and they were on board. I’ve stayed in contact since with periodic reminder emails. Last week, I noticed that my third letter writer had still not submitted her letter. So I emailed. She is notoriously bad at emailing. No response. After I submitted I sent another reminder email. No response. 

The first application was due at midnight last night. She still hasn’t submitted so I sent an email. At 7:00pm, still no letter, so I sent another email marked as priority and a very clear subject line. I begged her to email me back.

Nothing.

So I spoke with some of her other advisees and they suggested I shoot her a text because she’s more likely to read that. 

So at 10:00 I sent her a text explaining the situation, apologizing, and asking her to please get the letter in.

Nothing. Now it’s the morning after and she hasn’t responded or submitted. There are two more applications that have a TODAY deadline.

I’m at a loss at what to do right now. I also feel I have to tread water carefully because she is also my thesis advisor.

Do I go above her head? Do I wait it out? Am I screwed completely? 

Help."
How to update CV/Resume when you haven't been doing real research yet?,"I've been at my graduate school for roughly a year as a Ph.D. student. One of my advisors said I need to update my CV to reflect my time here and to ask someone I know for help. 

The problem is, she's been doing actual research work in the lab while I'm involved with a project at its very beginning and have mostly been reading and summarizing papers for my group. I'm not sure how to put this on my CV at all!"
"How to keep track of contacts from conferences, etc.?","Any tips on how you keep track of contacts from conferences or other academic gatherings? 

I’m a first year grad student and would love to get a system going for myself before it will take a lot of work to backlog contacts. 

Maybe it’s as simple as putting a tag on emails or literally saving the contact within google/outlook/etc., but I’ve also seen suggestions for using a full on database (Microsoft Access or similar, I’d imagine)"
Question regarding extended abstracts,"Hi, how in-depth should they be? I've never written one before.

I feel like the PhD in English is Silly.,"Hear me out: Year 2 PhD student in English here.

You know how we often degrade folks online for over-zealous defenses of Star Wars by saying “Lay off, it’s a movie about space wizards and glow sticks”? Not that we don’t love Star Wars, but in reality it just isn’t worth creating bad feelings over toward one another. 

When I get lengthy email responses to papers I’ve written, I get the same feeling expressed above ^.

I’m struggling financially, I have little to no time in the semester to do the ridiculous lit reviews necessary to appease these professors on final papers, I’m not guaranteed anything remotely close to a job, and we are just writing arbitrary opinions on books—!  So I find it silly to read these comments about my papers lacking source interaction when I can’t bring myself to take this thing seriously at all.

It’s just a vacation away from my former life for me. I just want to teach community college (let me have my composition & maybe one lit class to have fun with students) and be left alone for crying out loud.

TL;DR

PhD in English is a collection of people creating arbitrary opinions about books that often has little to nothing to do with the author/reader relationship on display by regular readers. Therefore, it’s hard for me to take this seriously (even after 6 years of study)."
How to ensure I’ll have a job once I graduate?,"Finishing a MSc in Computational biology in May, and I hope to immediately transition to a job. I have none of my own money, and I’m tired of living off of my parents. Additionally, I do not want to possibly live with my parents after graduation because 1) They live in the middle of absolutely fucking nowhere and this will severely hinder my ability to find a job in a good city (ie Boston, NYC), and 2) We argue about stupid shit constantly and they would most likely force me to stop taking the hormone replacement medication and force me to start living as a male again, and if I did that I would likely become too depressed to even search for a job. 

Sorry for the personal details, but some advice on how to easily find a job would be much appreciated"
What are some simple but not obvious tools/practices/ideas that made your daily life as a grad student more productive and that you are super glad to have figured it out?,"Example (This is very primitive of me) - I got to know about citation managers only after writing my first paper using Word where I manually typed in all the references! It made all the difference. 

I am about to start grad school and thought of having a heads up. These may not necessarily be academic in nature. anything that made your grad life a notch better is welcome :) "
I can’t tell if my department chair hates me or not,"Sorry this is a long one. 

All semester she has just been extremely rude to me and keeps giving me constant criticism, even though she is not my advisor. I mistakenly told her that I have a psychiatric disability and I feel like she is holding that against me, even though I do not need disability services or accommodations. 

I have a fellowship and will be teaching in the spring, and she keeps asking me “if I’m sure I can do it,” because I’m not “stable” enough. I have taught and TA’d before, and my advisor will be monitoring my teaching, so I’m not sure why she keeps insisting that I can’t teach. She does not ask the other students in my cohort if they think they can teach, and I feel like this is directed at me because of my disability and age.  I also should note that I am on medication and I go to therapy, and have not had a mental health problem in quite some time. I wouldn’t be doing a PhD if I knew I couldn’t do it. 

I should note that most of my cohort is older and I am one of the youngest PhD students in the program (24). She has also said derogatory remarks about my age, such as “you might want to wait until you’re 35 rather than 25 to start teaching.” What?

It doesn’t help that she’s the professor of two of my classes, but she retaliates against me in class as well. We were asked to prepare a teaching demo in one class and she emailed me to come to her office so that she could go over my presentation. This was nothing but criticism and she kept giving me bullshit excuses as to why my presentation wasn’t good enough. For instance, I designed my materials so that they are accessible to disabled students. She said that it wasn’t pretty enough and that I should use more color, even though I told her that people with learning disabilities are able to read black text on a white background most clearly. There are other instances where she lashes out on me which doesn’t happen to other grad students. Plus, other students in my class have noticed how she treats me and have asked me about it. 

It’s just petty nonsense and I cannot deal with the constant drama every week. She’s the department chair until next year so she gets to decide what classes I teach. I honestly just want to finish this semester, never have her as a professor again and not have her on my committee. I’m honestly not sure what the point of this post is, I just need to get this out. I’m not sure if I am being discriminated against or if I’m being sensitive."
Initiated a rotation,"Hi. I have met with a PI to talk about rotation, and she indicated her lab has spots and she suggested me to talk to some members. I didn't talk to anyone since I really like her work in bioinformatics and I want to start the rotation ASAP. I feel that experiencing the lab by myself being there is more valuable than other people's versions of what they feel. I'm also planning on talking to the lab members once I start the rotation since that PI's lab is pretty far away. I emailed her for starting the rotation, and she said that's alright and asked whether I have talked to some members. How should I respond without sounding not prepared? Thanks."
Down to two online MBA programs and wanted perspective from a different sub.,"Down to two schools for my online MBA. I am copying what I wrote in r/mba.

I’m 31, currently make $99k. Would spending $125k for an online mba ( with no option to take an on campus course) at UNC be a better ROI than spending $50k (with on campus course options) at NC State ?

I’m living in Raleigh so commute to NC State is not an issue.

Advice for dealing w/ (Borderline) Belligerent Student?,"Originally posted to wrong sub, so I deleted. Apologies if you've seen this already.

TL;DR Cocky kid without the skills to back it up tried to correct me, they were wrong, and it was a derail.

I'm a TA at an American R1 for context, and I had a student in a very low-level freshman level class take me on a two minute digression where they argued with me on a routine part of a calculation. Instructors make mistakes on blackboard calculations all the time, but in this case, they took issue with a well-established pratice. I explained that what they had in mind was unnecessary and told them not to worry about it for the moment (I was running out of class time). 

They were insistent that I wasn't approaching the problem correctly based on an aesthetic argument (""doesn't seem very scientific"") and I assured them that this is how the field handles these things. They then proceeded to make a comment that I genuinely missed as I hauled the whole class back on track, but what little I caught of it was snide. Because I didn't catch it, I couldn't decide how to respond, so I ignored it (which may have been appropriate even if I knew what they said.)

In retrospect and in future, I'll ask them to prove their pet theories mathematically on paper for me and move on when I'm pressed for time (not in those exact words). I am wondering if anyone has other advice."
Should I include a rotation on my CV if it resulted in a publication?,"I'm currently wrapping up my first rotation of a Biomedical Sciences PhD program, and I've decided not to join this lab for my thesis. However, since this project was entirely computational (my typical research is more wet lab), it progressed very quickly and I'm now getting ready to write up a paper for a mid-tier journal. I will be either 1st or 2nd author.

My question is, should I include this rotation under the ""research experience"" section of my CV? The only thing I'll be using it for in the near future is applying for grants/fellowships. Obviously I'll include the paper on my CV once it's published, but would a description of the rotation be beneficial to include as well?"
Best Planner: App or Hand-written?,"I'm a fourth year graduate student in a Chemistry PhD program. I didn't really use a planner before graduate school, and now I feel so lost at work without it. Seriously had a breakdown in the middle of the summer when I lost my old one and tried using a regular notebook waiting for a new planner from Amazon. 

I do it hand-written because I feel like I remember my schedule better, but sometimes it's really inconvenient since it's usually at my desk. I would like to use an app/electronic calendar, but all the apps I've seen are very rigid. They want a time and date for everything, but a lot of times I just want to write down the task as a To-Do that can be flexible or as something that is done through out the day without planning every detail (example: if I'm running a purification for a protein, I dont want to necessarily write out every step of my purification, just to know that I'm running the purification on that day). 

I know this a personal preference thing, but is there anyone out there who could suggest an app (Android/Windows)? Or is anyone out there who advocates for the hand-written option?"

Gap Year (pre-grad school) Employment,"First post, I hope this is allowed as I am not in grad school yet.

I have just completed my Bachelor's in Political Science in June, which I did really well in. I am hoping to pursue my Master's in polisci in September 2020. I'm currently taking a year in between, and I'm essentially wondering how important the work that I do in between that time is - for future employment as well as for grad school? In terms of title, job description, etc.? Or is this the period where I can just say screw it and take a job solely based on pay, not content?

I have been working at a tiny research-based NGO since July as a researcher. The NGO's mission is definitely interesting, but the pay, environment, and my manager is bad. I do nothing 95% of the time, it is extremely mismanaged. My title is great, job description is great, and it 100% looks good on my CV for the career I want (especially because prior to this, my experience has been mostly admin). It is also only a 30 minute commute (although I don't like working in the suburbs, it's convenient).

I was just offered a different position downtown, where the commute would be 1h30 each way (very long... but I'm also excited by the idea of working downtown). The company is what gets me though - fantastic environment and office, great perks and vacation, and it pays 10k more (which isn't a lot, but it's the difference in me being able to afford buying a car vs. not, for example). Right now I'm paid next to nothing.

Problem is, it's writing-based  which is sort of connected to my field, but has absolutely nothing to do with research. If anything, it's more on the comms and marketing side of things. It's definitely a step away from what my current job looks like on my CV (even if I don't *actually* do much - the description sounds like a really good first step for someone who does want to go into academia and research). The new position, although it has to do with writing, can't really be BS-ed into being connected to my field at all.

I appreciate any advice!"

It is a posting at a Dutch university for a university lecturer in the Study of Religion, with specialization in Religion in Contemporary Asia. I'm not familiar with the European academic job market, but it is a bit different from the American academic job market.

At what point does it become inappropriate to chat your advisor down?,"Edit: title should say CHASE not CHAT

It’s my job to graduate and I’m willing to do what it takes but I have to wonder what is appropriate in an advisor/advisee relationship.

Constantly saying they’ll follow up with me on stuff but unless I reached out first, it never happened. 

Rarely respond to emails. Not in the office usually and when they are, it’s a dash to their office for their time if you want ANYTHING. Common theme for all their interactions with students. I’m not sure what’s going on. 

Again, I know it’s my responsibility to get out and graduate, but I have to wonder what’s normal and what’s not. 

I graduate soon with my master’s and I did a lot of work with help from my co-advisor, independently, and with support from a great lab, but it’s just been a weird time. 

I got what I wanted (mostly) out of this experience, but the professional relationships part of it was difficult to navigate and I will need to continue understand how to deal with others when I go into industry."
Applying to a highly rank school that has a brand new PhD program?,"Hi all! I’m not sure if I should cross-reference with other subs, but figured I should try here first. 
So I need a bit of advice. I’m applying to Sociology programs for 2020 and had been fine-tuning my list before application season starts. 

A school (WashU in St. Louis) previously was on my list for public health. Seeing how high ranked I emailed the program and was kind of given a “nice” can’t wait for you to apply, but your stats aren’t probably good enough to get in email. So it stood on my list with a doubt on applying. 

That being said I just found out that the school will be rolling out a new sociology program. I emailed them and I guess since it’s new the program has a bit more “relaxed” that I meet the requirement. Also, I asked and was told I could work closely with the universities other research centers if my interests are close to them. 

So I guess the question is will it being a new program hurt me later on when it comes to finding a job. Or the school’s rep help?"

My grad department and school are fine with it, since it's under 20 hours a week of work etc.. 

I want to say yes and take the opportunity, since it's extra $$$ and invaluable experience. But, I'm also dissertating.

Speaking up a little can do a lot,"PhD student here. My department has a yearly overnight retreat. At said retreat, a specific faculty member harasses female students, yearly. He also is inappropriate outside the retreat but it is really bad there. Having now been to multiple and having been a target my first year (and traumatized) I finally wrote in the anonymous retreat feedback that “faculty that harass students should be banned from the retreat”. One comment, no names. That comment apparently was brought up at a faculty meeting which lead to a student meeting. That one comment and now we will be provided an anonymous survey to name the problem person and what we want done and that will be given to the department chair. 

When I sent the form in, I was angry and I was angrier because I was sure nothing would be done. Nothing big has been done yet but the fact that we are moving in a forward direction has finally given me peace of mind.

Tips for submitting an abstract for a poster presentation at a conference?,"Hey there, first time poster, apologies if this isn’t in the right place. 

I am in my second year of grad school (going for my MPH) and currently working full time. I am very interested in women’s health, and one of my colleagues also shares that passion. We found out that there’s a nearby conference later this year about women’s health, and that they’re accepting abstracts for a poster presentation. We decided we might try submitting something together about how our work in education empowers women and girls, and how that improves health equity in our county.

The only issue is that I haven’t submitted an abstract to a conference before. Ive looked at a couple of resources online, but I guess I’m feeling a little nervous about writing something that’s competitive/succinct enough to be accepted.

Yet another imposter syndrome post,"Oye. How do you snap out of having one of those imposter syndrome flus? What are some tricks that have worked for you and helped you get your head back in the game?

I’ve been kicking butt all year- fellowships, travel awards, research grants with 2 more large ones pending. I ‘thought’ I made strides towards my research agenda this year, until last week.

Presented the beginning stages of a paper and pretty much got roasted (so it felt). I’m not going to lie- the people who even took an interest are tops in their field and provided amazing feedback, but dang! I fully expected it to be brutal, but not THIS brutal. I left feeling that meeting like I’m the biggest loser in my department and not grad school material. More importantly like I’m an absolute waste of time on their end. It’s been about 5 days and still can’t bring myself to look at more than a sentence of the written feedback they gave me. Not even the notes I wrote down during the meeting. 

I’m sure it’s equal parts imposter syndrome and just graduate school burnout in general. 

What has helped you get your head back in the game?

****Edit: thanks all for your posts and comments, but I think the main question I’m asking is getting lost in the message so I’ll ask it again: What has helped you get your head back in the game? You know, self care tips that have worked for you?

- yes I know I need to ‘suck it up’ and grad school is tough and life is tough but this also doesn’t mean that I am expected to dismiss how I feel. Further, this isn’t my first bout of rejection. Like I said before- this is a combination of imposter syndrome mixed with just general grad school burnout that is making it hard for me to find the energy to push through. I know what has happened as a good thing, but it still doesn’t dismiss the fact that  I feel like garbage about it. That in itself is my issue at the moment. Techniques for limiting burnout/imposter syndrome. 

I don’t expect to have a hand holding session by my professors, either. Thankfully one of the reviewers has been amazing with constructive feedback, so this isn’t really a hazing issue. It’s 100% my issue. We have those hazing a*hole professors here too, and you learn quickly who to steer clear from. 

Anyway- thank you to those that got my initial question and offered some tips in my inbox. Hopefully this will clarify what I’m asking. :)"
Asking too many questions already?,"I have a committee for my upcoming Masters and I'm worried I'm already asking too many questions to my primary advisor. 

I don't want him to get annoyed with me even before I begin researching and at this point I'm just asking what classes he thinks I should take. 

Specifically he keeps mentioning the possibility of doing a research course but never explicitly tells me that he thinks I should take it. He is always vague with his answers when I ask, which leads me to ask the same questions again because I'm looking for a direct answer. In his last email he sounded annoyed and repeated information he already gave me so I just said thank you and ended the email thread. 

Then I realized that maybe taking this course is the only way I can work on my thesis which is why he suggested it, so now I'm thinking about asking questions about the timeline for a Master's thesis (I.e. when I should have a thesis proposal ready). 

Am I being too much? Should I already have asked these questions? Should I wait until I am actually at the school to start asking these kinds of questions? I'm honestly just trying to make the best decisions for myself so I don't fail or get overwhelmed like I did in undergrad."
"Halfway point in Master's, do I quit or tough it out? Will it be worth it?","I'm 5 classes and a Master's thesis away from finishing but I'm unsure of this degree as an investment. It would be an MA in Global Inclusion & Social Development. I am already $12k in debt and finishing would cost another $12k. I thought my current job would have better tuition remission, nope. 

It'd be 1.5 years more of working full time and studying part time. I'm not sure I want to make the free time and financial sacrifices for a degree I'm not sure will benefit me in the long run. Though I do like the courses. 

People have told me a Master's degree will help eventually in pay increases and job prospects by ticking off that box.

I hope to work for a humanitarian / international dev NGO org. I'm 34 though and time is ticking and I have some good work experience in the field of social services.

What would you do? Thanks in advance for your thoughts."
Does having a degree from a respected school matter for academic jobs?,"If I get a PhD from a school that’s very well respected (not quite Ivy League but close), will I get better jobs than if I get the same degree from a large state school?

I'm super excited about it, and part of my GAship involves co-instructing a freshman class that's basically meant to teach them how to acclimate and succeed in college (go to class, manage time, utilize campus resources, etc).

Also, phone disclaimer. Sorry.

Anyway, while I do have a year of instructional experience, it's at a high school, and with very small groups. I'm guessing the class size is going to be 25-30ish students, whereas I currently have a maximum of 8 students at a time. I feel confident in my ability to get through course materials and lecture, but my current role is much more scripted than I'm imagining this to be. I didn't write the syllabus for the course I instruct at the high school, but I'll be writing it with my co-instructor for the college course.

I'm not agonizing over content because I have my teaching materials. I know what will be covered.

The advice I'm looking for is more stylistic. What can I do to make class enjoyable, and feel like more than a lecture? How can I make students feel involved in this course in a meaningful way? One idea I have is taking students out into the town so they can get to know the community better.

Also, this actually does make me nervous: I was never a college freshman in the sense that many of them will be. I started at a community college at 20 and transferred, and I'm assuming they'll be more traditional freshmen who live in dorms and are right out of high school. What was that like, for those of you who did that? How can I help align my course to an experience I didn't have?

Generic and general advice is also greatly appreciated. Thanks, everyone."
Should I Put the Grad School I Will Attend Next Fall on my CV?,"I am a recent graduate attending graduate school next fall.  As of right now, I'm writing an application for a workshop I would like to attend, and they want my CV.

Citation and Common Knowledge Advice,"Hello World!

I am working on a cumulative/ e-portfolio project and I am wanting to include some “research” or “detailed notes” excerpts from my archive into a section displaying some of my previous projects. 

The majority of what I want to display doesn’t include traditional references but are from a professional online “course/training” from work as an intern.  

Though they are notes, they are delivered in a way that is highly detailed and formatted including diagrams and drawings that differ slightly from the original source, but the information is the same. 

TLDR: 

What I am stumped on is that in the field this would be common knowledge and I don’t want to professionally put out work that isn’t “mine”. However, the information obtained from the source is very concise, and I don’t want to muddle the work to claim it as my own. 


Question: How do I go about this?"
"Which degree is more in demand/offers more career opportunities, an MA in IR or an MPA?","Tried posting at r/askacademia since I want to go into academia as a lecturer, but it was removed after one guy complained and am waiting for mod response. So, I’ll try here.

So, TL;DR deadline day is coming up for me to choose on Sol Price at SC for my MPA or do my MA IR at NYU. SC will be slightly cheaper, but price isn’t a big factor to me as much as career prospects. From posting over at r/gradschool and a couple other forums it seems like MPA is more in demand and offers more diverse options, but I’m not sure. I want to go into politics longterm, but want to lecture at the uni level in the interim.

Writing in Word vs. LaTeX.,"Hi all,

I am battling between Word and LaTeX. I prefer LaTeX, my advisor prefers Word. I'm sure a lot of people have been in a similar situation.

What would be the best system/method to balance both? Or should I just stick to Word as my boss requires? I have been using latex for over two years now, I tried word several times and every time it seemed way less convenient in general formatting and math formulas.

What helped those of you in a similar situation?"

New job Iwant requires Master's - I'm one semester from an MA- should I apply anyway?,"Hi everyone
This firm I want to work for has a position opening that I want. It requires ""at least a Master's degree"" - I plan to graduate in Dec 2019 and have good experience, I think.

Tricky part is, the place I work now consults with them often. I worry if I apply and don't get the position my wanting to move on from my current employer will become known. (I imagine this is already assumed by most at my work though since I am in a low level position AND going to grad school)

Should I wait for my MA and then look for work or try anway? I'm also concerned I won't get paid at an MA level if I apply now.

Any advice appreciated!"
How do I politely say I want to wait to hear other offers?,"I have a meeting tomorrow with a professor who seems to really want to give me an RA position for my graduate studies.

"Those of you who either chose to leave or were kicked out of grad school - what do you ""do"" now?","Hello! I previously asked this question in another subreddit, but wanted to post it here for more info.

Anyway, I just wanted to know what other possible careers exist just in case I can't finish grad school. I am especially curious about the following:



* What was your initial reaction after leaving? How did you feel?



* For your current job, did you need to get any additional education or certifications?



* Do you feel any regret about being unable/choosing not to finish grad school?


* Is there something about your current job that makes you feel happier than being a grad student?

"While Studying for your grad degree, what type of job did you hold down and what was your living situation like?","Hello, I’m finishing up my first year of graduate school this coming May. I’m in an odd position.

Master's in Curriculum & Instruction to teach College-level English?,"Hey all! I'm looking at applying for adjunct teaching positions at my local community college in the English department over the next few years, but without a Master's degree, I know my chances of landing a decent position are fairly low.

"I will soon be the last remaining ""senior"" lab member, being pressured to stay after graduation as a post-doc. What would you do in my situation? Help!","In short, due to coincidental timing, a **huge** portion (~2/3) of my lab will be moving on by the end of next year either due to graduation, retirement, or opportunities elsewhere. All of the departures are on good terms and I legitimately like all of my coworkers. However, this includes the PI of the lab who planning retirement. Due to my experience in the lab (4+ years here), I seem to be a candidate for eventually taking over the lab. Indeed, at this point, the PI has already taken two steps back and offloaded many responsibilities to me (even though I am still technically a graduate student).

However, a few considerations:

* I enjoy the work, but over the past few years I've come to discover that I do **not** enjoy journal writing. My original plan was to enter industry, not become a post-doc.
* Is it normal to be concerned about the future of the lab? Since the departure of two post-docs (who have gone to form their own labs), I seem to be left holding too many of the keys.
* The funding situation is excellent, with the next several years already secured.
* The pay differential is worth considering. Personally, I would take a lower paying job to have a better work-life balance, but my University seriously gives post-docs ""the shaft"". The cost of living in my area is insane, and industry in my area *easily* compensates over double to what my University offers.

On one hand, I sincerely want the work that my lab performs to continue. I think the work we do has legitimate value to society in terms of potentially impacting lives. On the other hand, there are some ""cons"" associated with staying. If I stayed, I would: assume a mountain of administration duties, have to rebuild infrastructure to replace lost personnel, manage the remaining students, potentially teach a class once my PI retires, and of course all this with a post-doc salary.

Has anyone been in or seen a similar situation? Right now, it feels like I'm in the middle of a burning house and I'm the only person holding a fire extinguisher. I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or advice!"
Advisor accepted a position elsewhere...and I was the last person in the department to be told. What do I do?,"So, I’m in a bit of a bind. I’m finishing up my second year in an interdisciplinary (social sciences & humanities) PhD and, in the two years since I arrived, two out of the three faculty in my program who do research even remotely in my subject area have left. Today, after another round of coordinating emails with my exam committee chair (Also my intended diss chair), he lets me know he’s taken an outside position. Now I understand why everyone else in the department was stepping lightly around me today.

At this point, I’m left trying to re-assemble an exam committee out of a hodgepodge of faculty whose research is nowhere near my own. I don’t know how much they’re going to expect me to change in terms of exam list material and planned diss work—if it’s a substantive change I’m seriously considering trying to transfer or just quitting. 

So my question(s) are as follows:

1. How fucked am I?
2. Is it reasonable to attempt and apply for transfers when all the faculty collaborator options have departed for greener pastures? 
3. Can I (and should I) continue with my current plan and just bring in 3 people who have no idea what I do?
4. Is my advisor a huge dick for not letting me know sooner?"

I feel so dumb .. :(,"I just finished my first PhD year . And looking back, I feel I did not achieve anything. I am 27 years old.

And then I end up spending more than half ,of my defined 40 working hours , just surfing the internet .... and then I read how other PhD students work up to 60 hours a week and then I feel even worse. Don't get me wrong I love my field, I love to gain new knowledge, but at the moment I just feel so dumb and like an embarrassment ....Where do all this people get their energy ?

I want to thank everyone who commented on this post. I read every reply carefully and was surprised how your words made me relax a bit .

Of course I will never be like Euler , Gauß and Markow, and it is ridicules to compare myself to them , but deep in my heart I wish I  could be so brilliant ... where they so brilliant because they worked a lot (which I fail to do ) or because they were super intelligent (which I am not ) ... and do you think is most important quality when it comes to being a PHD student ?"

MBA vs. MHA: Not sure what to do.,"I am 26y/o, graduated with a BBA majoring in Management Information Systems and have been working as in the benefits administration field as an analyst for 3.5 years. Recently I moved from working as a third party administrator (Aon Hewitt & Willis Towers Watson) to a new job with a carrier (BCBS) in which I am doing Government Programs Strategy  analyst work (working with Medicare/Medicaid populations). 

My company is offering a special partnership program with a nearby university that would allow employees of my company to basically do a Masters of Health Administration (assuming we get accepted) through the university for at very little expense to the employee (16k for full program 15,75k in reimbursement ...plus fees/books for courses), which got me really excited because I’ve always wanted to get a Masters degree/MBA. 

Or 

I could start working on applying for an MBA program at another nearby university (mainly just prep and takef GRE/GMAT). The cost would be more (not sure the specific amount), but a good portion of the program would be covered by the company’s reimbursement policy. 

I’m conflicted in whether or not to go with the MHA or the MBA, as I am not as familiar with where my business background would be of an advantage if I tried to go down the path of a career in Healthcare Administration going forward OR going to get an MBA where I have a background in business and could go down a variety of paths if I decide to go elsewhere in the future. 

Any thoughts or ideas on what I could do with a business background and an MHA  or if it’s even worth considering would be super helpful! Thanks in advance. 

TL;DR - have a BBA in Management Information Systems. Have been working in benefits admin as analyst since college. New job offers **almost** free MHA but can also get MBA with reimbursement. Not sure what to do."
Starting to look for a post-PhD job. How?,"Hello! In the past few weeks, I've been reaching the realization that I am in my last two years and I should give serious thought and begin planning for what's next.

I'm a 4th year PhD student in the US (I am a Canadian international student but would like to stay in the US after my PhD) and my research is on the reproductive endocrinology of fish -- the fish itself is commercially important, but my work is more on the basic science side. I took the opportunity to learn as many transferable wet lab skills as I have been able to so far.

I am not particularly interested in academia, so I have been thinking about industry. Recently, I thought about the prospect of going into government, which - in light of a recent Reddit post - might be more suitable for me as opposed to industry (at least for now -- I feel as if I'm not competitive enough). I suppose the general question is: how? Or rather, where do I begin and what steps do I need to take to prepare for this transition from school into looking for/going into a career in industry/government? I understand this is incredibly vague, but the idea of ""what's next"" has been so nebulous given the length of the program that I haven't really given much thought to it until now. I am not opposed to post-doc positions, but not cementing myself into an academic career long-term.

I'd appreciate any feedback and guidance you might have to offer."

"My advisor owes me past-due teaching and research salary, refuses to pay, university is ignoring me","I'm wondering how I should approach this problem. I'm a PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, my former advisor owes me a semester of unpaid TA/GRA salary, and UT admin is ignoring my complaints.

I'm wondering how I should approach it because of my complicity in my advisor's wrongdoing. My advisor wanted me to TA their class, but wanted to officially hire a different student as the TA and hire me as GRA because TAs get free tuition and GRAs don't and my tuition is already paid for by other means. So I went along with this and agreed to be TA while my advisor told the department another student was the TA, since my advisor phrased it as ""we do it this way, or I don't hire you at all"". Then I never got paid as GRA. First my advisor told me it was admin's fault, they must just be slow. Then I talked to admin and they said my advisor started but never completed paperwork to hire me as GRA. Then my advisor told me they were waiting for grant money to come in, they would pay me when it arrived. Then the grant money arrived, I still didn't get paid, and my advisor said their memory was fuzzy and they couldn't remember the details of our agreement and that they didn't owe me money for teaching their class, why would I expect to get paid for teaching. I wrote this out in a letter with times and dates and contents of specific conversations and submitted it to the University's Office of Compliance, and they never responded. I sent them a second letter, asking whether they intended to respond, and they still didn't respond. So I don't have any written contract that I could take to court and the office that is in charge of policing malfeasance by staff and faculty is ignoring me. I suppose the next step is to go sit in their office and not leave until someone answers my questions. What other options do I have? And what type of trouble would I be in for going along with my advisor's plan to lie to the university about who is teaching their classes? I looked into labor laws, and unfortunately in Texas the statute of limitations for unpaid salary claims is 60 days, which has already passed, so I don't know what I might do outside of the university if University admin continues to ignore me.

Thoughts? Advice? Thanks."
Adventures in Exam Invigilation,"It's exam season and that means exam invigilation/proctoring is in full swing. 

I don't know if every institution relies on graduate students to invigilate undergraduate exams but regardless, I thought that it might be fun to share (read: commiserate) about the strange and funny things students try to pull during exams. 

From yesterday:

* The student who stood up in the middle of their exam, walked up to the front, tapped me on the shoulder and announced, ""I ran out of pages in my booklet."" Upon handing them a new booklet, I was met with a look of utter incomprehension and the question, ""What do I do with this?"" 

* The student who, an hour and a half into a two hour exam, asked to borrow an eraser. When I apologised and told them we don't have spare supplies hanging around, they asked instead for a pencil. When I reiterated that we do not have spare supplies on hand for students, they replied, ""Well that's too bad. I didn't bring anything to write with."" 

* The student who burst into tears when told they couldn't use their laptop during the exam. ""But how can I answer anything without Googling it first?!"" 

* ""Will I get extra time for this?"" No, you will not get extra time for having to produce your ID in order to verify you aren't cheating. Just as you will not get extra time for asking to go to the bathroom, asking questions, or requesting more booklets. 

Any fun or strange stories you want to share?

Grad School pathway decision?,"Thinking of re-applying to grad school (ph.d and master) eventually, like a year to two.

Just learned my friend got into a Biol-Ph.d program. Which, I am thrilled for him and makes me wonder if I can get into a chemistry ph-d program. Granted, I knew my friend was going to get in regardless due to his accomplishments. (multiple summer research, conferences, grad school support program, Undergrad thesis etc.)

&#x200B;

Compared to me who did a couple years of research and will wrap a undergrad thesis.

&#x200B;

I was applying last Fall but, stopped after one of my letter of rec writer felt as the letter she would have written wouldn't do much to the application process. (A polite no basically.) She is a professor who sits in our lab meeting and contributes, but is in a different field altogether.

I love the research process, but I believe it wont matter due to my lack of accomplishments compared to my friend who got into his program. So why waste the extra money, even though I already took the GRE.

And, I am going to start a job in the chemistry industry real soon anyways.

Job interview questions (non-faculty positions) that I could/should have answered better,"I know there are several people on this thread who are planning to work in non-faculty positions after they graduate.  Since I'm in the interview process for several non-academic jobs at the moment, I thought I would share a couple of questions that I was asked at a recent interview that I *could* have answered pretty well if I had more time to think about them. 

* If you have multiple, high-priority deadlines that overlap, how do you handle them?
* What's a project you've worked on that has had problems, and how did you solve them?
* When have you felt pressure to complete a difficult task, and how did you handle it?
* Describe a time you explained a complex analysis to an audience who was unfamiliar with the methodology. What did you explain, and how did you do it so they could understand?

Other than the last question, I think these are pretty general and could apply to most positions at most organizations.  And obviously, as a former or current graduate student, you've encountered a lot of situations like these questions describe.  I thought the heads-up might give people a chance to produce a slightly less rambling and off-topic answer than the ones I gave :)"
Anxiety surrounding relationship with my advisor,"I'm a first year graduate student (history specifically) and while my advisor is supportive, I'm not really sure what to expect as far as our professional relationship goes. He's busy and has tons of grad students. Do I check in with him all the time or do my own thing? (I'm super independent so I would have to consciously make the effort to check in more than a few times per semester). 

Because there is no guide book or ""model"" for how often/how to interact with my advisor, I'm super anxious about it. I'm stressed about a conference I just got accepted to- not because of the presentation, but because I didn't tell my advisor before applying and therefore am afraid he will be ""mad"" at me for applying without his permission and getting accepted. Something within me knows this is a bit unlikely but still. idk. I'm experiencing extreme anxiety waiting for his email response. "
How can I help a labmate give better presentations?,"My fellow PhD student gives poor research talks. I feel some impetus to help him improve, but need to balance this with how much time and effort I use to help him.

&#x200B;

I thoroughly enjoy giving talks, and since entering higher education, have been actively improving my abilities in this area, e.g., through asking for brutally honest feedback from an audience after a talk, reading books and literature on the matter, attending workshops (Alda Center for Communicating Science), and entering pitch competitions.

&#x200B;

When my labmate gives a presentation, I know he knows the topic thoroughly and has great mastery of the science, but it is also clear he does not know his audience, what their background is, and what is an appropriate level of knowledge for them to possibly learn that day.  His slides are messy (black background, full of small text), and narrative hard to follow.

&#x200B;

Sometimes we are asked to give joint presentations to the same audience, or ""split time"" on a single talk. I have started to decline this requests, as I don't like trying to merge my talk with his.  This hurts me, as I truly love talking about my science. (I kinda feel bad about this.)

&#x200B;

How much ""authority"" do I have to give him unsolicited advice on his presentations? In the Spring, I worked with him for hours on getting him to clearly understand his audience and make adjustments to slides for 1 talk. I don't have the time or energy to do this for all talks. We were tasked with giving a joint presentation later this Spring which I am already not looking forward to.

Can a hiring manager or recuriter contact your adviser about how bad you interviewed?,"So, I have a really smart doctorate graduate student friend who recently had her first computer science interview for an internship in a long time. She doesn't interview well at all and wasn't able to answer things she would know. The recruiters asked for her adviser and now is freaking out about them contacting the adviser and losing her funding.

Need advice (concerning lab responsibility),"Hey all!

&#x200B;

Okay so, I'm a part of two labs at the moment (2nd year grad student) and I help run health assessments in one of them. Let's call this the secondary lab. I'm also the data manager on that project and the project lead is also a 2nd year graduate student. Everybody else on the project, besides PI, are either close to graduating undergrad or post-bacc. Enter, let's call her Susie. She's also a part of both labs, however she's a post-bacc who is interning for 20 hours a week. We have similar meeting schedules because our primary lab has regular lab meetings, journal clubs, etc. I spend more time in the lab than 20/week, obviously, because we run on a 9-5 office schedule. And, I'm here later than that regularly, as well.

&#x200B;

Circumstance: We need to enter in our availability for next month's assessments and I noticed that Susie checked that she was unavailable in the time periods that I know we have our journal club, and also the time we have our trainee meeting.

Petty: Our Journal clubs are not structured enough where we need to block that time off. If one of us is busy, we can often move it to another time. Also, the assessments can be ended early, so the time period that may involve our trainee meeting, she should be free for also.

Problem: I would note that I'm available during these times, but seeing how little Susie has available since she's not declaring availability in our mutually available times, I have a secondary-lab specific problem. If I say I'm available, more than likely me and the project lead would have to put more groundwork into these assessments and we've been trying to pass those responsibilities on to interns as it takes a lot of time out of our schedules and not really theirs. One intern has a set schedule whether she's in the lab or not and Susie has more freedom with her schedule to make up 3 hours that she'll be gone doing assessments per week. However, I love this lab and my PI. I don't want to say that I'm not available because Susie did and have this affect how much work will be put onto the leader and my PI, because that's even less fair.

&#x200B;

Advice: Am I just being bitchy/nosy or is this a valid concern? Susie has also been annoying tf out of me by non-stop talking and being non-stop ego-buffed by her advisor about a paper she's first authoring that she didn't write :/, but that's another reddit complaint post and I'm sure that annoyance has inspired this rant, as well. I'm positive that I can't let my lab down and say I'm unavailable. Do you think if I find a way to mention this within the group (not as a confrontation, more like ""this day isn't great for me because of our trainee meeting, but we can cut the time off early"" she'll get the hint via leadership? I certainly cannot afford to be gone multiple days a week for 3 hour periods at a time and the PI has an even more strict schedule, I know for sure this slowdown of data acquisition wouldn't be fair to her.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Should I call out an intern in my lab who's likely bullshitting about when she's free to help with our research project?

&#x200B;

Update to those who helped: I followed advice to only put what I was comfortable with and also included ""maybe"" dates that Susie Cakes did not. We got the schedule and I have 8 days out of March to her 4 :/. Which isn't horrible. The lead on the project has 7 days and the other intern has 6. I'm leading, but  not by far, could be worse.

As a result, I have not applied to any of them because I am hesitant to ask my professors who have taught me for less than 4 months for references. I’m pretty sure they don’t know my interests outside of their classroom and would likely say no if I asked.  Plus, I don’t want to ask them every single time I come across an interesting opportunity and want to ‘save’ their references for those critical opportunities.

How do you go about asking professors with whom you don’t have a super established relationship with for academic references? What is the general norm in the academic world in terms of how many times you can ask a professor for a reference?"
Getting a second Master's degree?,"I'm currently a grad student studying economics, my main focus being environmental economics. Ideally, I want a consulting job after I graduate in something related to climate change/sustainability however, I've also been entertaining the idea of either getting a second master's degree in environmental science or something related to sustainability. My question is do you think it's worth the time (studying more when I could just be working) and is it even necessary? "
Can I add students on Facebook after the semester is over?,"I am a TA for an undergrad course in Biology. A few of my students and I have become what I consider close friends. They’ve talked with me about hanging out after the semester is over. 

The students I want to friend are a few years older than me. Is this acceptable behavior? Would it come off as weird? They’re both graduating this semester so there isn’t a chance that I would have them as students again. "
"Got into grad school, trying to get a new job. Best course of action?","I plan to go part time and work full time. I have no idea how to tell employers this, or when to tell them in the interview process. Do I tell them just as I get an offer and risk it being rescinded? Before the offer? 

Point is, I just really dislike where I work now and I don’t know if I can stay for another 2-3 years while pursuing a degree. Plus, at another job, I would be able to use what I learn in class more probably."
opinion on Fellowship programs after graduating with a Masters?,"About to enter my final year of my Masters in Public Health for Health Management and Policy. I have no idea what my next step might look like but i’ve been interested in applying for fellowships within my field, but in particular health policy. Right now, I’m interning with a House Representative in my state and I am working on Health Financing bills. 

I have no idea what I want to do, so I thought a fellowship might be useful? Does anyone know the pros and cons of a fellowship? Any insight?

What is the purpose of post-doctoral work and is it necessary for every PhD?,"Good Morning,  

So I started my PhD in Microbiology last year, and I've been trying to wrap my head around what a Postdoc is. I get that they have completed their degree and are now training on a higher level of responsibility with their PI, but is this another requirement when it comes to the employment check list? I noticed that both PhD Grads and Postdocs don't have the Dr. title. Is that something given to people who have completed both? My long term plan is not to go into academia (Love to teach but would hate it as a job), is a Postdoc something that would boost my employment potential or is it a flat out requirement? Do people do Post-doctoral work at places other than universities?"
How do you make connections in grad school?,"I'm in a part time professional masters program, and I work full time.  I basically show up to campus, go to class, take my tests, go home and get my grades.  My motivation for the degree is career advancement, rather than academic, and already my classes have helped me immeasurably at work.  However, it recently occurred to me that I'm not doing anything ""extra"", like I did in undergrad, and I'm halfway through the program. Now, granted, given the fact that I work full time in the field I'm going to school for, I don't really feel like I need part time work experience or internships, but I just feel like it would be nice to have something to put on my resume when I'm done besides my final project and GPA. I also haven't really grown close with professors who could be a reference for me. 


The problem is that the classes are huge, it's difficult to be able to talk to the professors before and after class, I live far away and classes get out late when I have work early the next morning, so I don't like to hang around after class, and they hardly respond to emails. In addition, because I work during normal business hours, it's tough to attend department events, though that is something I'm going to see if I can work into my schedule somehow. But even when I attended those events in undergrad, it didn't really help me connect with professors. It seemed like there the department size was smaller and everyone was working on the same degree, so it was easy to help a professor with research.  My grad school is much larger and more impersonal, and I'm kind of the low man on the totem pole, below PhDs and full time masters students. 


So what do you guys think? Any ideas or advice on how to get a bit more involved? Is it even necessary for me to get involved to advance? Thanks!"
Can doing a postdoc hurt my chances of getting a job in industry?,"I'm nearing the end of my Physics PhD and I'm trying to determine if a postdoc position would be helpful/detrimental to finding a job in industry. I'm not currently interested in pursuing a career in academia, but I've heard research scientist positions in industry/private sector can be just as competitive as faculty positions, and I'm wondering if it would be helpful to complete a postdoc.  


If I'm not successful in getting a research based position with my expertise and would need to job-hunt with a more general scope of the private sector, could the postdoc hurt my chances of being hired? I've heard stories of liability/preference within companies that dissuade them from hiring people with postdocs over Masters and PhDs based on salaries and things of the sort.

"Stuck in grad school for another month, how to approach job search?","I'm studying data visualization / web development / design in grad school.

I've been applying to them since January with limited results: most don't get back to me. I've had a couple of successful referrals, but they both needed me to start right away, which I could not do, so they told me to reach back out after I was done.

Because I've been so busy, I really haven't been able to give the job search my due diligence. I'm interested in moving to another city and exploring a variety of opportunities, but school has just been too much, and I can't commit right now. Recently, another job referral popped up, but I'm afraid it will be like other two, in that they'd want me to start right away (as soon as I graduate) and I wouldn't have time to interview other places.

Should I just wait until I graduate and then commit to giving the job search my best effort for a few months? I don't have to worry about rent until September. I just kick myself every time a cool job pops up, and feel guilty about not applying, like it could be a missed opportunity. However, I know that I want to look around before accepting the first thing that pops up. I've been in school for two years and the job search is so important to me, but it's not something I've been able to invest in fully."
should I do a masters right after graduation or work for a couple of years first?,"Hello all,

salary negotiations at non-academic job interviews,"The short version of my question is, does anyone have experience negotiating salaries after working as a graduate research assistant, and will I be laughed out of the room for trying to convince them that the amount of my tuition waiver should be considered part of my salary?  I was required to submit my salary history with my application, and I told them my compensation included a tuition waiver.  

&#x200B;

For context:

Pay range for the job is about $44,000 - $81,000

My pay for the last three years (for a university fellowship) has been $25,000 plus a tuition waiver that (at least on paper) is worth $45,000 per year

So, without the tuition waiver, the lowest pay for this new position is nearly double my current stipend, but including the waiver means I currently get paid about $70,000 per year.  

I'm considering asking for $70,000 to match my current ""pay"", but I'd really be pretty happy with anything above $60,000.

The job seems to require a lot of data analysis and presentation, but it's for the state government, so pay is low.

"My professor is terrible, I have no support from my school, and after finishing everything but my thesis I'm tempted to walk away.","Hello all,

I’ve been debating posting on different subreddits for probably the last 2 years, but I’m a bit timid on social media and haven’t felt like it. However I am truly struggling with dealing with the stress of grad school and a major professor that I feel has overstepped his bounds. For a little background I am in my last few months of my master’s degree in engineering. At this point all I have to do is finish up my thesis. I have defended and while I passed the oral defense, my thesis needs some work.

For further background I have been working on my degree for 2.5 years now. The first year of my degree I was being paid but I turned down further payment because working with my professor is so distressing that I would rather go into debt than let him continue to manipulate me. Over the year I worked for him he continually threatened to take away my funding if I wasn’t available at any time he wanted. I mean I’d wake up to emails sent at 1 am telling me that if I didn’t respond he’d kick out of the program. I got to a point that when I’d hear my phone email notification go off that I’d break out in tears. He’s called me names (manic, a witch, schizophrenic). He has insulted my relationship and family (called my long term SO worthless and if he was my father he’d have some serious concerns about me dating the person I am). For context my SO is very caring and basically cooks for me every night since I don’t have time to make my own food. My professor has also lied to me about requirements on my degree causing me to waste 800 dollars on worthless credits. One time I tried to bring up to him how stressed I was and how I wasn’t managing the work load and he told me “This is good, mental breakdown is up here, and I need you right, here just below it.” While motioning with his hands at the levels of stress and the “correct” amount of stress being just scraping the mental breakdown line.

I have tried to bring issues up with student services and the office of graduate studies but I have received no help. I have talked to other teachers in my department (he is the department head), and have received no help. I have been told I can either bow down to his wishes or drop.

I’m not a terrible student. I might not be the best, but I am certainly not even the worse out of his students. I am the major author on a published paper and my research has received praise from many other teachers and students. I know part of the problem is I took an internship last summer and have remained there working part time. Half the reason I took it was I needed a break from the grad school mania. My professor doesn’t like this because it means that I have less time for him, but I love my job. They want me to work there full time when I graduate or potentially work at our sister site on the other side of the nation. Also I have only been in 3 credits since last spring so working part time hasn’t really taken me away from required work at school. And my professor did approve the position before I accepted it.

I am at a loss of what to do. Even with my defense last week he hadn’t read my thesis (I gave the first draft to him over a month and a half ago). He’ll flip through a few pages, see that I don’t have a schematic he wanted in the introduction, and hand it back as ‘unacceptable’. It’s a 100 page document, I think it takes a little more time than 2 minutes to evaluate. He has told me that he wants my introduction to be part of a literature review that he can publish once I am gone so even if it’s not applicable to my research he wants certain things in it. He has certain visions for graphics that I’ve tried my best to create, but they are what he wanted so he’ll hand it back. These graphics aren’t even applicable to my research half the time.

I’m just so tired. I have threatened to drop in the past, which is when I took those extra credits. The credits were for a plan B so that I wouldn’t have to do a thesis just a report. When I later asked him about things he told me that the credits ‘were just a placebo to make you feel better’. I have no help from my school and I’m so tempted to just walk away. Any advice would be great, though just writing things down has been helpful in venting.

TLDR: My professor is an ass, he has lied to me, and I have no help from my school. I really want to graduate (only have to get my thesis done), but I am also really tempted to just walk away.

"Can you work outside your bachelor's field, then return to the field for grad school?","Hi everyone, my situation is a little weird.  I recently graduated undergrad as an engineer (semiconductor-related) and had an entry-level job in the industry.  However, I was included in a round of layoffs just months into the job (possible over-hiring, maybe bad management, etc.)  I have been looking to continue looking for work in the industry, but with little luck.  I have an opportunity for an outside sales position that I am seriously considering, albeit simply to be able to stay in my new apartment and avoid moving back home.  

My question is pretty simple: is it possible to reenter grad school in an engineering after 1-2 years even without working in a relevant field for those 2 years?  If so, is it advisable?

"New PhD graduate, starting over...with unpaid internship?","Hi,

Long time lurker finally finding the guts to tell my story. 

As of this weekend, I will have a PhD in Linguistics. I'm not going into academia, but I have an adjust gig lined up at a local community college for the next academic year.

I want out of teaching after that, so I've been looking at academic publishing. The university press in my city says they are happy to take as an intern, but it's unpaid. They said that they've had PhD interns before, and even their admin assistant has a PhD...my friend who's an acquisitions editor said this is true at their press as well. 

Between the adjuncting and my savings from a car accident settlement, and living with my boyfriend, I can technically *afford* an unpaid gig for 10 hours a week...but I'm wondering if it will look ridiculous on my resume to have an unpaid position at my level and my age (36)? Would you take this position, or would you find another way into an industry?

How do I tell my current supervisor?,"Alright, I’m currently a grad assistant with conferences at my school. Conferences is a pretty big program within Housing and yet, it’s literally composed of my supervisor, who is the Assistant Director, and 2 under grad students, and me until the summer begins and we hire the conference assistants. 

This is my first semester in grad school, educational counseling program. A speaker came to my class and advertised an immediate position with the Counseling and Psychological Services department called Community Mental Health Coordinator who would work with her to push an initiative on suicide awareness and train 10k students. The speaker got the grant for this 2-2.5 year position that pays $18/hour for 20 hours a week, she also offered being the mentor of the person offered the role. 

My current supervisor and I have planned the whole semester of how to recruit for summer and we’re currently interview interns, but this assistant position is not direct experience. It pays less and I work less hours. 

The thing is, if I get this job, my supervisor will be left by herself to do everything.

I’m going to apply for the new job because nothing is certain until I’m offered the role. I did my undergrad here and have experience/skills.

What's your preferred way of explaining the outline of your paper in the text?,"Revising a paper and the moment, so naturally I'm more interested in being on this sub than actually doing work :)

I've been thinking about the best ways of ""telling them what you're going to tell them, and then telling them, and then telling them what you told them.""  I like when papers give me an outline of what they're going to argue, and I feel that the most natural and clear way of doing this is by using ""we""--for example, something like ""We will begin by explaining research relating to A and B, and then will argue that because A and B, C.""  My advisor HATES that format and always changes it to something about ""the present study"" or ""the present paper"" or something, such as ""The present study argues that A and B, therefore C.""  And I think in high school, my teachers told me not to use first person or refer to the paper (which I blame for my current bad habit of using passive voice in basically every other sentence).

The job prospects for arts Ph.D graduates are not great. My bf doesn't think it's worth it,"The Bleak Job Landscape of Adjunctopia for Ph.D.s https://nyti.ms/39usdYk

I'm graduating undergrad soon, and plan to take a year or two off then go to grad school for my masters and PhD in History. I want to work in museums. I'd love to be considered an expert in my field. But apparently the job market is quite bad right now and will likely get worse. He was saying it's just throwing away thousands of dollars to end up with the same job you'd get with a BA maybe and MA.

UCSC Graduate Students are on WILDCAT Grading Strike!!!,"Hi all (mods, I hope you understand how this is a relevant posting on this subreddit),

I’m leaving this here because it’s something that affects all grad students to some extent. Currently, UCSC graduate students are enduring precarious conditions as we are living in one of the roughest housing economies in the nation- the majority of us are forced to pay 50% or more of our TA incomes towards rent alone (likely more if living in campus graduate student housing). We are currently on an unsanctioned WILDCAT GRADING STRIKE in order obtain a necessary Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). We need this COLA in order to get out from underneath the rent burden so many of us are facing. 

We need support and solidarity  from anywhere and everywhere we can get it! Please visit https://payusmoreucsc.com  or @payusmoreucsc on Instagram for more information on our COLA campaign!!

Any other confused NDSEG fellows out there?,"I was awarded with an NDSEG in April, and I’ve been fairly disappointed with how STI-Tech was managing the awards. I’m in the process of transferring schools, and I’m not even sure if my tuition payment will be sent to the correct school, as the fall semester is right around the corner.

Then today, they sent out an email explaining that STI-Tech is now no longer managing NDSEG fellows, but another company (Systems Plus, INC) is in charge. I sent an email their way, but have yet to hear from them. Like I said, the semester starts in under a month and the timing couldn’t be worse for me.

Are there any NDSEG veterans that know what’s going on here, or at least can provide some helpful advice?"
Support group for PhD students that are struggling,"Check update 3!

-> The link is in the end of the post <- 

Hey everyone,

I am a PhD student myself and struggling. Many many things are making me worried regarding my academic life. I thought about creating a support group for all of us in a similar situation. I thought about creating a discord server which, for those who don't know, is an app in the form of a chat/forum where you talk and can keep your anonymity, hence making you feel safe to share your personal struggles. I am also open to other suggestions like other apps. If you are interested send me a pm and we will start from there!

Update: I sent you the link via the reddit chat! Please check it out.

Update 2: Since I am receiving so many replies and chat messages, I will share here the link [https://discord.gg/egNNNY](https://discord.gg/egNNNY)

My dad doesn't believe me when I say I'm expected to be on-campus for research in the Fall even if classes are online (I'm starting a PhD at Texas A&M).,"He's supporting me a little bit financially but he doesn't want me ""to be the only one on campus"" even if it's for doing research for my assistantship so that I can get paid. His reasoning has to do with paying for an apartment (he's helping me out just a little bit to help lessen the burden of getting a very secure apartment so he doesn't have to worry). My dad doesn't believe me to the point where he says he's going to call the Office of Research to see what's up (I don't know if FERPA comes into play with that because research is different from person to person).

I already know I have to show up in person to start the onboarding process (which I have told him multiple times), and I asked my graduate advisor (not faculty advisor) about it and am waiting for her response. I just don't know what to do about this. My research isn't considered essential and doesn't have to do with living organisms. Could someone please give advice or input on this?

UPDATE: He apparently told my sister and not me (she's way older if that gives insight) that he's not actually going to call them. Yay for scare tactics. He has a past of being controlling like this.

UPDATE 2: He got mad at me for making a smart Alec comment, which I admit was wrong. It escalated to where I told him how messed up it is he would threaten something like calling my school. It hit the point where he said, “I won’t lose sleep if you never talk to me again” after I told him he was at risk of losing me as his daughter. I might end up posting this to another reddit because I honestly don’t know what to do now."
"So I’ve been working on my Masters for close to 3 years. The experiments took FOREVER, not to mention writing the thesis! However, my defense is finally in two weeks!!! YESSS. Has anyone else’s Masters taken as long as mine?","I’ve been doing a Bachelor’s/Masters contiguous program for the past 3 years, and I’m finally nearing the finish line. A combination of laborious work, med school apps, procrastination and very hard “senioritis” made this drag on longer than it should have. Has anyone else had a Masters program that just draaaagged on? I always felt I was doing something wrong by taking so long to complete it. People around me always seemed to graduate within 2 years. For a while, it felt I was never going to actually get the degree. My defense will feel surreal...

Edit: Thank you all for such reassuring comments! It definitely makes me feel alot better :)"
Is it in an advisors best interest to graduate a PhD student?,"If you're a PhD student, you are cheap labor for your advisor. Is it in your advisor's best interest to graduate you? Is there a rule in some university's code that requires you to be able to graduate after you've published X number of times? What is stopping your advisor from keeping you indefinitely? No official source, but I've heard MIT is notorious for keeping students around for long. True?

From another perspective, it is not in the profs best interest to keep you for too long because he/she wants to maintain his/her reputation as someone who chugs out graduate students at a healthy rate? A large grad student count also is a boost in reputation. 

Does the latter scenario seem more likely to happen to happen than the prior?"
"Does anyone else despise editing manuscripts and responding to peer review, or is it just me? Tips for making it less painful?","I like writing. I always have. I've written three manuscripts, and I've actually quite enjoyed the process for each one of them. But something I've learned is that I just totally hate what comes between completing the draft and seeing it in print. Every time for each of the three papers, it's looked something like this:  


First there were the numerous emails sent to co-authors over the weeks prior, begging for at the very least a response to my email giving their consent to submit, much less feedback on the manuscript.   


For the few that did provide feedback, there was the painstaking process of incorporating their comments when they directly disagreed with/contradicted each other.   


Then there's the teeth pulling-like process of making sure every minuscule t is crossed and i is dotted in the exact specific way outlined in the numerous pages of the journal's style guide. Level 1: centered and all capitals. Level 2: Freestanding flush-left boldface. Level 3: Paragraph-initiating boldface. Use et al in the literature cited for more than five authors. Add ""a"" and ""b"" to citations for works published by the same first-author in the same year. Kill me now....   


Then there's the re-reading the 70+ page document ten more times looking for mistakes, only to spend several more hours shoving the files through the journal's clunky submission portal and having to re-upload the thing another ten times when I find some other teeny tiny bit of something that needs tweaking while checking the rendered PDF.   


Each time I was finally able to hit that ""Submit"" button, I've had this overwhelming feeling of just wanting to be D.O.N.E. To never see that document again and be able to MOVE ON WITH LIFE.    


There's that brief period when it's going through peer review when I'm blissfully ignorant about all the ways in which my godforsaken manuscript is being ripped to shreds. All of the hairs that the reviewers are going to split about things that more often than not do not matter. All of the countless hours I'll have to pour into crafting pages and pages of verbiage arguing about the tiniest hills reviewer 2 has elected to die on. Repeating entire analyses that take weeks to run on the beefiest servers available just because some reviewer didn't like the way one of the fifty variables was calculated.   


Does this get easier? Or at the very least, does it ever start to not feel like individually plucking out leg hairs? Do other people enjoy this and maybe this career path just isn't the right fit for me? Anyone have words of wisdom or perhaps tips to make this feel less painful they'd be able to share?   


TLDR: I love writing up research, but editing manuscripts and responding to peer review makes me want to gouge my eyes out. Do other people feel this way? Will it ever become less painful, or is this not the right fit for me?"

Does anyone else get science FOMO?,"Okay, so this might just be me, but does anyone else feel like they are always missing out on amazing science? like whenever I think about specializing myself in a niche area, i feel like I will miss out on other stuff that's also super interesting. I am a biochemist, but sometimes I can't help but feel like there is so much more to both biology and chemistry (and even physics sometimes) that I will never be able to truly satisfy my curiosity. I just feel like there is soooo much interesting scientific research going on and soo little time to learn about it all :/ Does anyone else feel this way? how do reconcile this feeling with dreams of obtaining a phD?"
My friend tried to scoop me :(,"This is really really not supposed to be a humble brag, but I have a research idea that is SO exciting and novel to me. My advisors are genuinely pumped and one even said, “this could be career breaking”.

I know I’m WAY ahead of myself and everything could crash and burn, but I was so freaking amped I talked to a confidant and my closest friend in the program. This was about a month ago and I was basically gushing about the line of research I wanted to start. Probably annoying lol but I couldn’t contain my excitement and she’s in my field and knew she would understand what I was talking about. 

Apparently she talked to my advisor about a very similar idea this weekend. He then emailed the both of us and basically said I had that exact idea - I think to call her out and to also help me stake my claim on the idea. I offered in the email back to everyone to meet and bounce ideas off each other but I’m so angry. I really thought she had my back. She completely posed the idea as her own. It would have been different if she had reached out and said she wanted to collaborate.

I’m so fortunate my advisor stuck up for me. I don’t know if or how I should talk to my “friend” about this. As of now, I have replied to the email confirming it was my idea and left the door open for collaboration just to be nice. 

What should I do? Should I speak directly to this person who posed the idea as her own? Let it go and use it as motivation to get my projects started? Speak to my advisor privately? 

Sorry I’m just completely blindsided about how blatant the stealing was."
What is a free alternative for Adobe Acrobat Reader DC?,"Hello everyone! You all were so helpful in recommending a free program for tracking my citations (Zotero), so I am coming to you again looking for another free resource. I've been using (and paying for) Adobe Acrobat Reader Pro DC to comment, highlight, and create bookmarks for TONS of PDF documents that I use for my graduate studies. However, looking at my bank account... It just doesn't seem worth $15 each month. It really adds up. I am wondering if folks have a free alternative? I'd like something with the Acrobat perks (like the ability to edit) but I also know beggars can't be choosers!"
"Uni puts its full-time, permanent staff on leave while ""encouraging"" students & post-docs to ""volunteer"" in their place","I'm not entirely sure why I'm sharing this, but I guess I would like to know if I'm being completely unreasonable or what. So today it was announced that all staff in our various animal research centres have been put on leave, which means that showing up to work is pretty much voluntary for them from now on. To fill this ""gap"", the university is encouraging its students and postdocs to ""volunteer"" for essential technician work like cleaning cages, replacing food / water, and daily animal monitoring. Of course, it was made very clear that if people don't ""volunteer"" they would have no choice but to terminate all on-going experiments. At the risk of sounding like a douche, I really didn't sign up for a Phd to clean mouse cages and weigh out food pellets. So to my PI's dismay, I would rather leave my on-going studies for the next student, allowing me to focus on writing papers with the data I already have. It's also beyond me why my health and safety should be worth any less than that of technicians with reasonably secure permanent positions at ~2x my salary...
My initial gut reaction to this news was just anger. Anger at the university screwing over its research staff once again, because they know we'll do whatever it takes anyways."

"Dissertation Writing Tips! + Please add to this, since I wrote this mainly for my self-reference. Hopefully we can help each other this way.","1. Keep a note of the mark scheme. This is so you're actually working towards what you are expected to achieve. 

2. Plan out the sections you plan to have in the dissertation at the beginning. 

3. I had to choose my dissertation topic from a list so I don't have tips on actually choosing a topic. But to narrow down the topic you have decided on, look for specific keywords in websites such as sciencedirect or google scholar. Look for ""Review Articles"" instead of ""Research Articles"" at first since review articles basically 'review' everything already known about the topic you were looking for. It's more efficient to read through those initially rather than go through 800 research article search results. Once you finish reading through those, look at primary articles linked to those review articles that you are interested in. Then you'll get ideas of a niche in the topic of your interest since they usually mention future scope and developments for the topic at the end of those articles.

4.Take notes! When taking notes, keep a word document where you note down the article and reference of where you're taking notes from. Keep it concise and try your best to write in your own words so you wont get plagiarism when you write the info for your own literature review in the disseration. Colourcode them so they're organized!

5 . Make use of apps that make your workflow more efficient. 
My suggestions at the moment:

>Referencing software such as Mendeley, Endnote, Zotero. Many people suggested Zotero to me, and I'm loving it so far. Especially the browser extension.

>Note taking software: Notion is an amazing app for it! So many benefits. This video got me into it. It's free for personal use so definitely take advantage of this and use it guys. 
https://youtu.be/ONG26-2mIHU

>LaTeX. Many people suggested me to use this instead of Microsoft Word to make my dissertation look much better but honestly I'm struggling to figure out how to use it. There's definitely a learning curve with this that I intend to tackle. 

6 . Most important of all, when you take your own notes- make sure to write your own ideas and thoughts about each thing you take down. This is key to write a good dissertation."
I literally have the best PI!,Past couple of days I’ve had to make some tough decisions. Finally made one but I was nervous that my PI won’t approve but he totally did!

"Looking for a free transcribing software, any suggestions?",Like the title says I am doing a qualitative research project for my Masters thesis and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on good transcribing software that’s free or relatively inexpensive.
Can anybody enlighten me what Reviewer 1 really wants me to do? Lol,"This is an interesting and creditable effort by the authors and has some interesting aspects. The main challenge for those familiar with the field will be that it appears to have been carried out without any awareness of the literature. Cationic particle toxicity has been discussed at length, also mechanistically, and all mom that is unknown to the authors, as is the role of the dispersing medium. This means the work is an interesting mixture of new efforts by the authors that are sometimes not interpreted I the light of the literature. This all leads to quite an odd outcome for the informed reader. Quite good work often, with a complete lack of awareness of the literature. 

It is hard therefore to know how to judge the paper. It is certainly a pity to lose its input entirely, but hard to know how to react."
How much are PIs supposed to help?,"I got into a PhD program two months ago. Since then I've been talking to my PI since I was in the lab as an undergrad a while ago. She thought it might be a good idea to join in on their weekly meetings to get a sense of what they're doing right now and be involved. I joined in last week and I'm so lost. I know it's just for me to see how they operate but even seeing the undergrads do more than me and be more involved scared me. Will things get better once the fall term and my program as a PhD student officially starts? Will my PI then start helping me out more and directly involving me in the projects? For now I'm really discouraged and I have a major feeling of imposter syndrome being so lost in the lab. I'm doing the readings my PI is talking about and trying my best to understand what they're doing right now but obviously I don't know the details of their proposed study so I can't do much. Also the fact that everything is online right now is not helping.

So I wanted to ask, how much is a PI supposed to help you? Is mine not that involved with me right now because it's the summer and my program hasn't officially started yet?"
Advice for learning python for grad school?,"I'm an incoming phd student and wanted to spend my free time this summer doing some lowkey prep before the fall. One of the things I've heard is helpful is learning python (rn i've most only used matlab). Was wondering if anyone had recs/tips/ways to approach learning python? I have basic coding experience, and I expect I'll mostly be using python for various data analysis, nothing too crazy (measuring and characterizing devices and materials I fabricate). I was thinking of using simple free online crash courses to learn the syntax, but if anyone has ideas for practicing in a way that's relevant to my basic needs in research, I'm all ears!"
"My M.S. Advisor let me Defend When I wasn't Ready, and I Failed","tl;dr. Lost funding; threw a hail-mary to defend before funding ran out; failed. Still don't think I should've been allowed to defend. 

So a bit of background: my relationship with my advisor sucks. He convinced me to switch projects from one with a working code to one with a broken code without telling me the code was broken. So, instead of generating results and trying to develop a new method, I tried to debug thousands of lines of C++ CFD code, unsuccessfully, for about 7 months.

After failing to fix his code, he informed me in my third semester that he was hesitant to keep funding me, and that I would need to improve my work ethic. I think the debugging with no results had burned me out completely at this point.

Finally, I propose a new approach to fixing his code that he still doesn't particularly like, and yet it answered some important questions on how to move forward. 

He informs me that he cannot fund me past two years. Okay, fine. I'll try to defend before that.

He informs me halfway through the Spring semester that I should defend in May. Great! Hopefully I can get it done in time; if not, I'll have to pay my own tuition to defend.

Well, the deadline comes up and he tells me a ""sensible"" draft of my thesis should be fine. We meet remotely for the defense, and I fail.

I totally get that I'm responsible for this chain of events, but damn did I get very little practical guidance in how to proceed. This has been the worst experience of my life, and I want to give up after working so hard on a thesis, then flunking the defense. I just don't understand how an advisor with my best interest at heart would let me defend and fail.

Now I must wait at least 3 months to defend again, so a summer defense is not an option. It's looking like another semester or two to finish my degree."

Research is getting restricted into just simulations with not much mathematical analysis being done.,"As the title says, my work has lots to do with simulating wireless networks and then coming up with better schemes for wireless communication among them.

Industry collaborations during PhD -- What am getting myself into?,"A former mentor of mine is now working in a biotech startup in the same city I am doing my PhD in. I did one of my rotations there and really like the cutting-edge work they are doing, and have been invited to continue working with them for part of my dissertation work. One of the founders of the startup is a professor at my institution (and a very big name in the field) and would serve as a pro forma co-advisor and/or committee member.

I am not sure if my department administration will let me do this anyway, but before I even ask I just want to do a sanity check to see if this is something I necessarily want. In particular, I'm worried about:

1. Security of funding -- if the startup does not pay me and the work I do for them will contribute to my dissertation, will my fellowship funding be safe despite restrictions on ""outside work""? In particular, I'm currently on an NIH T32, have NSF GRFP on reserve, and hope to get an NIH F31 and/or F99 in the future.
2. Managing the collaboration -- I've generally been advised that it's not a good situation as a PhD student to be the ""glue"" of a collaboration. While my advisor has indicated interest in the topic and would be happy to advise me on the work I do with the startup in addition to what we're already working on, should I expect the typical drawbacks of ""gluing"" a collaboration?
3. Career prospects -- I am very firmly hoping to land a tenure-track academic position in the long run, but obviously understand that it would help to have industry relationships to fall back on. That said, will future academic hiring committees be concerned about or even look down on these kinds of industry collaborations as long as I still publish my work in academic journals?

If you've done industry collaborations during your PhD, what was your experience like?"

How do you choose the right way to frame the story of your paper?,"In my field of research, there are usually many different ways to tell the story of your experimental findings, which ends up moving the work in a direction where you do even more experiments in an attempt to validate your conclusions, and so on. I think of it as an intersection in my project, and depending on the turn I make next, the whole story gets a different shape. Additionally, every conference venue has its own flavor, so to say: some prefer theoretical rather than applied work, some are skeptical of new tasks while others are receptive. How do you decide which direction to go with your paper, and how to frame your research story?"
"Every time more senior collaborator doesn't like the results, it's my fault","I'm stuck working on this one project with a collaborator who used to be a good friend but turned sour after graduating PhD, moving to another institution, and being promoted to assistant research professor the year after postdoc. 

A situation that occurs quite often is, I'd have some concerns about the quality of our results and the assumptions of our approach, he would ignore them or explain them away, I'd run the evaluation on our results, and he would be unhappy if he doesn't see the trends he expects. 

He would sometimes reiterate to me the claims he wants to make in a paper, as if I can magically snap my fingers and make the model behave a certain way. He seems very rigid to feedback or exposing gaping holes in the methodology, and harbors this irrational attachment to every idea of his while explaining all the faults of the method with decisions I made instead. 

It makes me very anxious to interact with someone who thinks I'm such a failure, and he's not even my advisor, so I don't have to answer to him. He's just a former friend with whom I'm stuck interacting while this work turns into an accepted publication. I used to hold out hope that we could restore our friendship but I don't see that happening given he's treated me like this for two years, sometimes publicly shaming me in front of both of our professors in email form when he was extra upset.

Right now, we got our reviews back from a resubmission of this paper to a different conference and they're overall positive except for one comment. I provided the extra evaluation necessary, and now he is unhappy that the numbers don't corroborate the reviewer's complaint more conclusively. He is essentially telling me what I should have done in the past, how I should have done it, and why what I did doesn't matter when he had every opportunity to give feedback and ideas in the past when I closely shared updates with him.

This year I'm much less affected by him but the two years prior, I was having a very difficult time wrapping my head around the fact that a good friend became someone who thinks so little of me. I've gotten threats of my project being taken over by him if he doesn't see certain types of action, I've been told he will contact my advisor directly if I don't respond to his requests, I've gotten authorship threats (implying I could be shifted to the back or omitted from author list altogether). It was incredibly toxic especially since I was in the middle of my PhD, hadn't published that much yet, and was still looking at him as a mentor.

How do you all deal with people like that?"

How do I stop the gut-reaction when I see philosopher's names?,"When I read certain academic works, I always end up getting really frustrated or irritated with the constant invocation of philosophers like Foucalt, Sartre, etc. I don't believe there's necessarily anything *wrong* with using these philosophers in academic writing and reading, but what are some things that I can do to better understand *why* people use these ideas in their writing?   


At the moment I'm more inclined to just go ""shut the fuck up"" in my head rather than try to be open about the  kinds of ideas that the writers (especially during peer reveiw) are invoking. At the moment it just feels like I'm reading a bunch of bullshit rather than something that would supplement my understanding of an article or book."
Question - Correlate two scales - 1 has its maximum at 7 (1-7) and 1 at 4 (1-4-7) - need help," Hello,

i would like to correlato two scales. One of them is a likert scale that goes from 1 to 7 where 7 is the max and 1 is the least. The 2nd measures inequity in a relationships. It also goes from 1 to 7 but is scored differently. 1 is the least (inequity cause Person A does way more than B), 4 is the maximum (relationship is balanced) and 7 is the least again (inequity cause Person B does way more than A).

How should/can i correlate those two?

One option would be to recode the 2nd scale from (5=3) (6=2) (7=1) so it would go from 1 to 4 and 4 is the max, z scale both scales and correlate them

but are there other ways to do so? or maybe more efficient ways?

thank you very much!"
Successful defense!,"I had my MS thesis defense yesterday (on Zoom, of course), and I'm proud to say that I passed! I have some revisions to make on my thesis manuscript, but overall the defense-- and specifically, the questions asked of me both by the audience and my committee-- weren't nearly as bad as I thought they would be. As a geology student, I think I can safely say that, with all that's gone on research-wise in the last two years, the experience of doing a Master's degree rocked."

The Good PI,"I keep seeing stories about bad PI's and people asking advice on what to do because they wound up with a toxic PI.


I just wanted to share some light to the good PI's. So, if you have a good PI, please share why they're good, how you knew they were good/met them, and any stories about times they've been good or went above and beyond for you. 


I'll start. (I'm a MS student if that helps)


I met a PhD candidate whos research I found interesting. We discussed how I could add to it and the PI they work with. They helped me get on that PIs radar. I met with them and we were all on the same page on how I can contribute and do my own thesis.


The PI and I have weekly meetings on my progress and next steps. At first I was getting discouraged because we'd always have bits in the meetings that were along the lines of ""Why did you do it this way? Thats incorrect."" Or ""Why is the focus on this? Try this instead."" But he ALWAYS pointed me in the right direction and answered all my questions respectfully and in detail. He also listens to my ideas and has generally accepted them. Even though I do my own research for application of methods, I always learn something new in our meetings.


Now that I'm more in tune with how he does things and how the project works, the bits of meetings that discouraged me are almost nonexistent. Now he always ends the meetings with something along the lines of ""This is great work Gerbaily. Great job this week. I can tell you put in a lot of work and we are progressing quickly. Keep it up."" He's awesome and I always feel proud after our meetings. It keeps me motivated to continuously do work and do just a *little* more before our next meeting. I'd hate to let him down!


And thats my story of my awesome PI. What's yours?"
Deciding on a Thesis Topic?,"I’m an incoming senior (English major) in college, and I’m really struggling in regard to finding a thesis topic. How do you decide what to research/focus on?"
"PSA: If you're using ScholarOne, the revision deadline expiration ""due on [date]"" means you have to submit it before that date","So maybe I'm stupid but seems like others have experienced the same situation as me (source [1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-am-coping-screwing-up-present-tense-diptiman-banerji/), [2](https://scholaronemanuscripts.ideas.aha.io/ideas/S1MI-I-670)). FYI this is my first time ever submitting a manuscript so hopefully next time I'll be more prepared and submit earlier. Hope this can be a warning to those who are using or will use ScholarOne.

I was given a revision submission deadline 'Due on \[date\]' on ScholarOne. I thought I had by the end of that date to hit the submission button. The night before I was all prepped and ready - all my documents were uploaded and I was just waiting to see if anything urgent from the other co-authors would prop up regarding acknowledgments or funding statements. The next day I came back to it and nope, the revision deadline had expired. Fortunately, it seems to be a common occurrence as the editorial board's page had a statement that said they could extend the deadline for submission that had already expired. I've emailed them and awaiting for a reply. Unfortunately it's the weekend so it might take another week for them to get back.

Also, they don't put a timezone on so I have no clue when it's going to expire. This seems like a huge oversight. I'm not sure what other submission systems are like but I hope they're better than this. Also it looks like the issue has been around for a while... it doesn't seem too hard of a problem to sort out after all these years right?"
"I can’t be the only one struggling to title my thesis, right??","I know this is a relatively mundane issue in the grand scheme of things but I dunno man. Just wondering how other people picked their titles. 

My thesis is mixed methods, and also interdisciplinary. I use topics in linguistics, psychology, sociology, public health and identity studies to inform my research. It’s split into two parts, one where I propose a theoretical framework, and a second where I conduct a study to address the first problem the framework recognizes as needing to be addressed. 

And none of the title I come up with feel like they’re good. Either they’re too long, too short, don’t emphasize linguistics enough, don’t emphasize my framework enough. Just a headache!! 

Please tell me I’m not alone."
Anyone still working on campus?,"We just got news that our university is closing for student workers today, but will be “flexible” until Friday. 

My PI seems to think that this means we should do as much as possible by Friday. I’m looking at a dozen 2 to 3 hour experiments to do by then. PI claims that funding situation is tight, with no room to budge or delay, so it must be done. “No mercy situation” PI says. “Stay safe, bye!” was the last thing PI said in our online meeting this morning. 

Moreover, PI applied for a special permit so that our group can continue to go to campus to perform experiments, as PI referred to them as so-called “critical operations”. Waiting to hear how that turns out. 

Stay safe, but also risk your health and possibly life by not staying at home for the sake of more research, because pressure from funding sources is a thing. What kind of dystopia is this?

At the same time, since campus will be closed, very few people will be there. It might just be a bit safer then. Right? 

Anyone else out there being treated like a robot during this crisis? Anyone still working on campus? I’m genuinely curious to know."

Struggling to pick a rotation lab; pls help,"tldr: I'm struggling to pick my first rotation lab. Reading papers doesn't really get me excited about the science since they're so dry. 

I'm an incoming chemistry PhD student, and I am really struggling to pick my first rotation lab. My program has a pretty long list of professors I can choose from, and I don't have very clear research interests, so I am struggling to narrow down my list of profs to reach out to. 

I wish I knew exactly what kind of research I wanted to do, but frankly it's all equally interesting and uninspiring at the same time. It's hard for me to get excited about research just from reading a paper. I prefer learning about science through talks and such. I'm the kind of person that will become interested in just about anything so long as it is presented well. I'm afraid that I'll overlook a great lab because I can only base my decision off of lab websites and papers.

It doesn't help that when I met with my first year advisor, I presented a list of about seven PIs that I was interested in (I made this list just from an initial gut reaction when reading the research summaries on their websites), and my advisor gave me names of another six PIs I should look into. So now I have this long list and I don't know how to narrow it down. Maybe I'm overthinking this decision since I'll have three rotations total, but I can't help but feel that I can't make an informed decision from the papers alone (since as I said before, they just don't do it for me in terms of getting me excited about the science).

I will also reach out to students who have rotated in these labs to ask about the lab environment. I'm struggling with the science aspect of this decision. 

Am I overthinking this? Should I just pick a few labs that seem interesting and not worry so much about missing out on other labs that might also be interesting to me but I don't know it? Any insight or advice would be much appreciated."

Horrible workplace/lab environment during COVID... is this treatment normal??? Help!!,"Hello all,

I work in a psychology/neuroscience research lab (have been there for about 3 years right now, 2 years full time 1 as an UG). I want to get my PhD in clinical psychology, planning on applying for it this cylce.

I fully understand what I have signed up for in this position- long hours, tough days, hard work, being at my PIs beck and call, etc. I don't have a problem with any of that, my team and I are dedicated to what we do and advancing our careers. However, since the COVID crisis has begun, the environment has changed in a dangerous way.

My lab is human research on cannabis, and because of the legal restrictions we have a pretty innovative research design that involves us running participants in a van. The nature of the study is running a baseline appointment at our office and then driving the van up to 50-90 minutes away to run the participant at their house so they can use the product. This appointment is a total of 3-4 hours in the van with 3 of us in very close quarters- two RAs and the participant. 

Naturally, running human subjects during this time causes a lot of anxiety. We are worried about our own safety and the safety of our participants. Our study presents a unique challenge/risk because of the design- if you are in a small enclosed enviroment with no windows with two other people for 3 hours and one of you is sick, all three of you will be sick by the end. Not to mention we are doing 3 seperate blood draws in the van, so even closer proximity/working with biohazardous materials. 

In March when this all first started, my PIs did not understand why we would be concerned about running appointments. They told us that we had nothing to worry about because we are young and would ""probably get it anyways"". My coworkers and I finally took a stand and they agreed to back down temporarily- luckily, the University closed operations that same day and all employees were sent to work from home.

During this work from home period, communication has been horrible (it's never great, but particulalry horrible during this period). Our bosses have made many comments downplaying the severity of this crisis/making us feel hysteric for being concerned (Note: our bosses have never once run a van appointment, it is a team of 3 of us for my projects that run everyone. A typical week they want to see is us in the van daily, running 1-2 van appts a day). These incidents are just the tip of the iceberg but overall we have been given no reason to believe that they are looking out for our best interests/health. 

A few days ago, we found that they want to send us back to work, as early as May 4th. It is unclear what this means but from their vague statements to us it seems like they want us to begin running participants ASAP- in the van as well. We don't know what kind of PPE we will be recieving, or what kind of protections will be in place. There will be no way to confirm if any of us or if any of our participants have the virus because we do not have the testing capactity. We are located in Colorado, where cases and deaths are still rising daily and we are nowhere near the testing capacity we need to be (testing has actually plateaud for the past month). Our governor (for some fucking reason) is easing social distancing restrictions/beginning to partially open the economy on Monday the 27th (even though he has acknowledged this is against public health reccommendations, we will probably see a spike in 3 weeks, and might have to go back to shleter in place). It seems like our bosses are running with this and trying to re-open operations despite the science saying we should move very very slowly. 

So far no one has asked us how we feel about this- we are hearing these plans from various sources, and being left in the dark. The people in charge of our ""safety"" plan are ones who don't run appointments/interact with participants. The risks of human research in this time seem high, but even higher for our study protocols. My coworkers and I are terrified it will get to a point of having to lose our jobs because we do not feel safe performing them. I feel like I am facing a choice between endangering my health or potentially derailing my career. I/my co-workers have put up with a lot of bullshit at this job and worked our asses off to get where we are, but we are not willing to risk our lives/well being just to collect 3 more data points??

Sorry this is so long but... my question really is- **is this normal????** If you work in a lab, how is your lab handling COVID? Is anyone else experiencing anything like this in their lab?? Is this treatment of employees normal/ok in anyway? 

**TLDR: I work with human participants in a close proximity w/ biohazardous materials and our bosses are trying to send us back on May 4th and have not listened to any of our concerns throughout this entire crisis.**"
"Those pursuing/intending to pursue a research career, how did you come to pick your niche?","As someone who has switched fields/interests twice in the last 3 years, and currently struggling to pick a thesis mentor, I'd like to know how/when you guys had the 'this-is-what-I-want-to-spend-my-life-researching' moment?

How do I get good at/comfortable with reading literature?,"Please be nice, I already feel kind of stupid about this.
I find reading literature to be incredibly intimidating. I took an advanced grad class when I wasn't an advanced grad and the whole class was basically reading and discussing papers. I was very, very inexperienced at that point. Everyone had really insightful points of discussion while I struggled at basic comprehension. And it made me feel really stupid and incredibly intimidated towards reading papers. 
That has carried on to now. I want to be up do date or remotely close to that in my field of work now, and I intend to use this work from home time to do that. 
However, instead of just sifting through it directionless, I wish to have a strategy.
Just wanted to know if you guys have tips regarding the same. Where to start, how to start, how you might have understood data you weren't able to interpret initially.
Also-hope everyone is taking care of themselves in these stressful times. I'm sending out good vibes, this sub is full of such hard workers! :)"

Writing advice for my WWI paper,"Right, so I'm writing a 15-page essay on tanks in WWI for my HIST 551 class. The topic is as follows: *How did the use of tanks adapt and change between the battles of the Somme, Cambrai, and Villers-Brettoneaux*?

So, I've got plenty of sources for each of these (courtesy of [archive.org](https://archive.org) and their massive collection of digitized books in these weird times). The issue is the writing.

Would PhD be a good idea for a person like me ?,"I'm just finishing my Master's degree (last semester) and wondering about my future prospects.
I have delved deep into the opportunities that stand my way due to my Life Sciences degree and am starting to feel lost.

It's just how risky getting into research is. You have mo surity of employment,  and may as well get stuck as a permadoc well into your 40s. That's more than 15 years of your life. Faculty positions are pretty hard to come by , that comes as no surprise. 

Imagine walking into your PhD with a star in your eye and you quickly realise that soon you would have to jump from one contract to another in order to make a living. Wasting away your youth engaged in gruelling work where u are not only underpaid , but also underappreciated. There's always the fear of not giving results or not receiving another contract.

I have heard countless stories of Postdoctoral candidates being extremely lonely and depressed. This would be a far from ideal situation for a person like me who often deals with anxiety and panic attacks. And the fact that I wont even have any family or close friends around to support me just scares me to the max. Depression would soon follow . And it just stops me from functioning all together .

I hope I have the correct picture of how academia is. Any advice and suggestions would not only be welcome , but also highly awaited ."
Going to completely fuck up my MSc thesis proposal and the relationship with my advisor,"I have to submit my MSc thesis proposal in a few days and it's going to be a DISASTER.

Simply put, I thought I only needed to submit a vague research topic that I would then develop more thoroughly while reviewing the literature and such.

Turns out, it has to be a detailed 6-pages proposal where I have to state my research objectives and questions, my method, the state of the art and some references that I will use. I wasn't really aware of this - I mean, I had the document but I wasn't aware of the level of detail I was required to get into. Part of it was poor communication, part was due to me procrastinating and being unmotivated to do anything due to this covid crap which has deeply affected my daily life (I live in a hard-hit area). 

This has also affected the relationship with my advisor, who has been SUPER nice so far - I was really trying to make a good impression on him but I utterly failed and now he thinks I'm a dumbfuck who cannot work like a goddamn adult (and rightly so). 

I am supposed to scramble this project together in less than 3 days, but I don't even have a clear topic in mind and I can't just submit whatever because my advisor wants to see it first and then I'll have to defend it in an online meeting with my committee who will question me about it.

These are crucial deadlines and if I don't meet them, I don't graduate.

My anxiety is through the roof and I cannot concentrate. I'm seriously thinking of giving up altogether because I don't see any possible way to get out of this mess. But giving up now would mean throwing 1.5 years of my life in the garbage and ending up without any academic title in a job market which couldn't possibly be shittier at the moment.

I ask you to please not attack me personally - I am already doing it myself. Do you have any advice on how to deal with this mess?"
Should I try to get my PI to change my project?,"Hi everyone. I'm a 4th year PhD student in biology and I'm having some issues with a project. When I first joined my lab, my PI gave me a really exciting project on a topic I felt comfortable with, aligned with my current interests and career track, and immediately got to it. Funds were low at the time, enough to support the research but not me, and I was TAing to support myself, which greatly reduced my time working on research. My PI somehow got a grant for a different project that he's not very familiar with (it's a pilot grant) and gave me this project to do concurrently with my main one. I have done so for about two years now and I've found that I am really not interested in the topic. I don't like the project, I don't like the people I have to work with on it, it doesn't align with my ideas for the future, and because it's a pilot grant in a new area for us, we are going in basically blindly with no collaborators. I was producing subpar data and have found no meaningful results so far.

As such, I was happy when it seemed like we were ditching the project because I'd be able to focus full time on my other one, but my PI is now wanting me to apply for a fellowship for the second project and is looking to apply for a full grant in it with a collaborator. I don't want to continue this project but I understand that having funds to support me and the lab might need to take priority. However, I'm very concerned that if we get the fellowship and/or grant, I will have to leave my first project completely for this second one and I know that this will make me unhappy. I'm also worried that given our negative data, it'll be very hard for me to publish good papers and graduate.

So my questions are: should I mention to my PI that I am not interested in this project? Do grad students in general have that amount of say in their research, specially when there's low funds? And if so, how should I go about this? I'm terrible at confrontation and don't want to sound like I'm simply dismissing the project because I know this is my job. Any input is appreciated!"
What is the best grad school to go to?,"I am not in college right now. I’ll be doing my second semester at CC over the summer and I am just curious.

Do people typically consider Ivy league and super selective schools for grad school even if they are not the usual person to be so high up? It is not that going to those schools make a person better than going to other grad schools.

What is your first choice of grad school for science, specifically physics or more preferably astrophysics?

What is something informative and interesting about grad school and what is you favorite part about it?

Thank you :)

update: I am considering graduate school at either a very selective school like UC Berkeley or Yale. is it so strange for someone to go from being a felon to a Yale graduate?"
Suggestions on Research and Citation Organization / Software?,"Friends in STEM Research

I am looking for citation / research organization software... or workflow suggestions.

I've run across Mendeley and Zotero. I've run across UpToDate (rip founder). I've recently been pointed to LaTex and BibTex. I've also run across a thorough explanation of excel spreadsheet based research organization through r/research.

I think what is most important to me is being able to refer to and track authors and subject matter. Also to be able to export the data as a citation page or just be able to export it to excel. 

I'm just curious what everyone's using? Any other recommendations? Why? What is most important to you and your workflow?

Joining a research lab without any experience in research?,"I'm finishing up my first semester in grad school, and I'm aiming for an MS in Computer Science. I'd like to take advantage of all that graduate school has to offer, and helping in academic research in either ML or cybersecurity is something I'd like to do. I've never had any research experience in undergrad, unfortunately and so I'm not confident in my prospects of getting accepted into a lab. Additionally I'm afraid that even if I am accepted, my lack of prior experience might hinder me. Should I try asking a professor, or just not bother trying? Is it too late for me, since my first semester is ending and I'd only have like a year to work with a lab?"

Awarded NDSEG - Advice about entering a new program for PhD? *Marine Science/STEM/US*,"I was just awarded the NDSEG, which will fully fund me for three years as a graduate student with a great stipend. For reference, I am a second year graduate student in a marine science program that I love. Before receiving this award, I had decided to defend my MS thesis and work for a few years before getting my PhD. I set a defense date and have been interviewing for Masters level jobs. My field is molecular microbiology and I study social interactions in bacteria, but I would be interested in focusing more on microscopy work and field-based ecological studies.

Since I was planning on doing a PhD at some point, I feel like the NDSEG fellowship is too good of an opportunity to pass up! I absolutely love my advisor and department, and if I were to stay in my current program I could finish my PhD in the three years that I now have funded. However....I don’t love the research I am doing. I have been in my lab for >5 years already (undergrad, lab manager, and now graduate student), and I’m just ready for something new. My background is in microscopy, bacterial genetics, and molecular microbiology. I would love to incorporate more microscopy into my work, and given that I am in marine sciences I am looking for more opportunities to do field work. 

So this leaves me with three options:

1. Decline the NDSEG and defend my MS, as I had originally planned. Given that I intended on doing a PhD at some point, I no longer feel like this is my best option.

2. Complete a PhD in my current program. Although I don’t love my current research projects, I have a fantastic relationship with my advisor and I can appreciate that this isn’t always the case in academia. I have also already completed my quals/classes/etc. so the rest of my time in this program would solely be doing research.

3. Defend my MS and enter a new program for my PhD. This would give me the opportunity to find a research project that I am really excited about, but I am concerned about the timeline. I only have until 4/29 to accept the NDSEG, and obviously I will not be able to travel to visit programs/advisors right now because of COVID. This is very short notice to find someone willing to accept a new graduate student, and I’m weary of joining a new lab without having met with my advisor in person.

Does anyone have advice about how to handle this situation? Obviously this is a really great problem to have, and I know that I will end up happy and in a successful career no matter which option I choose! Additionally, can anyone offer advice about how to approach potential advisors on short notice like this?"
What do you wish you took time to learn before undertaking a PhD? (psychology),"Hi guys, I will hopefully be starting a PhD in psychology around mid-July. Until then, I have casual work as a research assistant, but given the current situation I feel like I still have a lot of time on my hands and I want to make the most of it.


So my question is, what skills/programs/resources etc. do you suggest would be most beneficial for me to start learning and looking into now? I guess I'm looking for more practical examples such as programming as opposed to general skills like time management. 


Thanks! 
quick context: I'm based in Australia, so this program will not include any coursework, just the research thesis."
Is there a sub where I can post looking for bibliography help and recommendations for my Masters thesis?,"A lot of the books I was going to use are in a library that is now closed down for COVID-19 and I have no idea when I’ll have access to them again.

I feel a little bit overwhelmed and confused as I’m having to restructure my whole project around different bibliography and am really pretty much limited to either books that I already have or books I can find online.

I have a very limited budget and unfortunately actually buying the books is out of the question, so I was hoping maybe people could help me with recommendations of works I could check out and could be useful for my work. Is there a sub for that? Or is that something I could do here? I could really really use some help, I feel like I’m falling apart.

My thesis is in the field of film studies/archival studies too, if there’s anyone out there who might be interested and able to help :) I won’t reveal the specifics of it on here but will gladly discuss it in private or even in public if it seems that it’s okay and appropriate.

Thank you!"
How to find research topic?,"I'm a CS undergrad with prior studies in actuarial science (33 credits) and 2 internships in that field (1 in research for auto insurance and the other at an auto insurance company). I figured I was bored to death by insurance but loved the probability/stats/CS aspect of what I'd learned and applied during my internships.

They just announced additional research funding for 12-week ""internships"" this summer at my university and I want to apply. My data science internship this summer got cancelled due to Covid-19 and I will be applying to grad schools in AI this year.

I'm mainly interested in maps, computer vision, autonomous vehicles and AI in general. I've done a little bit of research on these areas of studies on google but honestly I don't know much about them even though they interest me, so I'm having a hard time figuring out what research topic I could present in my application.

What is needed to be advanced in those fields and would be accessible for an undergrad?

Thanks!"
"For those having trouble staying motivated while writing your thesis/dissertation, I thought I would share something that has helped me tremendously...","I see a lot of posts about people lacking motivation to write or push forward with their theses, dissertations, and manuscripts.  I’ve been there, and could barely bring myself to begin writing my PhD research proposal at all my first semester.  It’s mentally draining when you know you should be writing, but you keep stalling anyway.  

A while back I saw a post where a PhD student kept a word log of his dissertation writing progress and made a histogram/line chart with it. I thought it was a cool idea so I decided to do the same just for fun. I can’t post pictures to this thread but I’ll provide a link to my example.

However, what I have discovered is that this running word count has provided a tangible source of motivation and inspiration. Every day you write, even if you only add a single sentence to your manuscript, the line goes up.  It allows me to keep track of highly productive days, see that I’m capable of writing significant chunks at a time, and helps me stay on track with daily writing goals. 

This is just something that has been useful for me personally. Everyone works differently and are motivated by different things. But, in the sea of stress that is grad school, I just wanted to offer a small tip about something that has helped me, and hopefully a couple of you may benefit from it as well. Good luck with your writing!

Those in their first year trying to find an advisor: how is your program handling spring rotations?,"Incoming first year in biology here! The admins of my future program have told us that if the campus is shut down for the fall term, first years would have to do a virtual rotation. 

My type of research is very hands-on and bench-necessary, so I’m concerned about my performance and ability in the case of having to work from home in a brand new research focus. 

How have your programs (particularly for experimental scientists, but please jump in even if you’re in a different kind of program!) been handling this, and how do they expect to handle a possible closure in the fall?

Thanks ❤️"

How to ask professor to co-author a research project/article,"Background: I am 1st year PhD student (social science field) & need advice on whether I should ask a professor to work on a project with me. 

I just finished a course that opened my eyes to a whole new area of research that has yet to be explored. My final paper for this class highlighted all the areas for future research and my professor seemed to be interested. 

I emailed my professor after and told him I am interested in researching the topic & asked about a potential dataset. He responded and made it sound like the dataset I found could work, and then said he could provide me advice if I were to use the dataset. 

Would it be weird to respond and ask the professor if we could turn a part of my final paper into a research project (with him co-authoring)? 

My only dilemma is that I am currently assigned to a different professor to conduct research with, but this research project isn't really my assigned professor's area of research.  So I don't know if I should present this idea to the professor I'm assigned to or to the professor that taught the class... 

Any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!! I have never gone to a professor with a research idea before, so I don't really know how to approach this/ask correctly..."
Is it a meta-analysis if theres no statistical analysis?,"I want to do a quasi-meta-analysis for a paper that's due  soonish, but I have limited knowledge on statistics and zero access to any statistical analysis programs."
How to remember proposed approach from many papers / journals ?,"Throughout my study, I read numerous number of papers that related to my work (I'm in computer science by the way). But when I came across a topic, and it mentioned a specific paper that I have read, most of the time I don't remember how was the solution, only remember what was the problem mentioned in it and what's the output. Meanwhile the important part is to remember HOW.. what people have done (solution) to address the issue. For example I read a paper about recoloring more than 3 times, after 3 months I already forget the solution they proposed, just remember that I have read that paper, I remember it's proposing a faster / realtime recoloring, and I remember the output (even all the images) and what it lacks. But I always forget the solution approach.  
Does this only happen to me ?  
  

In computer science papers, a lot of maths is usually involved, optics, and other complicated approach that sometimes I have never tried to use before in my academic career. Is that why is it hard to remember ? All the complicated and ""foreign"" part ? Does that mean I've failed to completely understand what I read ? How do I learn to remember this kind of thing ? Any trick / advice on remembering papers / journals ?"
"Hi all, Ive been offered the opportunity to apply for a placement, but not sure whether to...","Pretty self explanatory really. I'm currently in the second year of my full time PhD.

I'm full steam ahead with everything but now I've been offered the chance to do a placement in Canada (I'm in the UK) and honestly I'm so conflicted.

On one hand, it's a huge opportunity, on the other hand I have anxiety and I'm not sure being in a foreign country for 3 months will be all that good for me.

Am I being an idiot if I don't take the chance?"

PhD students demands my source articles as PDF-documents,"Hello,

I'm a master's student and I handed in a paper with one of my department's phd students as part of a class. This is a sort of replacement task as I couldn't complete a class of his professor's last year so there's no other students involved in this.


When I handed the paper in, he replied to tell me he requires all cited articles as PDF-documents. This sounds nothing like standard practice to me. Many of the articles are copyrighted and only available through a valid Elsevier subscription.

When I addressed these concerns with him he simply replied ""Thanks, I'm looking forward to reading the documents!"", not acknowledging my questions at all.


Is this normal? Because I'm feeling uncomfortable infringing on someone's copyright so my supervisor has an easier time writing his own PhD thesis (on the same topic)."

How does having research mentors at other institutions work?,"Hi everyone,

I am headed to the UW School of Medicine next year with a really strong interest in medical anthropology. The problem is, UW does not have a particularly strong medical or biological anthropology program. They do have very strong public health programs, but the closest they really get to touching anthropology/ethnography is 'biobehavioral science' and that's sort of a ways away. 

So, I'm hoping that I could find research mentorship from other institutions. There are some researchers at UCSF in particular who are doing work that I'm really interested in. 

How does it work to have research mentors at other institutions? Can you even do that? Does it just look like a ton of emailing and Skyping?

Thanks for your help!!"
A vent about finishing my dissertation with incomplete data,"I’m disappointed in myself for the situation I’ve gotten myself in. I’m in my last year of my psychology PhD program and am planning to defend my dissertation over the summer. I should have had my data fully collected before Spring 2020 even began, but it just didn’t happen. 


It took me way longer than I expected to get the stimuli right, then I had poor recruitment of infants for my development work and slow sign-ups for my studies with undergraduates. With Covid, all research came to a halt in our department. But I can’t even blame Covid because I was in this situation when the semester started! One of my conditions with infants has 8 participants, and only 2 conditions (out of 10, across three studies) are complete. 


I’m disappointed that I don’t have more analyzable and interpretable data at this stage, in my sixth year of study (joint MA & PhD). Coming into grad school I had such high expectations for my research and my dissertation, but now it feels like I’m skating by on the bare minimum. I’m so thankful that my department is understanding, and I’m thankful that I can write from home without too many issues. But I know I could have prevented this and generated a stronger dissertation just by being more productive earlier in my graduate career.


Anyways, thanks for reading if you did!"
"When writing your papers, how do *you* prefer to include excerpts that contain citations?","An example of what I'm talking about:

> Dependency involves some form of constraint, as is seen in various dependency and co-dependency theories from World Systems Theory (Wallerstein 1976) to psychology (Rice 1998). Humans become involved in various dependencies that limit their abilities to develop, as societies or as individuals.

> Hodder, Ian. Entangled (p. 18). Wiley. Kindle Edition. 

I realized that I tend to instinctively avoid using excerpts that contain citations, instead choosing to look for some other sentences to cite that don't have that issue. So, upon encountering the above text, I'd look for some other sentences to use as an excerpt.

Imagine you want to include this as an excerpt because you don't feel that any other sentences do an acceptable job of conveying what you're trying to convey. How do you do it?

One common way to sidestep the issue is to paraphrase instead of quote. You'd still cite Hodder, but Wallerstein and Rice wouldn't be mentioned at all.

But suppose you *really* want to provide the quote. Do you provide it exactly as it is? If so, would you add Wallerstein and Rice to your bibliography or omit them?

Maybe this is obvious and my brain is just fried from working on my thesis for so long... If so, then please be gentle."
How do you deal with edits to a manuscript by your advisor without drowning your inner voice in it?,"My question as a PhD student is related to an experience I had dealing with a recent manuscript where the initial version of the paper was edited heavily by my advisor who removed bunch of stuff I wrote. When it went for the reviewers, they were asking about something’s in the paper which was some stuff that was edited out by the advisor. Such as I had a paragraph on why we did x, but he/her removed it. Then a reviewer said the paper lacks information why we did x. Granted some of edits he/her makes are helpful since I’m still mastering the art. But how do you handle such a situation?"
"After working for about a month on a key part of my paper, I found out that the results show no meaningful conclusions at all :D","So I've been studying how climate affects power systems, with my country as a case study. So I took historical climate data and dug up historical load profiles with some assumptions here and there. This process took me about a month or so, since there was so much shit to go through. And after everything, when I finally tried using regression on them, it turns out that there is no significant correlation between the variables. :D

So that's probably an entire month wasted for now, and a crucial part of my thesis and paper gone, so I'll have to write a somewhat lesser quality paper with all the other stuff in the research and submit it to a somewhat lesser quality journal.

Can I be held accountable for data I generated that is unethically manipulated by someone else?,"Brief background. I recently left grad school with a masters because after working on a continuation of someone else’s project, I discovered that this person fabricated most of their data. I could not reproduce anything they did, nor could three other lab mates or my advisor. Once I found irrefutable evidence of fabrication, I presented it to my advisor, but they were incredibly defensive, denied everything and ultimately told me “Well X saw the phenotype and saw Y, Z results, so you should be able to do the same thing.” X being the person who fabricated the data. I ultimately left feeling pressured to fabricate data and decided to get the fuck out of there. I should also mention that part of my advisors argument in response to the fabrication was “Well none of its published,” as if this makes it any less unethical that this person fabricated data?!? I also learned after I left that my advisor is poorly respected by others in the field, specifically because other researchers question the integrity of their findings. 

Now I’ve left, graduated, already started working a job I love and my advisor has asked for all my data. I know this is common practice, but I know they plan to use my data to publish a paper. What if they unethically manipulate my data? Am I liable for this? I already told my advisor I have no interest in being an author on this paper because I do not want to be associated with potentially fabricated data. I also plan to report them if I see that they publish data that I know to be fabricated, but until they publish it, I don’t really feel like there is much I can do. 

Thanks in advance for your advice. Happy sciencing!"
Why did a professor not have grad students for a very long time?,"Hi! I have a very high expectation of a prof who is super approachable and kind. The only red flag I'm having now is that although he's a professor (not assistant nor associate), he has no previous grad student. His lab has been founded \~10 yrs. Is it normal for a lab like this? I don't have people to talk to as I'll be the first grad student if I joined the lab. Thanks!"
Have you ever failed to reproduce results that your own research group published? How has that affected you?,"I'm a graduate student in a well-respected lab, and I've just spent three years of my life inadvertently disproving several core conclusions from a paper my lab published just before I joined. I now have to start a totally new project at the end of my fourth year of my PhD, and I don’t get to publish any of the work I’ve done up to this point because it would make my lab look bad. I know several other people from my own school who have been in similar situations with various degrees of professional impact. 

I want to hear your story. Have you, or someone you know, disproven or failed to reproduce your lab’s previously published work? How has that affected you? Even if it was just a side project, please share. Even if you aren’t sure whether the problem is you, or the previous researcher, I want to hear your story."
Disheartening rejection of papers,"I'm so disappointed and disheartened right now. We submitted two papers from my recently (in January) concluded PhD work to Science.

Both got rejected at the editorial desk citing the work is not of enough interest to the broader scientific community.

In February when we uploaded the preprints to bioarxiv, they generated a storm of discussions on multiple fora which included experimental and theoretical neuroscientists, philosophers and even physicists as we tackled the question of whether the frontal or occipital brain regions are responsible for conscious awareness (monkey electrophysiology with Utah arrays using no-report binocular rivalry).

Yeah, but technical papers on oscillations in memory get published. How is that of general interest when ours generated a storm of discussions by people from multiple disciplines? 

Literally work on the same thing from our own lab has been published multiple times in Science and Nature in the past 20 yrs. 

7 yrs of work. Damn it. 7 yrs for these 2 papers.

We are now going to Nat Neuro.

God, so frustrated."
Advice for preparations for a lockdown?,"The country I'm currently in has yet to do a lockdown, but we're expecting the government (or at least the university) to issue some form of restrictions.

What to do if I hate research,"First year PhD student in computational chemistry and hitting the problem (other than balancing classes, research, and life) that I really don't like research. I'm doing a degree because I want to teach undergrad chemistry and I don't like being in lab, but to get the degree I have to do chemistry. While I was applying I thought ""eh, it'll just be a few years of research, I'll be fine"" but then I get into doing the research and I just flat-out don't like it. It doesn't click with me, I don't have the passion for it that the other students in my research group do, and I have no clue what I would even want to research for a dissertation (although that's quite a ways down the road). Does anyone have ways to make research more likeable/less dreadful, or if I don't like research am I just wasting my time being here?"

How can I carry out qualitative analysis on a close-ended survey?,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I am currently undertaking a 10,000 word dissertation for my final year. My thesis gravitates around the major obstacles to small business success in the United Kingdom. I have found the appropriate data sets to answer my research questions, however I am not sure how to approach the analysis of this data. I was told that regression analysis would be a great way to dissect my data, however the nature of my research questions are not compatible with regression analysis. Furthermore, I've never been taught how to property do regression analysis (I only have a vague idea of what it is. The main issue I perceived is that I cannot find a value for my variables)

I have heard that qualitative analysis is great for open-ended surveys, but the survey that I found is pretty close ended (again, I'm not sure... I really suck when it comes to research methods). The main question asked is, ""What would you say are the major obstacles to success to your business?"" and respondents are asked to choose from 10 options. So, I was wondering - how can I qualitatively analyse closed-ended surveys? Is it possible? Or better yet, do you have any suggestions on how I can approach this data? 

I have provided a screenshot of one of the questions in the data set below. I hope you can help me overcome this obstacle!

How important is organic chemistry?,"It’s looking like I’m not gonna do too hot in my second semester of organic chemistry. I can recognize that’ll probably stop me from getting into a PhD straight from my undergrad, but what about a masters?

I couldn't decide whether my advisor asking my permission or she is being considerete before giving my project to another student.,"Hello everyone, I recently have been approached by my advisor about a certain project and she wants to give it to another graduate student in our lab. They talked it between them and my advisor said she would ask me first.  

For a little context, We are an evolutionary genetics lab. My research is more on the mechanistic side as I am curious about what factors effect meiosis and oogenesis in the most broad sense. but We had an idea day and she asked us to think projects or rather ideas and we can start to shapen up the chapters in our dissertation. So there was a bit literature research on my part but I came up with a project on transposable elements. That idea is more bioinformatics and different from what I am doing right now. My advisor helped me to develop this idea. She suggested a few things to make it more interesting. I did some reaserch on it. And I decided to postpone it for a while as there were more prominent experiments going on. 

Now it is almost a year after that ""idea day"" I did little on that particular project but there is a preliminary analysis and I found a program to work with. but so far everyone thought as that project was my brain child. My advisor recently wanted to talked to me about this project and she asked if I consider giving it to the other graduate student. As she is considering to switch from master's to PhD and she is interested in bioinformatics aspect of the projects. I obviously don't want to but couldn't help but wonder if she was asking it out of curtesy and I guess we don't own ideas or projects at this moments. 

Also for the timeline both of us plan to work around a similar time and my advisor said there wasn't ant rush on her part to finish it. I feel like I am pressured into giving up."
F31 application score is in and it wasn’t discussed,"I thought everything was perfect and I put in weeks of effort to make the application so strong. But I guess the two reviewers I got didn’t see it that way.

Side projects,"Greetings seasoned beans. 

I'm an incoming immunology PhD student. I have about two and a half years of being in a lab under my belt, with about 60% of that during undergrad (so I only had one thing I was working on) and 40% of the rest spent as a post-bacc student. 

How normal is it to have multiple projects - and if you have more than one, are they in the same realm as your main one or are they in different areas? 

I had multiple projects assigned to me during this start of my post-bacc program and I was never fully invested in them besides the first one. I'm wondering if it was because they were in completely different areas (my main one studying in vivo autoimmune stuff and another being in in vrito allergy stuff) or if I was just at project management. If the latter is the case, is there anything that helped you with project management? 

While I'm here, does anyone have any good intro to computational immunology resources they'd like to recc to a newb? I know I can google this (which I fully intend to do), I just wanted to see if there was a jumping off point that anyone especially liked. 

Sincerely,

Feeling of unpreparedness,"Does anyone else have an extreme sense of unpreparedness? 

I'm in my second semester of grad school studying biology and I just have this overwhelming feeling of being underprepared and just failing with my research.

It's odd because I have been doing well in my classes and don't have any concerns but I feel like I'm floundering for my research. It doesn't help that at the moment my PI is currently out of country and won't be back too soon. I have my method plan I'm going by though and just hoping for the best.

I just feel as if I am not dedicating enough time to my research but at the same time it feels as if I don't know where to invest my time in it. Luckily I have a great support system here, I just am worried about failing them and failing myself. I guess my overall question is: does anyone else have this feeling? And how do you or people manage it?"

I know it’s not a good thing to compare but I feel like I’m constantly behind on everything and constantly stressed too. I don’t understand how I can be so behind. I don’t understand where the day goes and why I can’t get everything done.

How to Start Preparing For a PhD?,"Hi folks, 

I have a Bachelors degree in English and a Masters degree in Mass Communication & Journalism. I've been a content writer for 2 years and for the last 2 years I'm working in the digital marketing field mainly writing technical content. 

I'd like to pursue a PhD and my real interest lies in women's issues. I'd be interested in studying Muslim women in India because I'm a Muslim woman from India and I'm hoping to gain insight into the lives of women who are not as privileged as I am. Perhaps I'll end up making a difference in someone's life through my studies. But I'm not sure where to start from. 

I think, I would like to study Muslim women's participation in the workforce in India. I did a quick Google search yesterday and I don't see many research going on on the subject. A lot of people have been researching on the education of Muslim women in India. In my experience, every muslim girl is pursuing education these days. In my neighbourhood, girl from orthodox families are pursuing Masters. Not really a big deal here.

How did I go about from here?

I'd be grateful for any advice on how to start preparing for a PhD. "

Anyways,  I advise the group i run to stay away from producing cockroach papers,  papers that incrementally build on the state of the art in the most  minimal way possible.  My advisor's group on the other hand seems to  thrive on these papers.  Its \*very\* frustrating and I'm not sure what to  do.  Although he is well known in the field and has published hundreds  of more papers than I have, I generally am always well funded and  sponsors like working with our group.

I  am about to begin my second project for my PhD doing segmentation. The  imagery i am using is from a very uncommon phenomenology but effectively  looks like a speckled photograph. I have been spending weeks  characterizing my data trying to apply a domain prior to it to improve  segmentation.  There is currently nothing in the literature that comes  even close to a off the shelf deep learning network.  My advisor wants  me to take Haralick features and initialize them as the conv weights (im  skipping a lot of detail here but i hope you get the idea) and publish  that.  This seems trivial and if i reviewed this paper, i would clearly  reject it.  However, many ppl from my advisors lab are doing this and  getting papers through.  It makes no sense and I am clearly frustrated  with this whole process.  Such efforts seem obvious and like a complete  waste of time thinking about and going through the pains of writing up."
"What is the meaning of ""rescue""?","Hi! Sometimes in presentations, I can hear of the term ""rescue"" in the sense of knock-out gene modification. Is that like for a gene, the double knock out homozygous will die, but then if I use a vector to transport a copy of that gene into the cell, the cell survives. In this case, can I say like the vector rescued the cell? If this is wrong, could someone tell me the meaning of ""rescue""? Thanks!"

Opening access to scientific journals,"Hi everyone,

I'm writing a reflection essay about the ethical problems of research, and came across the large gap between the public and research scientists.

Would you support granting access to scientific journals for libraries and high schools to allow access to manuscripts for young scientists and the public? Why or why not?

Please let me know if this breaks any of the subreddit rules."
Data Interpretation,What's your process/routine for analyzing data? How long do you usually spend interpreting it?
Where to start??,"Looking for some basic info and feedback about MBA’s!

Disclaimer: I have little knowledge on graduate degrees. Just starting to research. 

Background: 

* 24 M 
* Working in Occupational Safety 
* Washington D.C. Metro area
* Graduated with a B.S. in Occupational Safety (3.88 GPA) from smaller D2 school in Pennsylvania 
* Never been the best student but I really buckled down in college and found a love for education and worked hard for a good GPA. I credit making it this far in life from common sense and street smarts!
* Part time officer in the Air Force
* Salary: 100K
   * Project Salary: 125K by age 26 (step 1 promotion)
   * 160K by 30 (step 2 promotion)
   * Both salary projections are with no graduate degree 
* Employer: Electrical Power/ Transportation Contractor 
   * 1000ish employees 
   * 500 million per year revenue 
   * Does not offer continuing education benefits 

&#x200B;

Goals: 

I’ve always been interested in finances and the business side of the company. 

We don’t have a large number of professionals in our career field (Occupational Safety) that peruse advanced degrees so I feel like this would be a great advantage for me. 

I’m mostly interested in an MBA but would also consider a Master’s of Science.  

My idea is this degree would be great to put me on track for a Director position, Vice President, or any equivalent Executive position. 

I have the potential to open my own business later on down the road and I also do real estate investing so a program where you have some solid business takeaways is a must. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Given I may have to pay for this out of pocket I’m trying to find a balance between a reasonable cost and a program that has a good reputation. 

Is this realistic? Or should I just be looking at this as a check in the box and networking opportunity? 

I don’t even understand the rankings. 

It’s tough to rationalize when my undergrad is already making me 100K with 50K upside potential over the next 10 years. 

I’ll be working full time in the DC area while perusing this so it’ll have to be a part time or online program.

I will consider doctorate level degrees down the road after. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Does any specific programs jump out?

I understand most MBA’s have a specific focus right?

Do all programs require the GMAT or GRE?

Anything else I’m missing?

THANK YOU!"

A question about a Master's thesis topic...,"Background: I have an education in Psychology, however, have always enjoyed literature at it's core. I almost picked up a minor in university, if it wasn't for lack of funding. The following questions pertain to a researched based master's degree.

Please let this be known, I'm doing this just out of self-interest. I've been wondering if it would be acceptable to analyze an author's works under the view of a psychological perspective and the adaptations to the 21st century. This is just one of my ideas, mind you. My main concern is if the bulk of the paper becomes more psychological than literature based, would this still be acceptable at the given level?

Kind thoughts appreciated, let's keep this positive!"
Need some guidance,"I have two Bachelor degrees one is Psychology and the other in Sociology. I currently work in public service, I’ve been in public service for almost 5 years. I graduated in 2015 from my Undergrad. I do have the ability to take courses at my local community college to get refreshers if need be. 

I’ve been wanting to get further education.. my current career doesn’t bode well with raising a family.. so I’ve been looking at degrees that would open doors for me to be able to raise a family but also earn more then I am now. I earn about 52k a year.. 

I’ve been looking at becoming at Physical Therapy and Speech and Language Pathology. One you need only your Masters the other is a PhD. 

I am looking for feed back of people who have taken either course or know people who have careers in those fields and the pluses and minuses of each one.

If anyone has recommendations on other fields I should look into, I’m open for suggestions. ( the only things I struggle at is Math and some sciences). 

Thanks."
Feedback on Manuscript Feels Superficial,"I’m starting a PhD program in Ecology this fall and really want to try to publish some undergrad work this summer since I don’t anticipate having time once I start grad school... but I feel I lack the experience and support necessary to get the manuscript into a publishable condition. 

The field/lab portion of the study have relatively low sample sizes as they were completed entirely by myself over the course of 2 months during one summer (through an NSF REU program). Without going into too much detail, the field study was plagued with issues outside of my control and ultimately the data and hence the manuscript feel lackluster and ambiguous. However, besides cleaning up the discussion section and some basic formatting, it’s a completed manuscript.

Now my advisor has suggested we completely remove the field study from the manuscript. It was not intended to be a standalone study and without the field experiment, it loses any context that MIGHT make it meaningful. Not to mention that I’d have to rewrite most of the manuscript if we proceed with the lab study only. The whole thing feels like a garbage fire and the edits I’ve received are minor and almost entirely stylistic. I’m not making real progress and don’t know how to get the guidance I need to make progress and this feels like a huge waste of time. 

My advisor and I only communicate via email due to geographic distance and the longest email I’ve received from him in the past year has been around 5 short sentences. This is by far the worst research I’ve ever done, and it doesn’t feel valuable or publishable, but I nonetheless feel obligated to press forward with it because I’m not the only one involved and my advisor seems to think it’s publishable. However, I lack the experience and guidance to actually move forward. Any advice (or commiseration) would be appreciated."
How can I fit my paper in conference page limit?,"My paper finally got accepted on my 4th attempt. Now when I am trying to reformat my paper in the template shared by them for camera ready submission, it is going out of limits by a lot. The template is Springer LNCS. It has huge margins and one column text. My paper goes to a whopping 15 pages right now. Page limit is 11.  I have 2 figures and 2 tables in paper.

What are my options to fit the paper somehow? Can I changes format to double column? Can I remove/summaries few less important paragraphs from my paper? Or is there anything else I can do? 

I did check the page limit earlier and did submit my paper in 10 pages(another Springer format with double column) but I didn't expect the page count to increase so much in a different format."

"When judging whether a PI is a good scientist, which parameter from the google scholar is the most important","Hi. I'm picking Pi for future rotations. I understand that a good PI should be both a good scientist and a good mentor. Since whether a PI is a good scientist is a bit easier to judge than the mentor side,  I started from this direction first. I saw that google scholar has total cited numbers, h-index, and !10 indexes, and the corresponding recent-5-yr version of the three numbers. I assume the recent-5-yr version is a better judgment, but for these three numbers, which one is the most important? If they focus on different aspects of a PI, could someone explain it? Of course, people with all three numbers being very high is the best, but when you are comparing PI in the middle, which factor(s) will play more important roles?  Thanks"
Thoughts on using text-to-speech programs to review literature?,"I know this may sound crazy, but one of my professors just posted a recorded lecture because she was unable to make it to one of our classes, and I loved it? I never thought of myself as an auditory learner, but it was so much easier to take notes. I guess I never put too much thought into it during the lecture because it was just what I had to do, but being able to pick my speed and pausing the video when I needed to and being able to revise what she explains was amazing. 

Is it an off the chart idea to try and do this with papers? I'm not a huge fan of reading papers, and I guess if I had someone reading it to me, I could just listen to it like a podcast and follow along on the paper and make notes as they are being said. It's like listening to a seminar talk or conference talk, which I also really like! 

Any thoughts are welcome!"
Failed Dissertation Defense: Need help with writing resources,"So, yes, I am that 1% who failed the dissertation defense. As I am picking up the pieces and trying to organize the 7-page document with 89 line items of changes, I am hoping to reach out to other grad students to try to find more resources for a successful re-defend.

First off, let me say this: I take 100% ownership of the failure. I put together the committee. I hired my editor. My name is on the paper. I also pushed for a compressed timeline. I did the defense. I was the CEO (so to speak) of this study. It's on me.

I also see this as an opportunity to make it even better.

&#x200B;

Here's what I think happened...

My committee is made up of a chairperson who is in my program of study (education policy), a person in the education department and then an expert in the field of study. When I got to my defense and I finished my presentation, things quickly went south. I was hit with questions about what the purpose of my study was, and how it didn't line up with my presentation or paper. Then my grammar and writing got picked apart. Finally, I was told I was going to have to re-defend.

The biggest thing was that my expert was expecting a much different paper based upon my proposal. However, my dissertation chair was the only one who was allowed to edit and comment. I ended up going with a conceptual framework based upon the chair's feedback, and the expert panelist wanted a model. Secondly, they picked apart my grammar, saying the writing was terrible. I did send it to an editor and have been working with an editor for the past 2 years (I am dyslexic and have some issues with sentence structure). However, it was still sub-par. Finally, the system is flawed. This particular program only allows the chair to give feedback and edits. The other two committee members do not get the paper until prior to the defense. So if your expert is not the chair, they might not see it until 7 days before the presentation.

&#x200B;

So, here's what I think I need (I am open to all suggestions)

1. A new editor (possibly found one)
2. A professional dissertation advisor/writer. Does this exist? Is there somebody that I can hire to help me look at my data and help me organize my writing process?

My current program's structure doesn't work. The proposal is supposed to be our first 3 chapters (intro, lit review,  methodology), but depending on what you find during the study, this could mean an entire re-write. The paper was disjointed in the end. The lit review didn't match up well with the findings.

3) Resources for better sentence structure. It's been 30 years since I had to do sentence structure. As an adult, is there any resources for basic sentence structure and writing?

&#x200B;

Anyways, just writing this all out has helped me organize some of my thoughts. Thanks in advance. I appreciate any help.

Edit: USA University. Technology in Arts Education is the topic. (my school is typically education policy focused so I am a bit more interdisciplinary than they are use to)"
Writing skills SOS,"How do/did you improve your technical writing skills while in grad school? 

My undergraduate program didn’t have any technical writing component, and my current program doesn’t have any writing seminar courses. On my first journal paper I killed myself writing and re-writing to submit my best work, but my advisor ended up re-writing all of my words in his style, thus I did not improve my writing during this process. What can I do to become a better writer on my own? Books? What can I ask my advisor to help me get better when his answer is to just re-write what I thought was a solid effort? 

If it helps, I’m in engineering."
How to find PIs?,"Hi! I'm applying to grad school soon. I'm looking at both journalism and women's/gender/feminist studies programs. I'm primarily interested in MA programs, but I am starting to consider a PhD as well. Right now, I'm finishing a dual degree in journalism and gender studies at undergrad.

I completed a major research project here at undergrad where I analyzed the news media through a feminist lens, focusing on racial and gender diversity in newsroom production and audience reception (so, identifying links between who makes the news, who they cover, and who consumes their work). It was accepted for presentation at two conferences. However, I go to a very small school, and the project was very small in scale and only done over one semester. I'd love to continue researching the news media through a feminist lens as a graduate student. I want to go deeper into what I studied before and expand the scope. I'm just not sure how to find someone currently doing this or related research at an institution! 

How do I find a PI? And if I can't find one specifically doing the research I'm interested in, is there any flexibility in deciding my own research path?"
Anyone have recommendations for programs/websites to track sources with APA 7th ed. citation style?,"Hey folks - sorry if this question has already come up but I am looking for the *latest* suggestions since the program I *was* using to keep track of my cited sources in my papers does not yet have the updated APA edition (7th edition) that came out just this past October. I'm specifically looking for a program that includes APA 7th edition style and is Windows/Microsoft Office compatible. I would prefer something free but I'll consider putting money into something to keep track of my sources because doing it by hand is simply too time consuming!  


Side note: I was just using the Microsoft Word to manage my sources! (I found this to be the most convenient method since I use Microsoft Word to write my papers as well). However, it appears my Microsoft Word still only supports APA 6th edition. I don't know if there was an update to address this, but as it stands I'm looking for alternatives!"
Any time management advice for writing papers?,I am so angry at myself for not finishing my final paper for a class. I had several figures and tables and formatting them took way longer than I expected so I ran out of time to do my analysis. I am so upset.
MSW/MPH student: Thinking about publishing?,"Hi all, I’m a first year student thinking about my career, and I’ve made a step in the right direction — presentations at professional conferences — now I am interested in publishing. Any tips? I have a professor interested in collaborating, on a different campus of my university. Thanks!"
Is it too early to switch advisors if I just finished my first semester as a master's student?,"Hello. I'm aware that questions regarding changing advisors has been asked frequently on this community, and I've also asked a few of my own previously, but after doing some thinking on the answers that I've received and read I felt that I needed some opinions or feedback regarding my situation.

I just finished my first semester as a computer science master's student but have been having doubts about staying in this lab for quite a while. The main reasons that I'm having feelings of doubt are:

1. Different research interests. When I first interviewed with the professor the research that he said I'd be doing was different from what I'm doing now.

2. Differences in approaches to research. My professor is more ""business-oriented"" (for lack of a better word) and only cares about the results (more specifically, I'm doing research in deep learning), while I want supervision on how to analyze those results in-depth.

3. Differences in values and principles (I'm not sure if this is an accurate way to put it). This is somewhat related to #2, but I've noticed that most of the people in the lab share an attitude along the lines of results-first. This attitude is somewhat understandable, but again it's not exactly how I want to approach my research. I've been ridiculed when people saw I was taking classes in the mathematics department, saying that ""you don't need those classes for deep learning.""

4. Lack of supervision in general. My advisor's always attending meetings and doesn't do any research of his own. The most advisory that students receive is either during our lab seminar or right before we're about to submit papers to conferences/journals.

Some of the things that are holding me back from making up my mind are:

1. Perhaps I'm just having feelings of frustration and don't know particularly well what I really want to do yet, and should give it some more time. My parents (who are both professors themselves) have said that it might not be a bad idea to take another semester to think on my doubts, and whether switching advisors would solve any of those problems.

2. Money. The lab that I'm at now is the largest in our department (even school maybe), and the professor does do a good job of bringing in government or company-funded projects. The students including myself usually get paid on a monthly basis, and we use this money to pay for our tuition with a bit extra. I'm aware that this isn't typical for our school, and the lab I'm at is privileged in that sense.

3. Fear of starting over. I'm not sure if there is any objective reason for me to feel this way, as it has only been one semester. I suppose the reason why I feel this way is because I want to get results out within the next two years so that I can apply for PhD programs elsewhere, and switching advisors gives me this massive feeling of anxiety that I'd be throwing away everything I've been involved in until now.

What would your advise be to someone who's just started graduate school and is already having these feelings? Would they be justifiable or perhaps I'm just acting like a child? Switching advisors isn't a trivial issue either, so any second opinions that I may receive are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance."
My advisor has pushed me in the wrong direction,"First: thanks for being great students and ppl! Remember that school is temporary and there is a lot more to our worth than grad school

Second: fuck this place. I'm in my fourth year and my advisor has forced me onto a project for 3 years now.  The initial project was expected to only take a year. This methodology paper has turned into a total synthesis and the story doesn't even make sense any more. This will likely go into my dissertation but it won't be a chapter in-and-of its self. I have two other projects that are more promising, one of which could potentially change our whole synthetic path. I'm getting irritated and disheartened when talking to him about how we need to change our approach."

Independent research study?,"Hi everyone,  I need some advice.  I am not sure if i will get accepted in my phd program so I am thinking of different solutions. One Ideas that I had was doing research at my current job as a side project or side job. It might let me get funded and etc. I am worried about bringing this up to my mentor and may need some advice to make them supportive of the idea. The cool thing is the data I get could be used for a dissertation for my PhD. So it would be applicable for my future plans that I can set into motion now as a master student regardless of my acceptance."
Keeping up with many projects or focus on one,"Hi everyone. I didn't know whether to use the Research or Admissions flair. Let me elaborate.

My background is CS and I'm conducting research on deep learning models (this is so common these days Inactually feel kind of weird saying it). Anyway, I told my advisor on Monday that I'm going to opt out of my integrated program and graduate with a master's, and also apply to PhD programs abroad this year.

He advised me that I should really try and get a publication with me as the first author out before applying, as it's not typically expected that master's students have their own publications (unless you're going for the ""top schools"") but that it would really help me make a difference, and even if the submission doesn't work out it'll be good experience.

Long story short, I'm currently involved in three research projects. I'm starting to think that focusing on one and dropping the other two will be a good idea so I can focus. The projects to be dropped I don't really see myself doing long term anyway. The submission date is less than two months away btw.

What would you do if you were in my shoes? I'm still a bit on the fence.

Just an FYI in case anyone's wondering, the research I want to continue is geometric deep learning (graph neural networks) and the ones I want to drop are NLP and financial ML."
MS in Finance looking for your opinions regarding a thesis topic,"Hello,

I am in my last year of grad school in Finance, I was thinking of using a topic on Foreign Investments.

Problem is, I feel like it it's more of an economics topic rather than a finance topic. Should I pursue this or no?"
Question: How do you go about understanding complex models/math you've never seen before?,"Essentially what the title says. I'm in an ecology/evolution background with a fair deal of coding and understanding of math concepts. However recently I've been trying to better understand some models seem perfect for my project based on its use but feel so road blocked everytime I open a paper.

Most of the trouble comes from either not knowing what a symbol is/means (found out an uppercase pi means product of by googling what does daddy pi do). Naturally this means I am stuck trying to figure out what each step means and how to utilize it properly.

Aside from taking classes, how did you start to understanding complicated models or math? Did you have to spend a few days going through every step, or did you just plug and play with the model and hope for the best?

Btw, the modeling I'm stuck on at the moment is for Joint Species Distribution Models from Tikhonov et al 2019"
"Paper got rejected, and unsurprisingly I'm questioning my entire PhD","A paper I've been trying to get accepted was rejected twice at different venues, and I already gave up on trying to get the work published. How do fellow PhD students deal with rejected papers? Do you take rejection as a marker for your research ability, or do you think it's luck? How do you cope with unreasonable or biased reviewers who simply didn't like the topic or task? It's so hard sometimes to not take their criticism personally and question your entire line of work going forward.

EDIT: if of any relevance, the field is computer vision/machine learning, so three things stand out: 1) research moves at lightning speed; 2) conference submissions are annual; 3) field saturated with thousands of submissions from both industry and academia."
Overview of research brief?,"Hi all, I’ve just started a new research project (GIS and mental health) and my advisor has asked for a draft research brief before our meeting next week.

Crossover between Computer Science and Business,"Have you folks ever seen or though a research topic/paper that is a crossover between computer science and accounting/finance)?

Edit: My mother is a professor in Finance. I'm a B.A. in Accounting and currently in Master's of Computer Science. I will be a Ph.D. in Accounting. I usually do research with her and to be honest, I cannot think of any topic that is a crossover between the 2 fields, CS and finance/accounting, given the different natures of them. For example, CS people think that it is more important to publish in conferences than in journal, but fin/accounting people think otherwise. Another thing is that finance/accounting field can get very intense on mathematical/quantitative stuffs - while CS is more about programming. 

I have read both fields' papers and projects. CS deals more with real life and finance/accounting is like...I don't know, maybe sometimes they just publish the papers to get tenure, it doesn't seem to benefit the life of anyone.

The only think that I can think of (that is a crossover) is how to use programming knowledge to run tests smoothly on finance/accounting field."
Where do you find cool PowerPoint templates?,I'm giving a talk at a really large conference in a few weeks and I want to have a cool PowerPoint template that isn't one of the pre-loaded themes on PowerPoint.

I think I may have found my ideal lab! Is there anything else I need to consider?,"I’m currently in my third rotation (out of a possible 5) of a Biomedical Sciences PhD program. My first two rotations didn’t feel like the right fit. The first was a tiny lab with a somewhat micro-managey PI, and the second was too high-risk in its research focus and had very long graduation times. 

My third rotation, which just started a week ago, felt like it clicked immediately. It’s a huge lab (like 40 people, around 15 are grad students) with a strong social bond. Extremely well funded and a very translational focus (my preference). The PI is supportive, obviously a bit busy, but according to his students he makes enough time for them, plus they all help each other deal with issues. All the students I’ve talked to seem very happy and have good work-life balance. Most students graduate with at least one high-impact first-author paper, often C/N/S. My project is fascinating as well.

What are some other factors I should consider before committing to this lab? So far the only downsides I’ve found are that the lab is pretty crowded (4 students are graduating soon so that should help) and there’s some occasional interpersonal drama (nothing serious, just a result of many different personalities in a small space)."
Being railroaded by a territorial peer-reviewer,"Guys, I am beyond infuriated right now.

So I submit a manuscript and the reviews come back. The first reviewer enjoys it a lot and makes helpful suggestions, the second goes on and on how I did not take into account the theoretical state-of-the-art of the field and that I need to rework the theory section to use it as a foundation. They then cite 5 papers (all with a common author and none with more than 1 or 2 citations from anyone that isn't that author, CURIOUS) that we ""need to use"". I review those papers. They are unclear and meandering, dense and almost impossible to parse, utterly useless for practitioners, which my paper is aimed at. But most importantly, *the theory is not even applicable to my paper because the author makes a fundamental assumption that cannot be applied to my work under any circumstance. In fact, logical extensions of my theory would render their theory obsolete and I could easily write another paper demonstrating this*.

So I write up a polite, but firm response letter detailing why the reviewer's requested changes will not be implemented and send the paper back. This paper has manuscript status logs and according to them, the reviewer returned their second review 12 minutes after confirming the invitation and wrote a two sentence ""review"" that just restated what they said the first time without any acknowledgement whatsoever of my response, claiming that I ""ignored"" their comments. So they didn't read my response obviously.

Now I'm mad, reddit. I contacted the editorial office to notify them of this, and I honestly would not mind if they out and out rejected me at this point. Am I out of line here? Is this common?"
Mental cost of publishing papers during PhD.,"I wanted to share that our lab deposited two papers in Bioarchive today. I am not the main author in either of those two papers, but I contributed significantly in both papers. We have been trying to publish one of the papers since January 2017. We tried submitting the paper in Nature, Cell, Cell Stem Cell, Nature Genetics, Nature Cell Biology, Nature Communications in that order after getting rejected each time. I have lost hope in publishing papers. For my own project, I have become very worried because my Prof won't allow me to publish in journals with low impact factor. My work is going fine, but getting it published in those high impact factor journals is going to take some miracles. I have seen my colleague struggling everytime her paper got rejected. I think I can't go through the same cycle.
For some unknown reason, my Prof decided to deposit the papers in Bioarchive. Maybe he also got tired of the process and wanted to move on. This has lifted a huge burden for my colleague. I can say she is happy because the research is in public domain. Publishing paper shouldn't be this hard. And if you combine the pressures of being a PhD student with it, it destroys you."
Need help on a research proposal on L2 language attrition and unconscious recall,"     Hello! I have some questions for you all regarding a research proposal I am working on for my ESL Theory class. 

     I want to propose a study that focuses on language attrition of people’s L2. I haven’t yet decided what linguistic feature I want to focus on, maybe you can suggest something. I was considering syntax or lexicon, but if you have a better idea please let me know.

     Anyways, I want to see to what degree people who have some degree of mastery of the language but who have not used it in a while (I’m thinking 1-2 years maybe more?) actually experience significant language attrition for a specific linguistic feature like their knowledge of the syntax of the L2. 

     I think that possibly when being tested normally they show signs of significant attrition, but I want to see if they actually experience that much or if they unconsciously can still properly, for example, remember certain lexical items that they don’t consciously. 
     I want to find a way to trick them into showing that they actually can do more than they consciously think they can. I was thinking about this because of how much easier I have found and others I know to speak another language when you are drinking. Obviously I am not going to propose getting participants drunk, but I’m wondering if any of you have an idea on how to do so. 

     I know this is very vague and may be stupid, but this is my only idea so far for a proposal for my ESL Theory class and it’s due on Wednesday. I’ve been focusing too hard on my sociolinguistics study 😕 at least that one is going well lol.

     If you have any other ideas for a research proposal or review paper related to second language acquisition, please let me know; I have ADHD which was untreated until Friday, so I’m super behind and desperate :("
How do you find industry collaborators for research?,"Generally for research, sometimes it can be academia but there has to be some industry help such as to acquire datasets. And these tend to have professional collaboration. My question is how do you find these collaborators generally? Is it through conferences and meetings/general emails?"
I feel like an underpaid babysitter for adults who aren’t actually adults yet,"This is my first summer as a grad student. I am in biology and I love TAing over the school year, but the summer has been so stressful and awful. My PI hired 8 undergrads as research assistants this summer but after the first couple weeks, she stopped coming in to manage them and the responsibility switched to me and the other grad student working in the lab. 

This is more of a rant if anything and to see if anyone else has this issue. It has been so draining trying to do my own work as well as constantly having to find something for the undergrads to do. I feel like a manager but without the perks of an actual manager- no one actually listens to me and there’s no discipline from my PI. These undergrads have messed up my research several times, they refuse to do the work I give them, they pester for different tasks, they just seem to endlessly pester me every day but they never actually listen to what I say. 

The final straw has been this week where I went on vacation for the week. It was approved by my PI, everyone knew I was leaving, yet at 9:05 am on the dot Monday morning I receive two frantic emails from an undergrad and my PI. Both demanding data for an undergrad project due two days later. Data I didn’t have, data I couldn’t send (no wifi) even if I did have it, for a project an undergrad procrastinated and didn’t mention until the last minute. I was roadtripping in the western USA where phone service is spotty and nonexistent but I still felt obligated to spend 1-2 hours typing data on my phone to send an email to both of them. 

I have been dealing with this for 8+ weeks and just wanted to vent & see if anyone else deals with this. I thought this would end after the summer but I just got an email from my PI stating she’s hiring 5 undergrads for the school year as well. Thank god this is just a masters degree!"
NIH Fellowships,"Hey all, does anyone know whether your lab needs to be funded by a specific institute in order for your F31 to also be funded. My sponsor is funded by the NIH (NHLBI and NIDA) but not by NINDS where my application seems to have been sent to. Wondering if that’s gunna be an automatic rejection."
Any faster way to input data into the ASA-24 survey?,My research project involves myself and two other graduate students to input a three day food log into ASA-24. It asks for three consecutive days which means that after I put in the first day of food I have to wait until the next day to input the next day of food.  We have to use this program so Is there a faster way to do this? Or maybe a shortcut I could do to make this process faster? It’s so tedious and time consuming!
How often do you meet your advisor?,"I understand that the answer would be relative to the field you are from, the kind of projects you are working on etc. But still, I am curious :)"
"I'm not a student but I love research, I have papers ready to go and I want to work and publish these papers. How do I go about doing that?","Is there anyone that has a similar experience? I regret not using my undergraduate work while I had the chance to publish these papers I wrote up in my spare time now and I wish I could go back and research because it felt so fulfilling to do it now. 

I know that if I can publish some papers I can make my grad school application look even better and get some experience in grad school type of research!

**EDIT:** Fields are Statistics and Economics."
How can I become a better researcher?,"Im in my second semester of graduate school in my pursuit of attaining a Master's degree in Pharmacology. I spent the first semester doing ELISA and Western Blot training and learning theory and background of those techniques. This semester part of me wants to pursue my own project within our lab (we are characterizing a monoclonal antibody) and part of me is too scared that I will mess up and make a fool of myself.

&#x200B;

What scares me and I need help with is the fact that there is sooooo much knowledge out there that its daunting almost. I still don't understand the technique intracies like why some solvents or solutions are used and what their purpose is and I feel like my PI will look poorly on me if I ask him. How can I become more comfortable in my field of research (Pharmacology) so I can ask the proper questions when doing research? How does one become knowledgeable in their field and ready to design their own experiments?"
Desperate for advice,"How do I even start this post... I guess with the fact that I am absolutely desperate for advice. I am a Master’s student in the field of ecology currently trying to finish up my thesis on edge effects. However, I am nearing the deadline for when my whole paper is due (11/1) and I do not have a proper discussion written. I also keep making stupid editing mistakes and I can tell my advisor is fed up with me. If I do not draft a great discussion, my advisor will not let me defend this semester. I need to get out. So, I am practically begging, **what makes a good discussion? What are your writing tips? How can I make this discussion section of my paper perfect on the first draft? **

I have a draft written, but I feel like I am rambling and speculating about my results and that it all means nothing. 

TL;DR: Please help me, what makes a good discussion section?"
Laboratory tips?,"I just started in a new lab and was wondering if anyone had any tips or tricks they've learned. Like storing supplies effectively, cleaning, staying on task, working with other grad students, documentation etc.

The lab I've joined is focused on membrane separation of blood. Lots of tubing, old parts, and such."
At what point do you decide that you've researched enough?,"I'm only in the first semester of my master's program, so I haven't gotten too heavy into research, but I do enjoy researching for my papers, even when it doesn't need to be that much

As I work on a couple of papers, I've been wondering if I'm overdoing it, or if I've researched enough to the point where any extra research produces marginal gains

How do you figure out that you've researched enough and it's time to actually start writing?"
Computer-based transcriptions: too good to be true?,"I am looking into options for transcribing and hopefully translating audio-recorded interviews. I was initially considering hiring someone but then learned about an alleged industry of computer-based transcription services.

I am wondering if this is too good to be true because the quoted costs are significantly lower than hiring a person.

Do any social scientists or other scholars have any experience with companies like Happy Scribe or their competitors? 

There are 2 languages in my interviews. Some are exclusively English, some are exclusively Tagalog and some are a mix of the 2 languages.

But I am still interested in English only services because maybe 40% of my interviews are exclusively English. If the service is real and still affordable with an option of English only, that means I could find an individual to help me with the remaining 60% that are in Tagalog. 

I had a translator for some of the interviews but their English is shaky. I got to the point where I was conducting interviews in Tagalog myself but that is after I memorized the questions and also groped my way through asking definitions of specific words as the interview unfolded. The point is, I will eventually need someone or some service to translate from Tagalog to English.

Any thoughts would be appreciated."
What to do with postdoc that I am collaborating with?,"I am working with him on a project and when the PI is not around. He is always trying to rush me off the phone. I know time is of the essence but I barely get a chance to discuss what we are working on. 

I am not asking for a lengthy discussion but 10 minutes to get feedback on how I am doing. He just makes edits and gives like a sentence of advice and that is it. I feel like I am going to get a paper out of this. However, I did not anticipate this work style."
How to Support a Friend Who Might be in a Position to be Taken Advantage of?,"So I have a friend in my lab who is entering her last semester of her Masters while applying to PhD programs.  She wanted to stay here at our school and enter the PhD program we are in, but our advisor essentially told her ""apply elsewhere."" :( It's fine because she technically wants to do research in a different field, so she went and fortunately got another professor in our department to give her a chance.

I'm happy for her, but a friend and I are worried.  Essentially, she will be working for this professor unpaid as a Masters student, on a project that two other Masters students have already failed at.  I'm confident she can succeed, but this professor has told her that the chances of getting into his lab as a PhD are ""low.""  My other friend who is also her friend already has a Masters and expressed concern that this professor could be using her for unpaid labor and could just as easily dump her, no matter how hard she works or whether she succeeds, at the end of the semester.  My friend even cancelled her Christmas vacation to stay here and do a literature review for the topic so she can hit the ground running next semester.  I so hope that she isn't just spinning her wheels for nothing.  She works hard and is a competent researcher who deserves to be here.

What I want to know is, in the event our worries are confirmed, how can we support her?  Do we let her know about our concerns now?  Do we say nothing to avoid putting negative thoughts in her head, and simply look for signs just in case?  If so, what are signs we could look for as outsiders looking in?  What can we do if we end up being right and come next semester's end that professor hangs her out to dry?"
Only a small number of people actually care about your research.,"Does anyone get discourage by the fact that only a niche group of people actually care about your research? I’ve been thinking the last few days that all this time and effort I’m putting in to my research is going to be appreciated by few people. Mostly by those who are in a very similar field of research as me. My research probably will never reach the general public, and even if it did, few would even care.  It just sucks knowing that what I think is super important isn’t important to the majority of others."
I passed my defense!,"Welp, I did it. I successfully defended my master's thesis today, with only some minor revisions (mostly formatting and the need to add a bit more meat in a couple parts). 

I'm officially graduating in December. 

I am so, so relieved."
[Elsevier Webinar] Research Career Wednesday 29 January at 13:00 (UTC),"**Top 5 career questions for researchers**

[https://researcheracademy.elsevier.com/career-path/career-guidance/top-5-career-questions-researchers#.XinuCnux88Q](https://researcheracademy.elsevier.com/career-path/career-guidance/top-5-career-questions-researchers#.XinuCnux88Q) 

How do you take decisions regarding your professional future as a researcher? Making a career in academia can be challenging and it's natural to feel like you don't see the complete picture. Building on the considerable experience in coaching researchers and the questions raised during a popular Researcher Academy [career module](https://researcheracademy.elsevier.com/career-path/job-search/make-phd-capabilities-find-fulfilling-jobs) of January 2019, Researcher Academy is presenting you a new, live module answering all your questions about making a career in research.

In this module, experts Ralph Rousseau and Chiat Cheong will present to you many opportunities that are suitable for PhD graduates and researchers. They will also discuss how to avoid adapting yourself to fit a specific job description and instead start to identify jobs that suit you.

&#x200B;

Speakers:

**Chiat Cheong**, Founder Qia Consultancy & Training and Policy Advisor at the University of Amsterdam.

Chiat is scientist by training. She spent the first 11 years of her career in academic research, in the field of cancer gene therapy. When academia could no longer provide her what she looked for in a career, she changed her professional focus. Since 2009 she supports scientists in career orientation, benefitting from her research background and the struggles in career transition she went through herself. In 2016 she established Qia Consultancy & Training to provide consultancy to research organizations in the set-up of PhD programmes for career orientation.

**Ralph Rousseau Meulenbroeks**, Assistant professor science education at Utrecht University, motivational speaker, professional musician

Ralph Rousseau Meulenbroeks holds a PhD in physics and graduated cum laude in the fields of physics, music (viola da gamba), and science education. He has been a soloist with major orchestras such as the Concertgebouw Orchestra and was employed in fusion physics research, but he also worked as a high school physics teacher. He currently combines an assistant professorship at Utrecht University (educational sciences) with his activities in music and motivational speaking. His prime interest is intrinsic motivation."
HIGHLY interested in moving to Germany for Grad School. Any advice?,"I am in the initial stages of my research and am narrowing down my options. But I am pretty confident that I will pursue psychology/counseling. 

I am an American citizen living on the east coast and have my bachelor’s in criminal justice. 

If anyone has made a similar move, what advice do you have for me? 

Any and all advice is appreciated. 
Thank you all"
What can I do to set myself up to work in top national labs while doing PhD?,"**If you do not have the chance to work with faculty who has ties with them (funding, collaborations, etc.), what do I have to focus on? (quality of my dissertation, internship in those labs, right location of school, etc.)**"
Meeting with a potential graduate advisor today-how to make a good first impression?,"Hello, I am meeting with a possible History graduate advisor today, who also happens to be the person who accepts graduates into their department, and I need to know how to make a lasting good first impression on her. I know I’m going to discuss how her research interests and past work align with my own interests and how I believe it would benefit both of us if I was under her supervision. What else should I say to make myself stand out?"
Software/app for interviews?,"Hey! I am interviewing a few individuals for a project I'm working on, and was wondering what programs you have used in the past to record audio from Skype calls and phone calls?

 Must be in MP3 file format so I can use a transcript service. Must also be very reliable and good quality audio.

 TIA!"
"What are the low cost, online grad schools?","I have recently graduated from UC Berkeley, and I want to pursue grad school. I want something online, and low cost. 

I am considering Boston University’s MBA, Western Governor University, and Georgia Techs OMSCS.

Am I missing another low cost, but credible school or program?"
"After 5 years, I feel no closer to graduation. I’ve produced an enormous amount of negative data. My PI throws me under the bus to my committee and, without offering me any advice or direction, will be the first one to say, ‘I told you so.’","Hi everyone, I feel so lost. My committee always rips me to shreds. Mostly it’s just one of my committee members, but everyone else silently agrees by not offering counterpoints or helpful suggestions. Worst of all is my PI, who not only agrees with the committee member that is annihilating every last shred of my project without offering possible directions to go, but also goes out of his way to tell me he has felt the same way for months, but wanted to wait until I had a committee meeting for everyone to find out.

I’ve pioneered several technologies in my lab and have acquired a lot of data (nothing really publishable since all of it seems to be negative data [aka a bunch of things don’t have effects]). However, scraping together a publishable unit seems daunting. I don’t want to spend more time here only to publish in a lower tier journal. 

I already have my Masters from when I defended my oral prelim. I don’t have a paper showing the wide range of techniques I have (techniques I was hoping to leverage in finding a career in genetic engineering). However I worry that staying here for 2-2.5 more years will hurt my career prospects.

I feel like I have no feedback. Until it’s too late. I sincerely think I’m not cut out for science or experimental design.

Should I cut my losses and leave with my Masters or is trying for a publication that showcases my technical abilities (even if it’s in a shitty paper In a shitty journal) worth it to get a subpar PhD?"
How do you keep notes with your advisor?,How do you keep notes of the meetings and the things to do with your advisor on research and them she/he updated on it as well in a collaborative way? I’ve been thinking of having a shared google doc so that we both can add notes to it during meetings. But we have couple of other documents. The method is somewhat good but open for suggestions.
How do you do scientific illustrations?,"I'm a PhD student and I would say my biggest roadblock is making good scientific illustrations. I wanted to know how other people in grad school deal with this? Are you very proficient at Photoshop/Illustrator? Do you use a third-party and pay them? Or do you have support from your school? 

I try my best on Photoshop and Illustrator but it takes me a long time and it doesn't look as good as some of the ones I see in Nature and Science."
Interview an expert for a master's research paper.,"Hi all. I'm in my first class of an online master's program in Public Administration. Unfortunately my professor is not very responsive so I thought I would put this out to the group. Our final is a 10 page research paper and I'm writing mine on Lean management. I have a co-worker whom I would consider an expert on this topic. I plan on using many other sources, both scholarly and otherwise, but it is acceptable to use my co-worker as a viable source as well?"
Trouble understanding research papers,"I am a new masters student in my second semester of grad school in electrical and computer engineering. I am having trouble understanding a lot of the research papers I am reading due to:
1. Not knowing the mathematical notation of a lot of the papers I am reading
2. Having trouble understanding the actual math due to not having a course in this level abstract or statistical mathematics

A lot of my papers talk about minimizing the L2 norm for exampe and I am trying to find a resource or multiple resources to help me understanding the notation and what is actually being done when the paper is trying to minimize the L2 norm (just an example).

If anyone has any good links or books I should pick up I would greatly apprecaite that."
Preparations for Thesis Writing,"Hi good people! Looking for advice when it comes for preparing for thesis writing. Semester starts next week, and I've been gathering up literature to narrow down my research topics that I'm interested on. Other than this, do you have any other preparations that you did when you were in my position? (P.S. Quirky answers are fine!)"
Receving payment for an hourly RA position,"So I posted about a month [back](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/dht5lx/wage_expectation_for_a_graduate_hourly_lab/) about an interview going well and have finally received follow up.

I was invited to a meeting with all of the staff, (asked to bring food) where a prospective new lab manager was being brought in to hear about the staff research projects etc. The PI introduced me as a grad student hoping to develop my own project for my capstone and my interest in their research, noting that I would like to be paid (previously discussed the availability of an hourly tech position with the PI).

The meeting went well, but I was told to single out researchers I had an interest in working with. A few awkward anxiety-inducing conversations later, I was asked to help work on a project as an assistant learning from the new PhD brought in. I went out sampling today for about an hour, but I am unsure how to ask about payment moving forward? I want to be as nice as possible but I need to start making money...

Edit: Also do not want to be taken advantage of most importantly."
Paper just rejected (again),"After 3 years of work and super exciting results for our field, my short paper was just rejected for the 6th time. I’m the only grad student between two groups. Friday is not looking good. 

How do you cope with rejection and doubts about your research? 

Edit: thanks for the advice everyone! I think my PI and I just need to get on the same page at this point."
Is co-mentorship harder to maintain?,"Hi. My current PI suggested me to do a co-mentorship since she cannot provide guidance in some perspectives of my project. Generally, shouldn't a co-mentorship be harder to maintain than just having 1 mentor? Is this a sign that maybe I should change lab?

&#x200B;

PS: 1 PI is socially awkward and the other is super busy"
How do you manage multiple projects?,Are there any project management software that you found useful? I am currently involved in three different projects and I have been finding it hard to manage the balance. Any tips/suggestions would be extremely helpful. Thank you!
Just submitted my thesis to my advisor,I don’t know if I want to cry or laugh or both
A bit of a garble about advisors after graduation and a small FYI,"I am 10 months out of grad school. I got out by fighting and clawing against a pretty rough advisor (fighting over edits (that he forgot he did) sabotage (his employees were told to do it) and poor understanding of the data and what we were trying to show (I’d say equal parts naughty here)).  

But I finally did it. It was bad enough that I left my field (but not science!) to find a job. He emailed me several times asking when I was going to publish, but I didn’t answer back. I hate his editing (he doesn’t actually read and then gets made later and makes you rewrite months of work on a whim), he made tons of promises he didn’t even come close to keeping, and then let others sabotage my lab space (not that it was secure enough for micro work in the first place...but that’s my mistake for not fighting it earlier).  He didn’t agree to let me graduate. That was another fight on its own. Luckily for me, every one signed off and I was able to get free. So like I said, rough but done. I did it. (Sorry for the rant, it’s things I can’t quite say to him yet haha)

10 months. Several emails “just checking in” on me unanswered because I am still dealing from the damage done. I have a job in a lab doing things completely unrelated to my field, but damn, money in the bank (seriously it’s still a bit lower then middle class but it’s more then grad school Hahahaha)! 

And then he sends an email letting me know if he doesn’t hear back he’s gonna publish my work (copy/ paste from my thesis) and add me as co-author.... with out input for how my work and data are used?!!

Whaaattt we didn’t even agree on what my data said and now were all the sudden publishing?!? 
Can he do that?!? 

How do I respond? He’s copied two people from my committee as well??? What the heck is going on here? I start to spiral back into the ridiculous unhealthy mindset that I had been healing from away from grad school. Freaking out- typing up really angry responses and deleting them- like over and over seriously not even sure what I am saying.

Then I remembered - I’m not alone!!! I called my undergrad advisor (super great full for ‘em) and said how the heck do I respond????

 He gave me some great advice- 
1. Unless you signed a contract saying he owns your work- he can’t publish your work with out proving he “couldn’t find you”. (I am certain this was his plan since I didn’t respond to his more buddy buddy emails). 
2. Don’t email back in the chain. The other people have a stake in getting the data published- they need to know that you can no longer work with your former advisor due to personal reasons. You can explain what happened to your data with out going into detail. (I didn’t find out about the sabotage until after I graduated when an employee told me about what they were told to do)
3. Call the other people publishing on this paper and ask them what they want to do about it. (Like, do they want to do the edits maybe so I can continue to write? Do they want to be the bridge?) 

I haven’t gotten to call the others yet. And honestly, my husband saw me pacing on the phone and handed me a drink...so I will do that first thing tomorrow. 

I just wanted to remind any one who might be in a similar bad advisor place that your not stuck, they don’t OWN you, and sometimes you might remember you have places you can go to for advice. (Even if it’s just reddit) just get thru the spiral. 

I know this was a bit rant-y, and it seems like it was all rough, but honestly the work was amazing, and I’m so damned proud of it :) I would love to do it forever, and some day I will find something in my field - so keep your head up! 

Long story short- grad school was f’ed up yo. But they don’t own you. Make sure you own your work- respond to emails- and work around the problems. Your not alone, enjoy the journey when you can. 

 Thanks for listening :)  enjoy your banana you filthy heathens 🍌🍌🍌"
How did you ‘make’ it?,"I’m a first year grad student. I’ve had some brief research experience, but it’s mostly been very elementary with me doing a bulk of writing, making and running scripts, and -fleetingly- touching on formulation. All this was during my undergrad. 

Now that I’m taking grad courses (which are reeling in math) and I’m expected to do research, I always find myself thinking WOAH how did they come up with that / how did they even think of that when I read a paper. 

How do you do it? I just can’t find the bridge in the skill gap."
Grant writing - never done it before. Resources appreciated!,"I’m a first year grad student and imposter syndrome is real- I’ve never actually written a grant before. I am applying to a small grant due in the next few weeks but my advisor wants a draft by Sunday because he’s going out of town. Any resources people would recommend for a crash course in writing a good grant application?

This particular grant is internal to my school and each component is <400 words, so very small but I’m stressing myself out a bit since it’s just not a thing I’ve done but it’s generally experience a lot of first year students already seem to have."
To what extent did your supervisor help you write your thesis?,Edit: I know a supervisor isn't supposed to write someone's thesis.
Documenting code... Do you always do it?,"I just started my first semester of grad school doing computational biology. I have joined a lab, and this is really the first time I’ve programmed as more than just a hobbyist. I’ve always been anal about commenting code, but it seems that most people in the lab don’t. 

Also, our PI is always encouraging us to complete as much as possible each week. So, it seems natural to skimp out on comments for the sake of speed. 

Does anyone have advice on how they document code or what impacts undocumented code may have on publishing results?"
Rewriting The Results Description for My Paper,"Hi everyone. I need some pointers. Running into a brick wall here on my paper.

The topic of the post-grad paper i'm working on is  *""Factors Influencing X-Country's Stock Market Performance.""*  (DV)

It is a qualitative research, with the IVs being on *(1) Exchange Rate, (2) Inflation Rate, (3) The US' Stock Market Performance, (4) Crude Oil Price.*

Chapter 1: IntroductionChapter 2: Lit ReviewChapter 3: Research MethodologyChapter 4: Results and DiscussionsChapter 5: Conclusion

I outlined the Results based on Chapter 3's findings. Decided to use the method of ""Causal Mechanism"" through qualitative research method to find if factors are significant or insignificant. What I have done so far in Chapter 4 is to outline the articles i found supporting IV1-4; outline the articles found disputing IV1-4; and justify based on that if it is significant or insignificant to the DV.

My issue now is on Chapter 4 and 5. The supervisor remarked me to rewrite Chapter 4 and 5 due to *no logical data* analysis to present the analysis. The only comments were ""*Rewrite the chapter,*"" and ""*Do a proper job.*"" I'm keeping my self motivated, still. But I don't know how else to present findings for causal mechanisms through qualitative aside from what I am doing now.

I need advise on how can I outline the paper's Chapter 4, to highlight the findings through qualitative method. Or some insight on what's the angle or effective manner for me to present the result of something quantitative in a qualitative manner? I'm just trying to get some ideas here. Any kind of insight would help. Thank you."
Research and writing as an art form,"First year grad student, and while I haven't gotten too heavy in research yet, I've been enjoying it a lot when I've done it for my papers 

I was reading several articles yesterday while researching for my next paper when it hit me that research/writing are like a creative endeavor for me. Might sound strange to some, but I see it all as stitching together bits and pieces to form a larger piece of work; put another way, I'm DJ Shadow and I'm trying to create *Endtroducing...* (an album created entirely out of samples for those of you unfamiliar)

Anyone else take this sort of approach to research and writing?"
Should I follow-up email a 3rd time?,"Hi. I am finding a rotation opportunity in a prof's lab so I shot him a first common type of email with my CV and interests and how I want to talk to her in-person. She then said glad to talk but without giving time. So I followed up and said I have these times available. She replied a bit late and picked a time that had been filled, so I followed up again saying that I still have these times available. However, after 3 days, she didn't reply at all. In this case, how can I keep the conversation so we can meet eventually? Is she mad at me?"
Need Free Software for Interview Coding,Hello people! I am new to this community and starting my thesis just now. Can anyone suggest any software that are free to use for interview coding? Thanks for your help.
History conference abstract,"I need a few tips about writting a history conference abstract. According to my guidelines, I need to explain the topic, methodologies, and historiographic significance. In addition, present any new findings and revisions. My deadline is on January 15, 2020."
Will the research activity during my Master's program seriously impact my PhD or career path?,"## TL;DR
The lab that I'm at now has recently been heavily focused on one specific field of research, and I'm also expected to conduct research activity in that field and squeeze in time to work on things that I personally want to pursue later as a more serious PhD student and possible career. Will my research being heavily focused in an irrelevant area impact my future prospects of applying to PhD programs?

## Long version
I'm currently enrolled in a Master's/PhD integrated program at a Korean University. The lab that I'm at does AI/deep learning research. My personal interests lie in computational linguistics, and I made it clear to my advisor that it's what I want to pursue and I wanted to work with those in the field at his lab, which he was happy to hear. I also told him that I have plans to complete my Master's here and go for a PhD to the US. He recommended that I finish my PhD here and go for a postdoc abroad, but that he's also ""more than happy to let me go if it's what you want.""

Recently, he's really taken a ""passion"" into this thing called ""AI-driven drug discovery,"" where you're basically using deep learning techniques to find which chemical compounds may potentially become new drug components. It's interesting and important for sure, but it's not really what I had in mind when I first came to the lab or what I imagined to be doing later in life.

The fact that 1) I'm fluent in English, and 2) I'm ""technically enrolled in a PhD program"" and so will be at the lab longer than regular Master's program students has caused my professor to take a liking to me and him and other senior lab mates have really urged me to at least take a look into the field of bioinformatics. I thought ""what the hell, I'll give it a try and if it's not for me then I'll talk to my advisor and back out."" It is a bit naive of me to think that backing out of research I've been engaged in will be easy.

I've talked to other seniors at the lab about my concerns, and they all understand where I'm coming from and advise me to ""do the bare minimum to keep me out of trouble"" while spending all my time and resources doing research in things I want to and prepare for applying to PhD programs abroad (publishing papers, attending seminars and conferences, etc.)

I'm still a bit concerned though, as bioinformatics is a little distant from computational linguistics. My undergraduate degree wasn't even from a STEM field or linguistics either (international relations major and computer science double major). Has anyone either been down this road, or seen anyone go down it? From a professor who's seeing my application as a potential PhD candidate, how would it look if much of my prior research is in bioinformatics when it says I want to do PhD-level research in computational linguistics?

Any tips or advice are greatly appreciated. Thanks."
"Just told we might not be paid for a month or longer, but still expected to perform all contract duties. Anyone else dealing with this?","The word came down from the dean's office today that our usual RA/TA contracts might not come until mid July at the earliest. However, we still must preform the duties in the contracts we don't have. I know some of us could hold out on savings, but they gave no end date or even a possible date of when we would get them. I know I can't just survive off of papers alone. Is anyone else's university doing this? How did you handle it?"
How do you survive grad school financially?,"I plan on applying to grad schools this fall, but I have a looming concern on my mind: how do grad students make money to pay for all their expenses (rent, food, car, etc.) and still have time to do school?"
Won't be recieving financial aid and I feel like I'm drowning,"Everything just sucks right now. I'm sure a lot of people feel pretty bad too.

Unlike most people who've finished their Spring semester, my quarter's finals week begins today. And I was hit with the news this morning that I most likely didn't receive any state grants for my MA next year because the funding ran out. And I'm crying and I'm livid. 

I'm a disabled, low-income student that lives away from home because, well, I don't have a home to go back to anyways. I rely on school employment, which is historically unreliable, to help pay bills because of my disability. To find out this information is such a blow. I hold a 4.0 GPA. I've won college-wide awards. I've dontated hundreds of hours of service to my school. And now I'll have to go further into debt to both pay my tuition and my bills.

What's even more maddening is this happened because I made a numerical mistake on my FAFSA, which took the office four weeks (for some reason) to adjust. However, they notified me late March despite saying that this issue came to their attention early February. Before the virus. So I could have had this issue handled BEFORE covid-19 hit, if they had bothered to notify me?

And now the money is out. I'm not even in a PhD program yet. Applications next year are going to bleed me dry. And all I want to do is cry because I have two papers and two finals due within the next four days and I can't handle being so fucking poor anymore."
What do you pay per month for health insurance?,"I'm turning the dreaded 26 and will have to come off my parent's insurance so I'm shopping around and trying to find reasonable rates. 

What do you guys pay? Did you go with your school's plan or find your own?"
How common is it to not have health insurance provided?,"I will be starting at an R1 (albeit barely) graduate STEM program this fall (in the US). I also got a GRFP, but they are making me reserve it for the first year because teaching is required. They are paying me roughly $1900/month for the very specific 19 hours of work a week. This does not cover any health insurance or school fees outside of tuition. There is a $160/month extra thanks to the grad student union on campus, but that's not much.

I probably could've gone to a better program, but this is my dream research working with a PI who has close ties to my current boss/work and so I am really looking forward to it. I also was unable to choose the classes I will be taking. Overall I'm pretty annoyed with how poor the financial situation is, but from my postdoc friends this is pretty normal. I'm lucky to have parents who can support me this first year and help supplement my income, but it infuriates me that so many students who aren't as lucky, and even work their asses off to get their own funding still have to deal with this. 

What's the situation at your university? I'm considering joining the student union ASAP and helping fight for insurance. Is it common for it to be paid for?"
"Already accepted one offer of MS with no funding, but a second school just offered me MS + scholarship --- what do I do? Is it wrong to double back on an acceptance?","So in April I was offered an MS in Robotics Engineering at WPI, no funding, with a decision deadline of April 30th. Of the 2 other schools I applied to, 1 had rejected me by April 30th, and the other hadn't sent me a decision by April 30th - so I assumed that was the best I was going to get, and I accepted the offer.

A bit after the deadline, NEU accepted me to their MS in Robotics program, but it was too late. Further, the total cost of NEU (tuition + housing) was looking like it would be about $20k more than WPI - a bit too steep for me to consider doubling back.

But then today NEU sent me a letter saying I was awarded a substantial scholarship. Now its looking like the total cost of NEU is going to be a $5-10k less than WPI, depending on housing expenses.

---

Some questions:

Is doubling back on accepting an offer bad? Am I massively burning bridges or raising red flags or anything here?

In my own financial interest, is it possible to use this offer from NEU to ""haggle"" with WPI, especially since there's like a $25k difference in tuition? Or is that idea just as fucking stupid as it sounds?

Are there other considerations I should make in regards to this decision?

* I've looked extensively at the curriculum of both programs, and it seems like the stuff I want to study (computer vision) has similar levels of support at both schools.

* Since I'm going for MS in order to transition from one professional field to another (from radar EE to computer vision CS), I'm not sure how much weight I should put into evaluations of professors and labs and research and such

* Also since I already have a few years of professional experience, I already have a life in Boston. I wouldn't mind Worcester, really, but most of my friends are in Boston, I've become used to living here, and I think I would be a little sad to leave knowing I had the option to stay.

* NEU's Co-Op program + summer internships also could provide financial income to cover even more of the cost that I'm not sure I could cover while at WPI.

Really any advice would be appreciated."
Better to take longer with less debt or finish more quickly and earn more?,"I’m starting an online MPA program this fall. I’m planning on working full time while I do it, but I can’t decide if I should do FT or PT school. My income is low enough that I’ll still need loans to cover the actual tuition, but if I do PT and take 1 course/ semester then I’ll cut the end amount of debt almost in half. I can’t decide if it’s worth it, though, since that would mean spending more than double the time on the degree, but with way less debt (and probably stress). Does anyone have experience with this internal debate?"

Either way is free with funding from my program. One is alone whereas one allows more saving per month."
ROI of a Business Analytics Masters in Europe?,"I want to do a M. Sc. in Business Analytics (data analysis, forecasting, database maagement, etc.) in Europe, but I don't know how which university to choose, given that some seem really good, last for 1 year (e.g. Vrije Universitat Amsterdam) and are very cheap (2k Euros), but others are top schools (e.g. ESADE) and charge 30k+ Euros for 2 years.

I've seen videos and articles where people sort of rank universities in the US based on ROI. That is, it isn't really worth it, on average, to go to Harvard, given that you would not earn much more than a Boston University graduate, for example.

How can I evaluate the ROI for universities in Europe, given that there are so many prestigious ones and which vary so much in price?"

Help with choosing schools! USC vs CSU Northridge,"Hi everyone!

I was accepted for Fall 2020 to multiple programs for a 2-year MS in Health Administration. I am currently choosing between CSU Northridge and USC (University of Southern California). The schools are equally accredited by CAHME and both have great post-graduate employment rates.

I am holding back from accepting USC due to the cost. I would have to take out about $90,000 in federal unsubsidized loans at about a 6% interest rate. At CSU Northridge I would require NO loans and am being given $6000 in grants a year for a total of $12000. The degree would cost me under $10,000 easily.

Is the prestige of USC worth the student loan debt? How has your personal experience with student loans been?

I am the first in my family to go to graduate school and earn an undergraduate degree so I do not have much help and opinions for discussing the long terms effects of paying off loans.

I am 23 and with no undergraduate debt, also.

Thank you for the advice."
Post-Recession (2008) Grad School. What was it like?,"Anyone here who attended grad school from 2009 and onwards.

How can I increase my income as an intl graduate student in Texas?,"I'm an international student, and I'm starting my neuroscience PhD at UT this fall.

I have a reasonable stipend with tuition covered. I have maybe 300-500$ leftover each month after accounting for the necessities (lodging, food, insurance, taxes).

As fellowships and grants for international students are few, what can I do to supplement my income by $500-$1k? Does TA-ing work? Are there bond-free/non-repayable fellowships that I can apply for?

Thanks!"
What should I do next?,"Hey y’all, 

So today I found out the Graduate Assistantship of my dreams turned me down, not sure if it’s because of budgetary reasons or they hired someone else. The majority of GAships I’ve found are already filled or can’t be filled due to budget, and I’m getting really nervous about paying for my Master’s. My program is Public Policy and this is the very first year for the program at my university. 

I’m really at a loss of what to try now, I was really hoping for the tuition waiver a GA position could offer, but now I’m losing hope that I’ll find one. I have degrees in Political Science and Legal Studies, and I’m not sure how likely it is I can get a job in that field given the state of the economy for the foreseeable future. 

Do y’all have any advice on where I should start looking next or what my next steps should be to try to get funding?"
Are Graduate Assistantships Feasible For A Masters Student?,"I just finished my undergrad, completing a double major in math and physics. I am taking a gap year to continue to work for a professor. I am considering going to grad school for a master's in applied math or computer science.

But geez school is expensive. Ideally I would like to obtain a graduate assistantship which would waive tuition. I've considered pursuing a PhD, but the stress of 4-6 more years of school does not appeal to me, especially when I don't have extremely clear goals when it comes to what I would want to research. I was just wondering, how often are Graduate Assistantships offered to masters students? All the information I can find online tends to be geared towards PhD students. Is it something that I can count on getting if I base my choice in school on it? Is it something not commonly offered because grad schools aren't willing, or because most students don't want to do it?"
I worked 5 jobs last year. I made a total of 26k,"My 2019 was consumed by side hustles I needed to supplement my below-living-wage PhD stipend while working on my dissertation. I had no social life, my relationship were strained because I was working all the time. Last night I imported the four W-2 forms and one 1099 form representing my 2019 income and my AGI was just over $26,000. I budget carefully and have been able to make ends meet, barely.  But now, reflecting back on last year, I'm really pissed off that I have worked SO hard and for so long and have little to show for it. I'm not even getting a tax refund because my non-compensatory income is more than my qualified educational expenses and one of my gigs was an IC job I still have to pay taxes on. I'm so sick of this, I've been below the poverty line for 6 years now despite having many skills and working my ass off."
How available is need-based financial aid for Master's of Public Health programs in the US?,"I've been comparing tuition rates for MPH programs across the US, and they range from about $22k/year for in-state at a public school to more than $60k/year for out-of-state or private schools (among schools in the top 15 nationally). There are some 1-year programs (e.g. the MPH-45 at Harvard), but most are two years. I recently moved to California and would qualify for residency here before I apply next year. I've also thought about moving back home to Washington State before applying to the UW. 

At this point I can only compare the sticker price of these programs since I don't know how much financial aid I might receive. I'm just wondering if need-based aid is something I should remotely hope to be offered. I know some schools (e.g. UC Berkeley) do not provide any need-based aid, but others have it listed on their websites. I'm starting to reach out to the offices of financial aid at different schools to determine their procedures for calculating need-based aid, but I'm wondering if anyone who has gone through the application process can speak to whether any schools offered them substantive need-based aid. This may impact how I decide to allocate my financial assets (e.g. if there is a likelihood of receiving need-based aid, I may put more savings into my retirement accounts since they are nonreportable on the FAFSA). 

Thanks for the help!"
"Money, loans, tuition advice","Hi everyone! I will begin a doctorate program this fall and I am just overwhelmed with dealing with the anticipated costs of everything. I received my financial aid information today and I will only be getting loans.

Breakdown of what I'm paying for in Tuition,"I am an out of state grad student. For the most part, I've been using loans/scholarships to pay for school. On my account summary, it has the cost of tuition, non tuition, and misc charges like parking permits, citations, program fees, etc... I am wanting to know what the charge of my tuition entails. For all the non-tuition charges, I know exactly what I am being charged for (parking, school fee, citations, etc...). I would like to know what falls under tuition to make-up that charge."
"Hiring freeze, funding and the pandemic.","Background: I just finished up the first year of my MS in Biomedical Engineering. My program is set up so that the first year is all coursework and unfunded and the second thesis year is all research and funded by your advisor. 
I identified an advisor and have spent the first year working (for course credit) in their lab to “prove” myself before they’d take me on for my thesis  year. I confirmed that they’d have funding and would take me on for the second year a few weeks ago. 

Problem: In filling out the necessary paperwork, the advisor found out that the university wide hiring freeze means students can only be hired if their stipend/tuition award will be covered under a previously awarded external funding source. My advisor has applied for an external grant but is unsure that it will be awarded this year because of the financial impact of the pandemic. As a backup, they had planned to use the department’s discretionary fund, but learned that it is also likely to be cut. 

Question: My goal in completing this MS is to prepare myself to apply for MD/PhD programs in biomedical engineering. I have four years of research in undergrad with one publication and numerous conference presentations, but not in BME. Will finishing out this MS without a thesis look bad, or should I shell out an extra $45,000 to pay for the second year myself? Are there other options I haven’t thought of?"
How did you pay for your masters program/grad school? (Trying to figure out how to fund this!),"I'm entering a masters program this fall, and was planning to pay for it through a merit scholarship from my school and a contribution from my parents. Unfortunately, coronavirus seriously affected my family, and I'm now realizing that I do not want to rely on my parents for basically any contribution.

I was wondering how you paid for your masters/grad program- did you go through Grad Plus loans or private loans? I'm looking to take out $40-50k to cover the whole program cost. I'm turning 25, so I would apply without my parents' financial information.

Any advice would be really appreciated."

Question about Loans for grad school,"I’m starting grad school for the first time in the fall and will be attending full time. I’m hoping to revive an assistantship position which will cover nearly all of my tuition and a stipend. I don’t know how much this stipend will be. In your experiences, have stipends been enough to live on or would I need to take out student loans? If I need to take out federal loans, how do I go about doing that? In undergrad the financial aid office basically just did it for me so I have no clue how to go about it or how much I’ll need. I’m hs I g a hard time finding an apartment not knowing how much money I’ll have!"
Does anyone know anything about GA jobs and unemployment?,"Long story short: I graduated with my masters Saturday. Friday was my last day of employment as a GA on campus. I didn’t work any other jobs while in school for two years. My hours had been majorly reduced when the pandemic hit, but now I’m officially unemployed. 

I revived a grant that requires me to work for my state in child welfare for two years to “pay off” my schooling. Well, clearly hiring is on the back burner right now. So that leaves me waiting and waiting to hear back with no other job. 

I applied for unemployment, but I’m getting a sense that most states won’t accept my GA gig as work. Does anyone know much about this? I applied for a $500 one-time CARES grant with my school, but I’m afraid that’s all the assistance I’ll get."
How hard is it to live in/near Central LA on my PhD stipend?,"I recently got in to USC for a PhD program. My funding package comprises of a $32k yearly stipend (before taxes) + tuition + insurance.

1) Will it be possible for me to rent a single occupancy room and not be net cash-flow negative? I don't mind staying away from the campus as long as there is metro connectivity.
2) What are the cheaper (but not shady) areas of town? I've heard of Koreatown and Crenshaw. 
3) How's the bicycle scene in and around central LA?

I'm not completely averse to the idea of a roommate, but I'd prefer to stay alone if possible.

When did your PI tell you if you’re getting a stipend or not?,I’ve just been accepted into the grad program I want to attend. I’ve known my PI for a while and have done research from them. I don’t just want to straight up ask if I’m getting a stipend or not but I want to start thinking how I will finance everything because I have to move out of my parents house.

Sorry, I'm just not quite sure what this step entails."
Rent/Stipend ratio?,"Hi all,

I'm moving to Atlanta this Fall to start my PhD journey, but so far all of the financial stuffs for the next five years are driving me mad lol. My stipend is relatively good (36k/year, so 2k5/month post-tax), but Atlanta is getting much more expensive than I remember it to be. I wonder if spending 1k3-1k5 for rent (excluding other bills) out of a 2k5 pay would be too much? My SO is looking for a job in Atlanta as well so we won't have to worry about this if that works out, but she's an international student, so the options are limited."

Average funding for MSc STEM students in Canada?,"I’ve got 2/3 acceptances so far from the schools I’ve applied to, with funding from both of them. 

One is potentially significantly more than the other (I was nominated for a prestigious entrance award worth $10k, but the results won’t come in until later). But in order to make sense of the lower offer, I’m hoping to get some context for how much is “good” when it comes to MSc funding in Canada (especially in STEM)? I’m more on the CS / math / physics side of the acronym, if that makes a difference. 

I‘m not close with anyone who has done an MSc in STEM recently, so I don’t have anyone to talk to about funding with irl. 

Further potentially relevant info: the lower offer is at my first choice school, which is in a higher cost of living city. I’ve also applied for NSERC at all 3 schools, but won’t know about that until April; I think I’m more likely to get NSERC at the school that’s already offered me more (just based on number of awards / students at each school)."

Scholarship taken away mid-semester (Did nothing wrong) - Can they do this and what are my options?," 

**Hello y'all, I hope things are going better for you right now. I am little depressed for some help and advice. I am currently a grad student, and during the mid-semester, I just found out through my payment portal that I'm getting charged about $20 Grand out of nowhere and they removed my scholarship and loans. I am currently against the wall right now. I can't pay for that and it is happening during the middle of the semester! I don't know why! I am planning to go to my financial aid, but I want to know my options before I walk in before they blindside me with some explanation. Is any chance for me to get my scholarship back? Plus, can a university do this legally? Take away a scholarship mid-semester? They probably can but I just want to be sure. Thank you!**


Edit: I just want to thank everyone for the support but unfortunately I just spoke to financial aid and it’s the worst news ever. It wasn’t a mistake and in fact, the mistake was me having the scholarship. The scholarship was for undergrad only and since I’m a grad student, they remove it mid-semester without telling me. It seems like I’m completely struck now. With no way to get out. I’m completely out of options and don’t know what to do. Thank you for your help though. I appreciate it."
Health insurance,"Hi everyone,

For 2019-2020 I applied to a few grad schools and received a few offers for PhD programs. One is really tempting and the program seems really good but only issue that is keeping me from accepting the offer is that  it doesn’t have health insurance. I checked their website and they do not even have subsidized health insurance at all for any graduated students. Is this a good sign for the program and how do people people survive without health insurance?"

Managing finances as PhD?,"I’m a first year PhD student and am wondering how others manage their finances: I’m currently on a 1 year fellowship and waiting to hear back about 3 year fellowships that would start up next year. Regardless, my advisor has grants so I’ll be funded for the foreseeable future, which means income security is pretty high compared to being an at-will employee at some company. This makes me feel like I can take on a little more risk with my growing savings, namely moving some of my money out of HYSA now that I have 6+ months expenses as an emergency fund. Also not planning for anything big - live in a metro area so no car, no plans on putting money down on a house, etc. 

My monthly expenses are only about 60% of income, so I feel like my monthly residual will start growing quickly. Given there’s no 401k program for grad students (at least where I’m at), how are you managing your savings? IRA, standard investing, or safer asset classes?"
Let’s talk debt,"How much debt is manageable for a lucrative career that you love? I enrolled in a private masters program (only one in the area my husband works at, non-negotiable) and we are young, frugal, and have no kids. I have worked so hard for this and plan to pay off student loans as fast as possible. No other debt for either of us and he covers our living expenses. Anyone else have similar circumstances and come out on the other side? Hoping for some positivity or advice, I know that debt can be crippling but I know there’s also lots of people that have buckled down and paid off loans years early."
Leaving underemployed job with benefits for graduate school.,"I’m currently enrolled as a full-time student at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism for Fall 2020. I currently have excellent Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield coverage through my job as a teaching assistant. Once I leave, I will not have health insurance unless I pay the astronomical amount for KOBRA. Newmark J-School doesn’t currently offer its student’s health insurance. 

I’ve gotten a lot of advice that I would qualify for Medicaid. However, I only made $23, 707 last year according to my 1040 and will have made roughly half of that once I resign this year. This would put me above the bracket for Medicaid. After doing research through NYS Marketplace, I learned about the NYS Essential Plan that I feel like I’d qualify for. When I reached out to healthcare.gov and the NYS Health site to talk about options, they said that they would only be able to see what I qualify for once I lose coverage.

Does anybody have any suggestions or know about qualifications for the NYS Essential Plan?"
What does a GA position entail financially?,"Hi! I recently got accepted at BU, which is my top choice and is also a very expensive private university.

How much of stipend to spend on housing?,"I am actually coming over from the world of r/medschool (lol don't kick me out). I am in a bit of an unusual situation for medical school and was hoping y'all could give me some advice.

I am super fortunate to have gotten accepted to a med school that is a) tuition free and b) offering a pretty generous stipend for living expenses. For those of you that may not be familiar, this is extremely rare in the med school world and I am a bit over my head with the idea of actually having to figure out a budget rather than just going 150K in debt.

I guess I am just wondering if there are any commonly used guidelines for figuring out how to budget in grad school. I know the ""adult rule"" is \~30% of income on housing, \~20% savings, \~50% needs and wants, but I'm not sure if that really applies here since I was not planning on saving a single cent during medical school on account of the whole loan thing. I want to be financially responsible, of course, but I'd also reallllyyyyy love to live alone, which would of course be $$$.

Anyways, any insight/advice is super welcome!

EDIT: Will be outside of LA, where COL is obviously not cheap"
What's the difference between a fellowship and an RA/TA position?,I was recommended to apply for a fellowship by a potential grad program I'm applying to even though there should be funding for an assistantship. What's the difference between an assistantship position and a fellowship? Is there a potential reason I was told to apply to the fellowship even though there should be funding?
Is an iPad (or similar device) worth what it’ll cost as a PhD student?,"I currently have a mid-range Dell laptop (RIP my MacBook Pro, how I miss you) that works fine but is large, heavy, and difficult to transport. I’ve been thinking about getting an iPad for reading and annotating papers for research/working on my dissertation prospectus on the go. I just can’t decide if it’s worth the cost. 

I have students and colleagues who swear by the iPad Pro, but at what it’ll cost me, it almost seems like it’d be better to save up a little longer and get a MacBook again. The iPad Mini seems attractive though for its smaller size but good specs. The plain iPad would be the budget choice of course, but I don’t know if it would be sufficient. 

What do you all think? Do you use tablets on the day to day in grad school/academia?

Edit: I’m a literature PhD student for what that’s worth 

TL;DR - I’m considering getting a tablet to use in conjunction with my ungainly (but functional) laptop for grad school and can’t decide if it’s worth the cost.

Edit 2: Thank you all SO MUCH for the great advice! This is exactly what I needed - the perspective of fellow grad students 😊"
International Grad to the US,"Hello! I was accepted to a grad school doctoral program in NY State, but have not received notification of an assistantship. I'm worried that I won't get one, and I won't be able to afford tuition (for I-20 purposes, I'd need to show I have the full amount in my account - I don't). 

I'm hoping to start in Fall 2020.

I realise time is not on my side, and this is likely a stupid question, but can anyone recommend good resources for grad school funding?

Full time job vs Graduate Assistantship,"I have been accepted to a Masters program at my alma mater. Recently they had a preview day for incoming students, so I got to meet people who are in the program and who have graduated. They have all done assistantships. It’s a 36 credit program and the assistantship waives 16 credits per year, so it’s actually really good. However, you have to be a full time student to do the assistantship. 

Now to me. I work a full time 9-5 job but they are very flexible and laid back, so I know I could do some school work there. I’d love to do the assistantship but I can’t afford it. All of them pay $10.42 an hour and work 25 hours a week. I have rent, bills, a car payment, and I need health insurance. 

So should I go part time school and full time work? Or should I do my first year part time, save up money, and do the assistantship the next year?"
How much did you have saved for grad school?,"I got accepted to my top grad school in the Spring! I deferred my acceptance for a year solely to save money. I’m starting in Fall 2020 now and I’m obsessing over nickel and diming everything I do. By the time I move I will probably have anywhere from 10-15k saved but I feel like it’s not enough. Mostly I think I need a little validation. I’ll have to pay for tuition as well as housing... moving costs to a new state... it’s a lot to think about. 

How much did you save before grad school? Was it enough? How much do you wish you saved? Etc etc."
Anyone else struggle with being waitlisted for funding?,"Got into my top choice (school I'm currently attending for my MA) and my advisor told me I'm high on the waitlist for funding and it could be until mid-April when I'll know if I got money or not.

Anyone else struggle through this? I am so happy I got into a PhD program but without money I can't go. I feel so deflated."
How to pay for grad school?,"Well, it happened! I got accepted into my dream school (osu) for my dream program (epidemiology)! Now, a new type of anxiousness has set in. How does financial aid work in grad school? For undergrad, I got a lot of government assistance because I come from a fairly poor family (I got the Ohio Pell grant, specifically), but moving ahead, I know a lot of my scholarships and government grants were only for an undergraduate degree. I'm starting to think I can't just close my eyes and accept the loans and be done with it lol. I am currently out of money and grad school is coming quick. 

How do you all afford it (besides just applying for scholarships)? Is there government assistance? Is it different than undergrad? Do I have to bank on getting into an assistantship?"
What is your favorite search tool for scholarships/grants/fellowships?,"Hello friends!

So I've been out of undergrad for about three years, and I have wanted to go to graduate school for a long time but I've been reluctant to leave my job and its steady income. I applied as a non-degree student for this coming fall so that if I did decide to quit, I could have the option to start taking classes in August while I work on my full application. Today things really started hitting the fan at work and I had to be like, yeah, okay, I have to get outta dodge ASAP. I plan to quit at the end of June, or maybe a couple of months earlier if things continue to be horribly mismanaged.

I just sat down and ran the numbers on how much it would cost me over two years with tuition and living without an income, which then led me to discover that it seems like no one wants to fund masters degree students. My school has some fellowship and graduate assistantship opportunities, but I've spoken with the financial aid office and it sounds like they're almost always swept up by incoming fall students. I'm fine with just paying sticker price for my first semester as a non-degree student, but since I would technically be starting in spring I'm trying to find whatever sources I can so that I can be ready when I'm submitting my full application.

Masters students in particular, but others if you have good resources, what's the best search tools or listings you know of that show you good funding opportunities and applications? I'd rather stay away from loans if possible. I signed up for the Sallie Mae scholarship search tool thing but I'm wondering if there's any insider resources to be had. I'm looking to study history, if that affects anything. Thank you!"
How much in fees aren’t covered by tuition waivers?,"Have a full tuition waiver and a stipend, but still had to pay almost $1000 in tuition fees.. is this normal?

Asked a person with accounting at my school and they said yes but I’m not sure that they actually understood what I was asking. 3 semesters with fees like that takes away over 10% of the yearly income I get from the program so would like to know if this is normal or not."
Funding for masters degree,"Hi, I’m currently a PhD student in mechanical engineering. I just finished up my first semester, but I’m considering switching from the PhD program to the masters program at the same school. If I do this, I may lose funding and have to pay my way through the  rest of the masters (most likely one year). I’m at an expensive school, so I would hope to find some ways to ease the financial burden.

Does anyone know of any good places to look for fellowship, scholarships, or any source of funding? Any advice would help"
Grad school under reporting costs by $8k+,"I’m in a competitive medical program that requires a certain amount of clinical/immersion hours. The program itself is fairly expensive and many of us are using a combination of traditional loans to pay for the courses and grad plus loans to help supplement our income and pay for living expenses etc as it is nearly impossible to work full time and maintain the grade point average required to stay in the program.  Our financial aid also does not include our summer courses even though the amount of courses over the summer is considered full time by federal guidelines (over 6 credits considered full time and our summer courses average 9-10.) I spoke with financial aid about the summer courses and they had no idea that the traditional loans don’t cover them.

We just had a meeting to discuss the process of signing up for and paying for (!) immersion hours which costs $8,000 and is not covered by financial aid. I think this is unfair and ultimately our school is under reporting the cost of attendance by tens of thousands of dollars per year (including summer course) and doesn’t report this cost for immersion hours. 

This school is in an already expensive state with a high cost of living and state and federal income tax so working part time doesn’t cover all that much in the way of expenses. Lots of hospitals offer something in the way do education costs but it is not competitive and many offer less than $2k per year (less if you’re full time.)

I’m trying to figure out what my best course of action is.  The vast majority of us in the program are taking out loans but they basically don’t cover the cost of tuition because the school isn’t reporting accurately. 

Has anyone dealt with the situation or just have advice in moving forward?"
"Folks who started working after undergrad and went back to grad school, how did you make it work going from making middle class salary to $20k/yr stipend?","Guys, 

&#x200B;

I'm a month and a half out of undergrad (BSME) and am working an okay job while thinking about going back to grad school every day.  I come from a not so wealthy family and struggled financially throughout undergrad even with help from family. This is the first time in my life I've had two pennies to rub together and I don't think I can pull off living off of $20k/yr on my own. 

&#x200B;

So, folks who went back to school after working for a while -- how does one accomplish that without risking financial disaster? Sure student loans are an option but I'm really trying to avoid that trap. Is it passive income through real estate investments? Fellowships & scholarships on top of stipend? Royalties from stuff you worked on while making salary?

TIA for your input!"

How did you go about applying for student loans and what's a good interest rate?," I'm planning on attending graduate school in Europe and will not receive much financial aid at all. Im looking at different options to pay for graduate school and am thinking that a student loan would be the best way to pay for it.

Scholarships/grants for Professionals/Part Time Students,"Hello All! 

So I am thinking about starting graduate school very soon. I'll be going for a Masters in Systems Engineering. 

My company does pay up front for classes for degrees. However they recently changed the policy and the amount they will support. With the new financial cap from the company it would only cover enough for me to take 2 classes per year, if I go to the university of my choice. Personally that's not ideal for me because it would take me about 5 years to finish the program. Then I would owe the company 2 years after that. I would like to take at least 2 classes a semester which would be 4 classes a year. 

Of course I am looking into programs that are a more affordable but I was wondering if anyone knew of any scholarships or grants or programs that will support part time professional students. That would help a lot to cover the extra cost so I can finish my program in a decent time frame. 

Thanks in advance for the help!"
Applying for a MS while married and with a 7 months old boy,"Hello, right now I am in an entry level position in the medical device industry. I get next to nothing and it would take me a long time like 5+ years for me to be a salaried employee (associate scientist and above) in my line of work. Going to grad school would make sense for me to be able to advance in the future. 
I have a BS in biochemistry. 
I’m interested in grad school but my question is how do people pay for life expenses while married with a baby and no job since grad school is essentially their job until they finish.

SUNY Students - Huge Dilemma IS Tuition,"Hi everyone

I'm an incoming SUNY student. I lived in NY for a number of years and am a NY resident. However, the school requires me to show continued presence for 12 months up to the start of school. The issue is my lease in NY ends in Feb 2020 and I don't plan to move for school until June or July 2020. I planned the few months in between to be spent crashing at friend's and family's to save some money. I realize now that this could present an issue with IS tuition. 

&#x200B;

Is there any solution to this? The only solution I can think of is getting an extension of my lease which is unlikely given I'm in NYC. Or finding a shor term 6 month lease or something where I currently am and then move into school once that short term runs out. Both options are expensive but I don't see an alternative."
My stipend just got cut by 7K and I don't know what to do...,"Title pretty much says it all but I found out today my stipend is going to take a dramatic hit. I already left a 40K a year job (in a unrelated field) to come to grad school... How the hell am I supposed to tell my fiance that now I wont even be making enough to cover my loans anymore?! I just feel hopeless and am honestly thinking of telling my advisors I just cant make ends meet with 19K a year... and leaving the program. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Has anyone left because the money got cut? Any advice would be appreciated.

College ring in grad school,"So I got an email that I qualify for getting a LSU ring because I have completed 18 credits thus far as a grad student. I’m going to get my PhD in the same place, but it feels, sketchy, you know? Like I have a college ring from my undergrad because I was a double major and overcame a lot of personal traumatic issues. This feels like a cash grab.

However I would like to commemorate in some way that is less gaudy.

Thoughts? Advice"
How do you survive with the stipend?,"Just curious, the stipend/TA is generally enough but in some cases its barely cutting it out for families. What are the ways you make something extra on the side for the living since a PhD is more of a full-time (24/7) job? (specially those who are F1-students)"
Spending money to attend a conference,"What are your thoughts on attending a conference that I have to spend a good chunk of my own money to attend (likely ~$600-700)? Our department provides $500 to first year grad students to attend a conference without needing to present a poster, but this particular conference is really expensive because it’s held at a retreat center (which also means lodging and meals are included for the 3 day conference).

Thoughts? 

It does sound both personally and professionally enjoyable- the schedule includes time for a hike and an evening fire under the stars :) Also my advisor will be there and it’s a pretty small conference (~130 people) so I could meet a lot of relevant people in the field. 

It takes place in early-mid November, so I have not found any options for additional funding with that short of a turnaround time :("
How much do you budget per month for food?,"I'm starting grad school this fall, full-time on an assistantship (after several years working full-time), so my income will be considerably lower. Rent will eat up a chunk of my pay, so I'm trying to get an idea now of how much I should be budgeting for everything. I don't live a lavish lifestyle or anything close to it, don't eat out much, not a partier/drinker, etc

Just trying to get an idea of how other people budget. Any advice is welcome"
Grad Student Stipend Spreadsheet?,"Hello, I remember seeing a google spreadsheet on here comparing the graduate student stipends across the US, and also listing the fees, health insurance costs, etc., but for the life of me I cannot find it again.

Being taxed on tuition waiver,"Hey folks.

Is anyone else being taxed on their tuition waiver? I get 1000 a month and 300 of that goes to taxes because they also tax the tuition waiver. So we get taxed like we’re making 2000 instead of 1000. They spread it out so it doesn’t hit all at once, but it’s insane. I remember seeing this in the news that they were considering taxing waivers like income and that it didn’t pass, so I was pretty upset when my first paycheck came in and it was far less than what I budgeted for. 300 dollars coming out of 1000 is a big deal for me and I didn’t know to prepare for it."
Do grad schools disburse tuition grants evenly each semester?,"I was given a 25% grant when I started grad school. It's my first semester and I noticed that in addition to this semester's 25% grant an additional 33% grant is listed in my bill. I never applied for any scholarships or grants, so this is a surprise.

Is it possible that they are giving me next semester's grant now, or is this a gift?"
Are there any resources to help afford purchasing a new laptop?,"I have a friend who's a fellow graduate student, and the computer he's had for over five years has stopped working completely, but he doesn't have the money to spend a few hundred on a new one.


Are there any places he could turn to for help? I know there are student discounts available with various tech businesses, but it's usually something like 10% off purchases. Are there any sort of grants for necessary technology (we're in a programming-heavy math program, so a working laptop is pretty much mandatory), or student- focused charities, or anything else that could help cover some of the costs of a new purchase? Or a place where he could maybe get some old used laptop? I'd give him my old one, but it's in such bad shape it can't even go online anymore. He's also not a U.S. citizen, so I don't know if that could help in some way."
Question about how in-school deferment actually works,"So I’ve been researching how in-school deferment works and after looking all over what resources I can find I still can’t figure out a few things. For starters, it looks like services and the government use a database that gets updated by schools, but it only shows you enrolled for the current semester. 

My core question is, when I’m in grad school do I need a new deferment for every semester? Or will it continuously extend somehow? Ngl the prospect of my loans capitalizing every 3 months is pretty gross to think about

Thanks!"
Are assistantships taxed the same as a normal salary/wage?,"Potentially dumb question, but just wondering as I get ready to start grad school. I know how much I'll make pre-tax, just trying to get an idea of how much I should expect to get taken out"
Can I ask an employer to give me a salary instead of a tuition waiver? (probably a stupid question),"Edit: yo guys I'm well aware this isn't the best question, downvoting doesn't help 🙃

I know this is probably dependent on the university, but most of the people on my university subreddit are undergrads so I can't ask there

When I was admitted, I was awarded a tuition waiver by my department. Part of the stipulation of the waiver is that if I get a waiver-generating appointment, the department waiver would be void. Because of this, I've just been applying to part-time jobs instead of graduate assistant positions. I applied to this part-time job I really liked a few days ago but I'm preparing my backups just in case I don't get this part-time job.

I looked at the assistantship job board again and saw one that's still posted that I think I'm qualified for. However, they award a tuition waiver. Say I apply to this assistantship and I get it, would it be ludicrous to ask the employer to give me a salary in lieu of a tuition waiver since I don't need a tuition waiver? I just want something that'll help me offset the cost of rent and groceries 😭 again sorry if this is a stupid question, I'm first generation and my only friends that are in grad school are first-years like me, so they wouldn't know the answer to this"
Living on PhD stipend?,"I'm a Master's student but I'd like to consider going for a PhD, but I'm concerned about living on so little for so long. I know it shouldn't be about the money (and it isn't) but 25k a year for ~5-6 years just seems like relatively nothing. 

I should say I'll have quite a bit of debt after I get my MA (nothing from undergrad thankfully), and it's not like I have to live a particularly lavish lifestyle, but what worries me is needing emergency funds and not having them, or not being able to save up for the future until after I graduate. I know some of the other PhDs in my area have rented houses together and this isn't a cheap area but it's not like I ask them how their 401ks are doing either.

So my question is what's it like living on a stipend for a good part of your young-adult life? Are you pay-check to pay-check, or are you able to save a little rainy day money? And if you've graduated what are your savings like now?"
Jobs that pay for your masters???,"Does anyone know of jobs that help pay for your masters? I recently seen a comment that said they intentionally started working for the school they wanted to go to because it offers reduced tuition for workers. Which makes me wonder if other employees do the same. I know there a few but I think those are generally reserved for getting you bachelor's.


Edit: I want to get an MPP and I am a political science major."
Working in a Masters Program,"Hi everyone,

I’m a first year grad student only hoping to go as far as my masters. I worked two jobs through undergrad and consider my time management and organizational skills are dialed. 

I was fortunate enough to also receive some rare funding for tuition remission based on merit. 

I’m currently working 26 hours a week as a paralegal but I’m drowning in schoolwork. I don’t want to let the school down since I was picked for the funding. It’s also in a program not incredibly related to my undergrad so I’m doing a lot of catch up work on terminology. Not feeling as smart or as pretentious as my classmates. 

Thinking about quitting the job I have since it’s really made for a full time person and trying to scrape by on loan money until I find something for like 10 hours a week. And my current employers were nice enough to make concessions for me but I don’t want to burn that bridge at work since I’ve known them a long time and want to keep that reference. But with all the assignments piling up I’m thinking something has to give. (were on a quarter system btw so everything is crammed short). I feel like when I asked around before people said it’s doable to work about 20-25 hours a week and now I’m feeling like that’s not the case. I’m not even in a STEM program!

Would appreciate anyone’s thoughts on this."
"Complications related to grad school in a new state. I’m a student, fiancé isn’t. Can we both retain residency in old state? Does he have to legally move to new state? What did you guys do?","Moving to Indiana for a master’s (Purdue) from Pennsylvania.  My fiancé is also moving with me, but will not be a student, and we’re trying to work out the complications and implications regarding legal residents. Pennsylvania has lower tax rates than Indiana and they have reciprocity agreements (so we wouldn’t be double taxed). 

Does he have to become a legal resident of Indiana because he isn’t a student?

If he does, would it just be simpler for both of us to be residents of Indiana and pay the slightly higher taxes? 

Related, do car insurance companies allow graduate students to insure cars in one state and register the car in a different state? 

Any and all help/advice is greatly appreciated.

"""We pay you enough""","Recently, I've picked up a part time job to help make ends meet until I move to a new and cheaper place at the end of July. During the last day of classes, I spaced and picked up a shift during the last class I had that semester. Completely my fault, but the class had no final so I wasn't missing a review, and wasn't going to be about any new material so I wasn't missing anything new. A friend of mine said that the prof asked where I was and one of my classmates who thinks before he talks said that I was working. My prof said, in front of the class, ""oooooooo I don't like that, we pay our grad students enough"". While I know for a fact she meant it playfully, it infuriated me to hear this. In fact, the common grad student issue in my department is that we DONT get paid enough. I've been having a really stressful time making this job work with grad school and hearing that just felt like I got kicked while I was down."
Fellowship only covers In-State Resident Tuition; is this the norm?,"I have moved to a new state for a Ph.D program. I was accepted and awarded with a fellowship and a stipend of $24k(USD) per year. This sounded like a great opportunity but now it's time to pay the excess fees and I find out the fellowship only covers the amount for a state resident tuition. Since I've only lived in this state for a month, I'm expected to pay the $3k per semester difference for the non-resident tuition. 

This really surprised me because this detail didn't seem to be mentioned in the emails or in the actual fellowship acceptance letter, my undergrad professors never mentioned this as a downside to going out of state, and I can't find anything online about this being the norm. Is this normal and has anyone else experienced this? Is there any way to argue to have this covered or maybe get the resident rate (as I have moved to this new state, changed my address, and plan to get a state license with the intention of staying)?"
One of my labmates told me that she owes over 170K in student loans,"A friend of mine is going through some hard times that pertain to his student loans, so I was discussing it with one of my labmates. Just casual conversation. Then she off-handedly mentioned that she owes over 170K in loans herself.  I can't stop thinking about it. I'm completely in shock. 

We're in a fully-funded program, but we don't make much stipend-wise and the cost of living is high. That, along with her prior degrees from a private college and some medical issues, brought her to this point. 

I love what I do, but I wouldn't pay that much money for it. We're not even in a high-paying field. How does someone cope with that? Do you just make minimum payments until you die?

[Side note: She said that she doesn't mind if I talk about this with other people because it might spread some awareness, but I won't share any of her personal information (school, age, name, etc.).]

"Is a $12,000/year stipend for PhD reasonable?","Hi all, my question is in the title, but for those of you who'd like more info, please read on.

I finished a M.S. in engineering back in May and I'm taking a year off. Recently, I began applying for jobs and PhD positions. A few days ago, I was talking with a professor at a Canadian university (I'm from the US) who was looking for a PhD student to work on a project that was a perfect fit for my interests and background. I asked what the stipend was, and they told me it was $12,000/year, which they said was ""competitive."" I asked if most PhD students have second jobs, or if there is cheap/free on-campus housing for PhD students, and the prof said no to both.

Now, I had two main issues with that.

* My partner and I were already struggling on $40,000/year (collectively) as master's students, with both of us studying at the same time. If my partner couldn't find a job in Canada, I don't know how we would survive on $12,000/year.
* That's $1,000/month. Basically I'd pay rent, utilities, and groceries, and I'm mostly out of money.

Where I did my bachelor's and master's degrees PhD students are paid around $30,000/year. What is a normal stipend? I can't imagine $12,000/year is livable, but maybe I'm coddled.

ETA: Thanks, all, this has been informative. I'm gonna pass on this opportunity - I was on the fence about going back to school already. I think I'll take a few years off before I go back to get my PhD somewhere that's not this school."
Is Graduate school free?,"My roommate is going to UWM for graduate school. He said the school is paying for his tuition, in addition, to a $13,500 stipend. Plus, he is getting free insurance through the school as well. All from a part-time teaching assistant position that he will work simultaneously with his grad program work. 

&#x200B;

I never thought to go to graduate school because of all the expenses, but is it really that easy? It's making me reconsider my options, if it's free to go.

&#x200B;

For reference: My roommate got into graduate school with a 3.0gpa and average entrance exam scores."
Can you qualify for SSHRC or CIHR writing a Major Research Paper?,"I found a good health policy program. The funding itself is good, but I wanted to know if I qualified for doing non thesis research."
Applied for a competitive graduate assistant position... did not get it,"I applied for a competitive position. It would have fully funded me, and I felt passionate about the job and fully capable of doing it. I even nailed all of the interviews. They did not offer it to me, though, and now I feel discouraged and worn out.

I’m going to keep trying to get a position at the school to help with my funding. For now, I’m sad and tired."

Supporting two people on a grad student stipend: Does our budget seem reasonable?,"I originally posted this on r/personalfinance but figured you guys may have some useful insights as well. 

Hubby and I are moving to San Diego this fall where I’ll be starting a PhD program. It is fully funded with a $34k (pre-tax) stipend, and I also will have subsidized housing through the university. I have no debt but he has $35k in student loans at 4.2%. We expect he’ll be making decent money once we move there, entry level jobs in his field are around $50-60k and the area’s job market is quite strong. We also have $20k in savings.

Our plan is to basically live off of my stipend and put most or all of his income toward debt payoff and savings/investments (and maybe the occasional vacation once his loans are gone). Here is our proposed monthly budget based solely on my income:

Income: $2833

Taxes: $300 (estimated based on an online calculator; I will not have to pay SS)

Rent: $1100 (includes utilities/internet)

Groceries: $500

Eating out: $100

Car: $0 (paid off, though it’s pushing 150k miles so not sure how much longer it will last)

Car insurance: $150

Gas: $75 (I will commute by bike, he will likely drive)

Phone: $50

Gym: $45

Health insurance: $0 (I’m covered by my university, he’s on his parents’ plan for the next year and hopefully his future job will offer insurance)

Fun/misc expenses: $300

Total expenses: $2620

Based on this budget we should have enough to live on via my stipend, with a bit of a buffer for unexpected expenses. His loans have a $200 minimum payment so we can always tap into our savings if he ever loses his job for a while. 

I’m not local to the area, so I’d like to know whether our proposed budget has any flaws or things that I’m forgetting? We are both very frugal and accustomed to living like broke college students, so I’m hoping this will be doable."

Housing,"Hello,
I'll be moving to Lafayette, Indiana for my doctorate degree. I'll be renting an apartment for the first year but its seems due to limited availability I'll be moving in to apartments that do not provide good service and take away deposits for ""cleaning"" when vacated.

Seeing that I'll be new to a country - USA, I'd like to know what to look out for and not to screw myself over from these people. 

Please advise on:
1. What to look for in lease agreement
2. What to do if the equipments and service mentioned do not function and are not repaired when asked
3. How to claim the deposit back without it being taken away.

Thanks."
Is anyone else working a part time job while in grad school?,"I recently started working a new part time job at a cafe literally 2 blocks from my office. I love my staff and coworkers, I'm making pretty decent money, and the proximity to campus can't be beat. I started working because my apartment complex is insanely more expensive then I originally thought, and I need some extra cash for some things my stipend isn't covering given my current living situation. I'm moving to a cheaper place over the summer (thank god), but I think I'll keep the job for a few more months to start racking up my savings and putting money toward my student loans. I worked two jobs all throughout college, but I'm a little anxious thinking about balancing this one with all my grad work. We'll see how it goes. 

Is anyone else working a job? How is it going?"
I’m not sure what to do,I’m finishing my last class of my 2nd bachelor’s now and it won’t be finished until mid-August and I’m scheduled to start my MS degree in early September. I noticed a hold on my financial aid a while back and they told me don’t worry about it. I contacted them again and they told me they won’t even process it until I give them a final transcript from my current program. I have no idea what to do because I can’t afford this without financial aid.
"Off topic, but does anyone have any cool interior decorating resources for an apartment","Hey all! I'm moving to a new and unfurnished 1-bedroom apartment at the end of next month and am looking for some inspiration, resources, or ideas for really making this place my own. For some context, I currently live in on-campus furnished housing so I'm pretty much starting from scratch, which is stressful, but really exciting because I can actually make this *my* apartment. 

I have a bed, mattress, nightstand, dresser and TV stand on lock but am looking for an affordable couch and dining set that fit with my aesthetic is sort of boho meets minimalist meets masculine. Sort of an urban-outfitters approach, and I really like the look of natural wood and metal. That said, I'm having trouble finding some inspiration. 

What does your apartment look like? What are your must know hacks for really making a place yours? Do you have any advice for me? What are the little pieces and things you think I might forget? Really looking forward to hearing your responses!"
Plus loans to supplement stipend,Has anyone done this? Was it worth it? Im thinking about getting a small loan so i wont be on a razors edge financially.
I enjoyed grad school but looking back I don’t know if it was a good return in investment. How to get over the regret,"I decided to go to a top ranked program for a 1 year masters and didn’t think through better financial options-it was quite a bit, but at the time I felt tuition was worth it for the name and opportunities. And was it? I made incredible friends, took interesting classes, was exposed to interesting research and felt I was in a very stimulating environment and finally felt like I figured out what I really want to do with my career. 

However, now that I’m working I’m depressed and wondering if I made the wrong choice. My first job, I’m making less than the cost of the degree and worked a terrible job. In my second luckily I’ll be making >$20K the cost and hoping to continue working my way up. But I am quite stressed out and wondering if I made a good decision in hindsight. If I researched a bit more and picked a different program, maybe I wouldn’t have had to pay as much or even at all and might have still done this. 

I feel like continuous regrets keep popping up as I think about my overall choices with college and grad school trajectory. Does anybody else feel this way? How do you overcome the feeling? "
Tips for Finances in Grad School?,"Hey guys, does anyone have any tips for keeping yourself afloat in grad school? My program ""strongly discourages"" working but I maintain an almost full-time restaurant job anyway. Things have been fine for now, but this fall I'm expected to complete a required internship on top of my normal amount of classes. This internship will pretty much take away any time I currently have left over for my job, but it isn't paid. I'm at a smaller school that doesn't give stipends to masters-level students, and my loans only cover tuition/textbooks. Any advice?"
Quitting FT Job for Back to Student Life?,"Apologies if this isn’t the right thread but I need some advice from fellow grad students! 

Back story: I had begun my undergrad for nursing and switched degrees for health administration and information systems. I began working for a software company servicing a number of health facilities in a project management/support specialist type role. The job became 24 hours of stress so I moved to Chicago for an adventure - expensive. I now work in sales in the legal industry, and loathe it. Not my personality, and I want to get back to the medical world. 

Going back to school for physical therapy has been a dream at the back of my mind this last year. I’m debating quitting my current position and taking a pay cut to go back to school for the pre requisites I need and to have a more flexible schedule to allow me to obtain observation hours. 

I know many people keep their current jobs when going back to school, but the stress of my current role and lack of flexibility to obtain observation hours for a DPT program worries me. My goal would be to nanny and work part time in a medical office/clinic where I can grow my connection base as well. 

Looking for honest thoughts, opinions, and advice! Thank you!"
Budgeting,"I’m starting grad school this fall in Oregon. My stipend will be $26,500 a year. Is there a good way to predict how much I’ll actually end up with after taxes? I’m trying to figure out a basic budget for me to follow."
I need some help understanding my grad school loan award,"So I filed my FAFSA a few months ago, and today Columbia sent me their loan offer based on my FAFSA info. It's a federal direct unsubsidized loan. My first question is, what does that mean?

Free or low cost online grad school?,"I should preface this post by saying that I know this is a long shot, but are there any free or low cost graduate programs that do online programs?

Accepted to an M.A. but received almost no financial aid. Meeting w/ Director of Admissions next week to ask for more -- any tips for preparing for that conversation?,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I was recently accepted to a fantastic program that I'm so excited about (2-year M.A. in School Counseling). Unfortunately, I received little to no financial aid. My family and I are on OK footing financially, but with a baby and my impending loss of income, I was definitely hoping for more money than this.

&#x200B;

I have a meeting with my school's Director of Admissions next week. I'm willing to defer admission for a year if it comes to that, but I'd really like to start in Fall 2019 if possible.

&#x200B;

What are my options in terms of asking for more aid? Has anyone navigated this tough conversation successfully?

&#x200B;

Background info:

* I am a minority male who would be entering a field dominated by white women. I'm not exactly looking to throw down the race card though, yikes. Is there a way to tactfully highlight the value I bring to this profession?
* I do not have another acceptance letter to ""compare against"", though I don't even know if that's a thing for grad schools....
* School costs \~$36k per year including books, fees, tuition, etc. I received a $2,500/year award that's given to every person in this program. No aid beyond that, from the school or from the government.
* I plan on going part-time (< 20 hours/week) at my current job to help cover the costs of school. My job would pay more than any graduate assistantships on-campus.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!"
Things I learned while refinancing my student loans,"At r/GradSchool most of us have student loans of some sort, so I wanted to share some things I learned from refinancing my student loans that no one seems to talk about. I hope to save you some frustration and a lot of money! At worst, at least you'll have something to benchmark.

Some background - I powered through 3 business degrees and got a good paying job, but I now my \~10 loans are near repayment. 

Credit score ranging from 710-765.  I have 140k all with federal set rates ranging from 3.4-6.8%. Refinancing was definitely a good idea. I ultimately ended up refinancing most of my loans through a combination of SOFI and ELFI (through credible)... see below the underwriter is still MOHELA for both.

1. There's a lot of options in appearance, but in practice there's only a few loan servicers.  MOHELA and Navient (Sallie Mae) are big ones. Most of the websites like SOFI, Credible, ELFI, are just intermediaries, they are *NOT* the underwriter. They do not make the decisions and your loans are still going to be handled by one of the big companies!
2. Companies like SOFI and ELFI are going to have very different terms. Their customer service is mostly BS.  For example, SOFI calls themselves a conservative lender but then has very aggressive payoff schemes where you have to payoff your loans in 5 or 7 years to get the best rates. 
3. The customer service of these intermediaries is worthless, despite how friendly they may be.
4. At the end of the day your income, your credit score, and your overall ability to repay affects your rates... these companies will not share their formulas with you.  *It is in YOUR best interest to spend time playing with the numbers.*  After I verified income, my rate went down and I was thrilled, so I asked for a larger loan (specified another loan), and despite multiple reps assuring me that my rate would not change. Guess what?! It did and it probably will for you. SOFI then tried to get push my application through and attested they had no recollection of a lower rate.  Call them back/modify your application. I removed the other loan and my rate went back down.  Even a 0.25% at 15k is about $40/year, and this stuff can really compound.
5. Your credit score will take some big hits for the process. Two companies, two hard hit and I lost about 40 points. This is the scummy part of how credit works.
6. You might want to consider multiple companies. Aggressive and conservative. I did 25k at a 4.7% rate for 5 years and about 60k at 5.4% for 15 years. This gave me a good mix.  Overall, I will save \~$800 in interest my first year alone. 
7. For academics, these servicers are clueless.  When they verify your income, they use monthly... meaning that if you're paid over 9 months... *cha-ching* for you. They will multiply one month by 12. 

I am not recommending any particular company and only outlining my experience with information I wish I knew beforehand.  This was an incredibly frustrating process but worth it with the savings in the end.  Hopefully, my info/story will help you.

Funding in foreign countries,"I’m a second year student of a bachelor program in physics in Italy so there will be much time for me to think where to apply.

However I’d like to understand better how things work for graduate students: how do you apply for a graduate course in foreign countries? What requirements do you need? How does funding work?

I did some research but it’s still not completely clear to me.

To be more specific, let’s pick Caltech and Cambridge as examples: what are the main differences between the two for a PhD in physic?

If you have experience of other universities those are also welcome.

Thanks in advance"
"I need to raise approx $1200 for a research trip to Angola, any ideas?","South African PhD student here. As the title says, I need to raise approximately $1400 for a research trip to Angola in September 2019.

Financial Advice for International PhD Student Starting in Fall 2019,"Hello fellow Redditors, 

I have got accepted for a PhD in the United States with a fellowship that I believe will be very adequate for the monthly expenses. However, I have a couple of questions on the practicality of initially embarking on my studies. I would be thankful to hear your opinion and experience on these questions.

1. When did you move to the US? My classes start in the first week of September. I think I need to settle in before that. How in advance 
2. How did you finance yourself for the first months before getting your first stipend? Did you get stipend in advance for the first month.
3. I understand that there will be costs upfront like housing advance. How did you manage these? I do not have a lot of savings. Did you get any assistance from the university?
4. Did you buy one way tickets or return tickets for the flights to the US?"

Also, how many of you have actually successfully received such extramural fellowships? TIA! 😊"
Is My Covered Tuition Considered Income?,Hello everyone. I am pursuing a PhD and my department covers tuition and pays me a $25000 yearly stipend.

This summer I am doing research in a biophysics lab at the same university as my MS program doing some computational biology work. Theoretically, if I were able to prove myself a good worker/researcher, would they allocate some funding(idc how much, anything would help) to let me be a researcher during my MS? I know I am getting ahead of myself but I just want to know if this is a possibility."
How much money to budget for the very beginning of graduate school?,"I’m currently working a gap year job while applying to Neuroscience PhD programs. I have already budgeted ~$1200 for all the costs associated with applications, and now I am trying to figure out how much money I need to set aside for actually starting graduate school. This could include things like moving costs, apartment security deposit, supporting myself while I await my first paycheck, etc. For reference I will most likely end up in a fairly pricey city (Boston, San Diego, etc.) and I will be living with my fiancé, who may or may not have a job lined up by that point. It’s possible that I could be supporting both of us for a little while until he finds work. 

Would anyone be willing to share how much they spent up-front when starting graduate school? "

Planning an M.S. in Applied Math Focused on Finance with Goal of CS PhD. Thoughts?,"I have an undergraduate B.S. degree in pure Mathematics. I'm currently planning on applying for M.S. Programs in Applied Mathematics with a focus on Finance and Business. I will do an internship over the summer.

Of course, I will choose a program with a Master's thesis and I will try to publish journal/conference papers during the degree.

I am currently going to school online in Computer Science taking undergraduate courses. By the time I start my Masters in Applied Math, I will have taken the courses 'Computer Organization I & II', 'Algorithms and Data Structures', 'Operating Systems', 'Graph Theory/Discrete Math II', 'Analysis of Algorithms and Complexity', and 'Database Theory'.

I am working on personal projects in programming. How competitive would this make me for PhD positions in Math or CS?

I assume all of this is important: side/personal projects in Machine Learning, strong letters & personal statement, high gre score, networking, great grades, spending some time on research after graduation."
"Why do Funded PhD Students ""Pay"" for Tuition?","I understand paying for tuition if you have to take some classes before you do your phd research, but when you're in your upper years, why do the schools still consider themselves ""paying"" for tuition?

Edit: I'm getting the impression that it's not well known and differs greatly by institution, yet it's weird because it's an industry-wide practice."
Living at my mom's to save money during Master's or go move to the program further away?," 

Got accepted to both Masters of Public Health programs at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and University of Virginia (UVA) in Virginia this fall and will be moving back down from DC but am on the fence about which would set me up better career wise and whether the cost of livings savings from going to VCU offsets it's less stellar program. Tuition cost isn't a factor since work is paying for it (yay!) Here is what I perceive to be pros and cons right now but if anyone can add to these or correct my assumptions that would be great

VCU

Pros: Older program est. in the 90s, Great reputation for health sciences and probably the best reputation for MPH in the state (VA as a whole doesn't have crazy good programs but whatever), good reputation for their epi program, cheap or potentially free cost of living if I decide to live with my mom, Richmond is my hometown so I'm very familiar with the area and still have friends there, Connections with state dept of health and state capitol being nearby, research focus on tobacco use which is line with my personal interests and background.

Cons: Generalist program (no concentrations offered), health policy dept doesn't seem to do much with the MPH program and that's the field I'm more interested in, I've heard rumors that the PhD program is disorganized but the MPH program ""should be fine"" and VCU administration is a bit of a clusterfuck

UVA

Pros: Offers health policy, law, and ethics concentration that appeals to me, opportunity to get a degree from the best public school in the state, new experience with living in Charlottesville, connections with the Batten School for Public Policy, stronger potential for networking with alums if I decide to get involved with politics, new data science school is forthcoming

Cons: Newer program as of 2007 with un-established reputation, a bit higher cost of living compared with Richmond, do not have many current connections with the city and probably wouldn't want to stay there after I graduate

Thanks for your help!"
"Debt debt, crippling debt","So I want to go to grad school because I feel like I’m at a stalemate in my life. I’m not exactly in the field I want to be in (let’s say it’s adjacent to it) and the jobs I want I don’t feel like I’m experienced enough for. 

I love learning and I love going to school. I just graduated in May and I miss it so much already. I’ve looked at a couple programs and I have found three I really like. 

The only problem is $$$.

"""You will not be eligible to apply for financial aid until you are registered for coursework.""","Hey all,
I'm like 99% sure I'm going accept my admissions offer to go to grad school at my alma mater, UIUC.

They offered me a tuition waiver, which is amazing. However, I still need to find a way to cover the costs of food/housing. I obviously filed the FAFSA months ago, but I guess they can't tell me what financial aid I'm getting until I enroll for courses (according to their acceptance email)

The only problem is, I can't register for courses until their new student welcome event in June.

How am I supposed to sign a lease for an apartment next year if I don't even know what aid I'm getting? 😢 I'd rather not wait until June to sign a lease, but I also don't think it would be the smartest idea to sign a lease before I find out what my financial aid is. My family's EFC is 0, so I'm dirt poor.

Even if I somehow don't get any need-based financial aid, I would only need about $7000-$10000 to afford the cost of food/housing/textbooks for the one year that I'd be in grad school. I was offered good aid from UIUC (tuition grants) during my undergrad and I only have about $8000 in student loans right now. 

I was offered about $20,000 in loans by another grad school (that I'm not attending), so if I was offered that by another school, do you all think it would be likely that I would be offered a similar amount by UIUC?

Sorry, I know this post was a hot mess, but if anyone can address any of the points I made in the post then that would be greatly appreciated. Also, please don't say ""talk to the office of financial aid"", because I'll be talking to them this Sunday :) just thinking about this is giving me massive anxiety so it would be helpful if someone could help me with this asap lol"
Stipend issues,My school has been overpaying me for months. Here I am thinking I got a small raise because my direct deposit went up. Aside from “I should have noticed” do you think it’s right for them to ask for their money back (not through small repayments)? I don’t see a lot of that money because it was taxed. They won’t even wait for my tax return to give them the money. 
"Free food etiquette, ""from the other side""","I am also a grad student and I like to eat. I have attended events where free food was a big part of my motivation, and I often eat my fill. And I like providing people with food and hate food waste.

However, now that I have been helping my advisor organize a conference at our school, we unfortunately had to ""kick out"" a few people who came just for the food and did so in a stupid, arrogant and/or disruptive way. So I would like to give some guidelines to new students at my school, and generally everyone interested in free food, to increase chances of actually getting food and avoiding getting kicked out and awkward situations. Of course, this is open to discussion and criticism, but here's what I've come up with from this experience:

\- If the attendees are paying to attend the event (e.g., it's a not-only-internal conference), you most likely can't just enter and help yourself. Don't try to lie your way in, or at least not in a stupid way - don't say you are an organizer / an organizer's student, because these people asking you who you are at the entrance are likely to be the organizers' students themselves or to call and check. There may be a back door through which you still can enter...

\- In any case, if you intend to mix in with the attendees, dress appropriately so that you don't stand out too much: at least it needs to be clean, without visible holes, and fancier than old sweatpants+sweatshirt. The standards may be higher if there are important guests (e.g., professors) from countries with higher clothing standards, such as most of Europe and Southeast Asia, and some organizers care to not be embarrassed about that. \[I am in Israel, where this especially needs to be said, but this should also be an important notice for many students in/from some other countries such as the US.\]

\- Eat politely and moderately enough to not attract attention. If there is only a little food (compared to the number of people present), don't try to stuff yourself, but only take one serving (until the attendees have finished eating).

\- Don't say anything offensive or controversial; if someone tries to make small talk with you, usually the best strategy is to get them to talk about their work.

\- If it is a sort of a sit-down meal, if tables and chairs are provided especially for the event, most likely the chairs and cutlery are counted and extra people will be noticed, and a problem as some of the actual attendees won't get a sensible place to sit. I just sent such extra, unregistered students (and some registered students who brought them) to eat in the hallway, where there happened to be some more tables and chairs, as we had a plenty of food so the only problem was sitting space, but some organizers may be less accommodating.

\- Usually the safest, easiest and most reasonable strategy (especially if you can't dress and behave properly and/or are in a totally different field of studies) is coming right after the meal, i.e. right after the beginning of the following lecture, after the attendees entered the lecture hall, and helping yourself to the buffet leftovers. Politely asking the servers, cleaners and such staff about leftovers should also be fine (unless you are in a place where the local law forbids it). Obviously, don't try to fill leftovers containers while the attendees are still helping themselves."
Advice wanted for grad school choice,"Hi all, I’m hoping you can help me with this decision.

I’m hoping to go to grad school for a position that needs a grad degree in order for me to practice. (Licensed Mental Health Counselor)

I’m planning on going in 18 months after saving enough money to not take out any loans in order to go.

Currently I live in a HCOL area in affordable housing (read: about 20% of my income) and make about $52,000 a year. My job is manageable and provided good health care and benefits but not what I want to do for long term.

The decision is this:

I could apply to a state school program of which only 6 people get in each year, where I have to take two courses at a community college and a GRE before applying. The program costs $26,000 in tuition over a two years being a full-time student. I would have to move to the town where the school is (and housing is more affordable there) but I would have to quit my job and give up benefits. The kicker is, I have the options of working as a Teaching Assistant and having that pay for most of my tuition. So the program is essentially free minus what I need to stay alive, which isn’t much. Also, I could not get in initially and have to wait another year before applying again.

OR

I could go to CityU, pay $52,000, rolling admission and more lax application process but the program is three years and designed to be done while working a full-time job. I wouldn’t have to quit or move, and I wouldn’t get the opportunity to teach college classes.

Do I go through the hoops and try to go to the practically free full-time program or do I try to balance both work and school to pay for a more expensive part-time program but would hopefully get to continue working at my job?

I know this is probably a “well do what you value more” kind of question, so if that’s where you’re leaning please tell me what you would do in this situation.

Thanks to anyone who participates!"
Advice on finding scholarships?,Best places to look?

Nonetheless, my parents have been asking me to look at doing my PhD outside of the US specifically in the UK and in particular because of cost. I have not given this much thought, but does anyone have experience doing a Masters or PhD outside of the US? How much weight does it hold? Is there that much of a difference in cost \(feel what's more important is how well funded the program is\)? Any tips on looking for programs? Thanks in advanced.      "

Are the better facilities worth that much more when job placement out of pt school is already as good as it is? Thanks for any help."
"Terrified of grad school debt, looking for solidarity — am I alone?","Hi there. I’m starting grad school in a major US city in the fall. The program is a great fit for me and it’s highly regarded. The catch is that tuition is ~50k a year. Additionally, my rent will be around $900 a month (a deal considering the city I’ll be living in).

I only have around 5k in savings and the school didn’t offer me any scholarships. In fact, only a few people in this program are offered scholarships and they are pretty small (around 13k). I obviously knew all this when I enrolled but reality has begun to set in and I’m having terrible anxiety about all the loans I’m going to have to take out over the next two years. 

My anxiousness has me assuming that everyone else who is going to grad school is in a better situation than me. I think they must have more savings, have rich parents or they must have gotten hefty scholarships. 

I’m not looking to be told that I made a bad decision. I can’t turn back now. I just want to know if anyone else out there is in a similar situation. 

Am I the only one who will have so much debt? "
Graduate loans question,"So my work does tuition reimbursement but I was wondering if I could style it such that I take a loan out and pay for tuition, but then take the reimbursement money and pay off the loan. Or take a say, 3-4 year loan, that covers tuition as it occurs since I have to work full-time as I'm going to grad school to get the reimbursement, then pay of principal as I go? Is that actually more like a line of equity than a loan? Basically was wondering if there's a way to have a revolving line of credit that has no interest for a period of time that I can pay off as I go/use as I go to pay tuition as needed, probably up to 5-7k a semester?"
Expected salary post graduation,"Hey there, does anyone have any good resources for what the market value of someone who is coming out of school?

For example, I have my business admin BS, biomedical engineering BS, and MS of mechanical engineering and have no idea what is fair to ask for (going into industry). Any advice or resources are appreciated. I would kill for some kind of estimate/calculation. "
Parents offered to pay for MA,"I'll be starting an MA this fall, and will be going to a PhD after that. My parents have offered to pay for my entire MA + living expenses. I've accepted their offer, but I feel weird about it. They're not the type that would hold this over me in the future. They wholeheartedly want to me pursue my academic dreams. Is it wrong to feel this way? I feel kind of immature, as if my MA is like my undergraduate, which my parents also paid for. I'd appreciate any thoughts. Thanks"
What are some feasible ways to make money whilst studying?,"Besides a part-time job... Rather, something that is relied upon self-employment.

I will be doing my Computing MSc this year."
Loan my way through Grad School to avoid work?,"Greetings /r/GradSchool,

I'm going to be entering grad school this fall to attempt to get my Master's in Computer Science, and I had some questions about loans that I can't get a consistent answer on.

Essentially, I want to focus my time and energy on school and really make it count.  I'm going to have to take out loans to pay for tuition and most likely to supplement my cost of living (since I will no longer be able to work full time while going to school).  The question then becomes:  should I just get loans to cover my entire cost of living for the duration I'll be in school (~2 years)?  I (optimistically) plan on having a decent career coming out of school, so significant student loan debt seems worth it, but I'm not sure how others feel about it.

I've talked to friends who have been/are in grad school, and their experiences are varied.  Some have taken out significant loans even during undergrad (I currently have 0 student loans), and some paid out of pocket while working during grad school (albeit, in a program that might not be as intensive as the one I'm going into).

How much is too much?  Or should I plan on working half-time during the semester?

I'll also note that I'm dismissing any possible scholarships or internships for the sake of simplicity and covering my bases.  Essentially I'd like to know that I have everything covered going into school, and anything I can take off the top I will as I go.

Thanks for any advice!"
Is going for a Doctorate Financially Worth It?,"For the following year I have been accepted into a prestigious PhD program with a TA position which will cover three years of coursework. Thus far, I have not acquired any debt or have taken on any loans. I will be going straight from a BA in Music Education (as of a month ago, I'm a fully certified K-12 music teacher) to a PhD in Musicology (a field I'm very passionate about and may want to teach at the college level).    
    
Right now, I consider myself to be in a very good financial spot for someone my age. I've been saving my money since I was 16, and have a nice bank account to show for it (nothing too crazy, but much better than many of my peers). After speaking to a myriad of professors in the program, I've been told the average amount of time taken to graduate is 5-6 years, meaning that if I fall into the mean, I will take on 2.5 years worth of debt. The school is a public institution whose tuition is not too high ($11,000 per semester), but by the time I pay the tuition for multiple years, have to pay for living expenses, etc, I feel that I will be deep in the hole. I have the option to only opt for a Masters, which would be fully paid for, but I feel that would be less fruitful that a PhD, and does not expand my horizons by much. My bachelors degree allows me to teach, which means I am not necessarily set for financial ruin if graduate school does not work out, so at the very least, I have financial options and I love to teach.     
    
tl;dr: Does anyone who is currently on, or has completed a PhD have any insight regarding personal finances. Although the first several years are paid for, the thought of being debt free to potentially six figures in debt is scary."
Opinion on living situation/budget for grad students,"TLDR: 1000 rent and utilities, 20 minute commute vs. 500 rent and utilities, hour and half commute - 2300/month stipend.  Can I afford to break the 30% rule?

I'm starting my PhD program this fall.  I will be moving an hour and half drive away from my husband who is going to remain at the job he loves and eventually move to the city with me once he finds something that will provide comparable pay and job satisfaction.

As for me, I will be receiving about 2300 a month from my fellowship, and I've been looking at 1 bedroom apartments or the option of living with a friend short term (6 months - 1 year) in her condo, while I wait to see if my husband finds something.

If I go with the 1 bedroom apartment, my finances will look like this:

* income: 2300
* rent: 850
* utilities (including internet): ~150 (it gets cold in winter)
* phone: 50
* car insurance: 75
* food: 200
* IRA (I'm being pushed to almost max it out): 400
* renters insurance: 15
* Hulu/netflix/amazon prime: ~30
* Cat: ~25
* Commute: 20 minutes on bus since there is no parking on campus during weekdays

If I live with my friend temporarily, I will pay about 500 a month in rent/utilities (instead of ~1000), but I will need to commute an hour and half on the bus since the bus route and transfers to and from her condo are clunky.  Other expenses should look similar.

Is the extra 500 worth it for a much longer commute as a 1st year grad student?  Will I be okay with almost half of my income going to rent and utilities (when the recommended percentage is 30%)?  I'm reluctant to get a roommate because I don't know when or if my husband will find a job over the next year and I'm not comfortable living with someone I don't know.  I also find it difficult to live and function under extremely noisy conditions, so I'm trying to find quieter buildings.

I should have a solid 3-4 month security fund saved up (if I were to live in the 1bed apartment), and I don't have any debt."
Does this type of living arrangement exist?,"TLDR; I am willing to pay 2-3 hundo a month for a bed and a shower on Monday night/Tuesday morning only for class. Is this realistic or completely unheard of? Help.

I’m a full time employee for an agency that is paying my college tuition. Unfortunately they do not allow online courses and the campus is over 25 miles from my house but only 5 miles from my work—plus it is a downtown campus so parking will be brutal and I’ll probably park at a Starbucks uptown and hop on the light rail. I’m looking to take 2 classes on Monday nights from 2pm to 9pm and then a Tuesday class from 6-9pm. 

I would really like to have a place to crash on Mondays near the light rail or campus. I would just need to sleep, shower and go to work the next morning to save insane amounts of time and I would LOVE to avoid city commute—possibly even bus to work. I would be willing to pay up to $250-$300 a month for this type of arrangement—again, it would only be Monday night weekly for a semester. Is this unheard of? Where would I go to find people willing to do this? Obviously it would be supplemental income rather than a full blown sublet. I’ve thought about talking with hotels or making Airbnb arrangements. I could pay entire semester upfront. Should I just suck it up and waste 2-3 hours on the freeway every day? I own my home and moving isn’t an option at this moment because I love my house. Not sure how to proceed. "
Should I take a break after graduating with my B.S. and how should I optimize my break time if I do?,"Please be patient if I sound ignorant, I’m the first of my intermediate family (including aunts and cousins, and great aunts etc...) to even make it to college, with some of them not even graduating high school. So I’m a little foggy on this situation. 

So here’s my story - I’m a commuting student that will be going into my senior year next year. And to put it bluntly I don’t think I’m financially ready to pack up and go to grad school, assuming I’ll even get in. 

I’m taking a hit with a 2.9-3.0 GPA after a freshman year that was basically worth nothing after transferring and a personal disaster my sophomore year after I transferred, although my  junior year alone is a 3.5. Since I commute and work so much I have trouble finding comfy internships and experience, which is important in my field (animal science). 

I currently work at a job related to my major, and I have experience at shelters, vet clinics, campgrounds (teaching children about animals) , and I’ve completed 2 independent studies last year and have one lined up this upcoming year, all related to animals. Although I feel like this isn’t enough. 

I want to get into an M.S. program for my major but, as mentioned above, I don’t feel anywhere ready. I can’t even afford the GRE right now, no kidding. 

I was wondering if it would be wise for me financially and academically to take a break. I want time to get more experience and credentials, take my GRE, and even visit my desired schools (which costs a TON of money). 

Would a break year hurt my chances of getting in? Should I go back and fix some classes or gain more experience? 

Any and all insight is appreciated. "
Is it typical to not know how you’re funded/where the research funds come from?,"Hi all, I’m an engineering grad student. My advisor has switched the source accounts that pay my stipend a few times and I don’t know the account number used for ordering supplies. Is this typical? When I ask my advisor about how I’m paid, I’m told that students shouldn’t be concerned with this stuff. The issue is I originally came in on an intramural fellowship that came with an annual travel award and I would like to use those travel funds for a conference. I’m planning on calling the business office to check but I’m wondering if this situation is normal?"
Question regarding graduate assistantship eligibility,"I’m not sure if this differs by university, but here goes:

If I earn a masters degree, and decide to pursue a 2nd masters degree in a different field soon after, would I be ineligible to obtain a graduate assistantship position opportunity towards that second masters?

I’m considering earning a masters degree in teaching, and want to know if I decide later on to earn a second masters in a different field will I be ineligible for financial aid and/or GA positions.

Thank you. "
Should I stick with the Student Health Insurance or sign up for an individual health insurance plan?,"Currently, I'm enrolled full-time in a 2-year MA program for Clinical Mental Health Counseling. I'm in my first semester and sort of passively enrolled in the student health insurance plan. I didn't fill out the Waiver form. I did this because I no longer had medical insurance (UnitedHealthcare) after leaving my previous full-time job to move to the area for school (nothern Virginia). The insurance cost for the 2018-2019 academic year is $1,970. I've taken out graduate loans and some of the loans are going toward covering that cost. 

&#x200B;

I got to thinking, though. Would it be more financially feasible for me to sign up for an individual plan? Would it be less expensive? I briefly checked quotes for UHC based on my personal information, and it shows a monthly premium of about $55. That seems it would be less costly and would allow me to allocate the loan money toward something more important. Furthermore, the deadline for waiving the student health insurance isn't until early October. 

&#x200B;

I know there's a lot of factors to consider here, like what benefits I have with the student health insurance and what the actual monthly cost would be for, say, an individual UHC plan. I intend to contact the insurance provider to get more info, and speak with someone from the Health Center to learn more about my benefits. I doubt my Financial Aid office would be sympathetic to my query since they (understandably) want me to carry the university health insurance. But I was wondering if, in a general sense, it would seem reasonable to ditch the student insurance and get my own. "
Struggling with funding and financial planning.,"I'm preparing to start a master's at George Mason in anthropology, I'm super excited about this opportunity and I can't wait to get started on my research!

However, as its getting closer to my start date, I'm realizing I only have enough saved for maybe one semester. I've been offered a federal loan of about $20,000/year and then about $2,800 in tuition reduction and another $2800 in a living stipend. Even with that money, I'd owe $3,300 out of pocket.

Given the absurd cost of living in the DC/ Northern Virginia area, this has been a really tough process and I'm not sure I have enough saved to afford the cost of attendance. I'm really struggling with trying to figure out my options here. If I try to defer for a year, I would have much more saved up (considering I just managed to work up to a high enough position at work to build savings, I'm currently bar tending as my gap year is coming to a close) to make it work and be in a place to develop a well-thought thesis and apply for more funding. However, I'm not sure how my advisor would react to my wanting/needing to put off school for another year.

I really don't want to defer, but I'm not sure what options I have. I could get some help from family but my parents have a few medical conditions that are taking up a lot of their finances at the moment. Any help/advice would be appreciated!

edit: loan is 20k, not 10 actually"
"Grad School, good gpa, good portfolio, but a low Credit Score","So yeah I know it might be similar questions asked but with my situation is a little bit different (or the same.) I am planning on applying for the Savvanh College of art and Design for Winter 2019. With everything in check, I would have a 3.3-3.5 when I graduate from ungrad school in the Fall, and my portfolio will be a strong one (hoping it is) to submit, however while reading up on other things, one requirement is to fill out the Fafsa form with a positive credit score.  So far now, my credit score is a 555. It has gotten that low because of a situation back in January 2013 where I applied for phone services along with a parent under altell. What i didn't fail to realize is that that parent was going to dissapear. What made the situation worse is that he ranned the bill from 80 to 200. Unable to pay it (since we did not have access to the account information.) I found out a couple of years later that altell closed and was bought by AT-T which now said I owed 515 USD. Without a stable job and my stupid self thinking that he will pay it (which he winded up not doing) My credit score took a hit. However two years ago, I opened an account with Verizon and made monthly payments up now, not missing a single one. I checked my credit score a couple of weeks ago and the only negative thing on my balance is from that and the loans I borrowed from my current college that was waived.  Since I am applying to SCAD should I be worried about not being able to get the loans to pay for these classes?  I read somewhere that I might have a chance to pull loans from a grad school if my credit wasn't adverse (Not exceeding 2,048 dollars). Another thing I read that I could put in an appeal to explain that a situation for the bad credit wouldn't more likely to occur again. 
I am not sure how entirely true it is but I wanted to see if I still have the chance of getting what I need for SCAD?"
Get paid to edit papers?,Anyone know of any companies where you can get paid to edit college papers? Seems like it would make good extra spending money in grad school.
Grad School Fellowship Questions,"Hello all,

I recently subscribed to this community. I started a month ago a little early for a masters program in geology. I strongly feel as though I will want to pursue a PhD but was waiting to see how much I like research full time before then. I think I will decide maybe October or November. 

I am debating applying for fellowships whose deadlines are late this fall. However I am not sure it is worthwhile- I likely will not have published or presented by then (though will have some preliminary results and data, I hope to definitely present this spring). And, I am very new in the program. 

However I did present a little in undergraduate, was extremely involved in extra-curricular activities (a trend I plan on continuing), received several scholarships, graduated with honors *et cetera*. I know my project, and am really starting to focus in on my career and personal goals. 

I guess my question is, is it worthwhile to take the time to really make a good application? And if I plan on getting a PhD, should I just wait till next year when I am more competitive since I'll still have a long time to go yet? I am already funded through an RA and full tuition waiver. 

Thanks all, hope to get some good feedback. "
Question about funds for thesis project? (Canadian),"Hello! I'm a current master's student in Canada with a question about research funding for thesis projects. I'm currently holding a national scholarship, so I myself am being funded to complete my MSc, but my thesis project is not funded by any of my supervisor's grants, so I guess the project itself counts as unfunded?

Basically I'm having trouble recruiting participants for my thesis project without any sort of compensation (people have emailed me, stating their interest, but then pull out of participating once they realize they won't be compensated for the 30\-minute interview). **I was wondering whether it would be appropriate for me to ask my supervisor if I could use some of their research funds as compensation for my study participants** (say, maybe a $5 coffee shop gift card for each of them).

I'm just not really sure how the funding of graduate student thesis projects usually works (does it vary by country? or by school?), and was wondering if anybody could give me any clarification regarding this issue. Thanks in advance."
Are there any scholarships left to apply for?,"So I may be jumping the gun on this as I do not yet have an admission decision, but hopefully this will help other people if not me.  I have my master's in psychology, and about a month ago my grad school announced that they are starting a PhD program in my same department, with the first cohort starting in September.  They need a ""trial"" cohort to go through the program in order to gain accreditation from American Psychological Association, and brochure says the program will be free to this trial cohort.  

So I apply, and I got an interview.  Interview went ok, I left feeling it could go either way.  Since my interview I have found out that the program would not be totally free- I'd have to pay for roughly 4 credits per semester at least until I get done with classes (could be as little as one year since I got my master's from same school in same department).  My estimates come to about $4k per semester including tuition, fees, and books.  I don't know how their partial funding would work when it comes time to do dissertation.  Also, if I get accepted and do this, they will have a program rule that students cannot work more than 20 hours per week at our everyday jobs.

If I were to get in, does anyone have ideas for how I could come up with the $4k by September?  I work full-time now so I could haul ass and work a ton until then, but free money is always preferable so that I can save a ton to help with living expenses should I do this.  I've started doing google searches but so far most scholarships are already being given out.  I'd look into assistantships but that would mean quitting my current job, and I'd rather keep that since it's in the psych field.  Loans are not an option- already $140k in debt from undergrad and master's and I am NOT adding to that.  

Thanks in advance for any/all advice!"
Funding for international postgraduate students in Spain,"Hi all, 
Sorry for this dull question but I can't seem to get a clear answer on whether or not I can get a graduate loan (or grant.. if that still exists!) as an EU student studying on a masters course in Spain?  I'm thinking of the Erasmus+ loan in particular. Anyone out there have any recent experience of this? Or any experience of banks you've banked with in Spain as an international student would also be helpful. Thanks in advance "
